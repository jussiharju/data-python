not only in caves and rockshelters but in great winlercatnps
where they built clusters of houses made of timbers and
covered with hides many sketches of which they have jcft
for our information but they were nomads and in summer
wandered in hunting and fish ing bands for there is
no evidence that agri culture was practised they had excellent
weapons of chipped stone for both warfare and hunting and
probably used bows and ar rows they made various hooks
and spears for fishing and tools of stone bone and
norn for the preparation of skins for sewing and other
household purposes but they made no potter in some regions
they advanced in culture more than elsewhere they spread in
aurimiacian times from the upper danube in the east to
belgium and britain in the west but southern france was
the most populous there it was that their life came
to be most settled and the extraordinary art that distinguished
the aurignadan time was most highly developed the soil of
the caves occupied by the people of this period and
the sites of their campinc places abound in small flintflakes
carefully pointed into delicate engraving tools among them one shaped
just like a modern buhn it was with these gravers
that they cut from ivory and soap stone statuettes of
animal and human figures or incised on slabs of slate
tusks flat bones antlers and especially on the walls of
grottoes pictures of the beasts about them scenes of the
chase drawings of their houses etc sketched not only witb
startling fidelity to nature but with an artistic sense marvdous
in the circumstances they had a love of beauty an
instinct for true art which led them to try to
ornament everything they used bnd this art was steadily cultivated
and developed until il reached its astonishing culmination in magdalenian
times the cutting ottt of figures in basrelief from stone
surfaces ltusually a cavern wall and the modeling of statuettes
are distinctively aurignacian and in thii stage also painting had
its birth for many of the colored drawings that adorn
the walls and ceilings of the caves date from this
period for examples the redoutlined bison and aurochs in the
grotto of castillo spain and the spirited drawings in red
ochre of the woolly rhinoceros and of a stag in
the cave at font de ganme france in many cases
the aurig nacian anist carved the outlines and distin guishing
features of his subject in deeply in cised lines with
minute atiestton to duracter istic details therefore zoologists find some
of these portraits of aniisbls valuable to then particularly with
reference to the history of norses in europe tile picture
whose outlines were thus engraved was then coated with a
red dish or yellowish paint composed of ochre and manganese
mixed on a palette of schisl sohitresn cultnre the auriimaciaii
stage was succeeded by the solutrean this horiion is distinguished
by the presence in its remains of the most delicately
and perfectly worked leafshaped flints for knives heads of spears
javelins and arrows and in general by a sud den
great improvement in the manufacture and design of all objects
made of flint or quru this skilful culture evidences of
whitii are hread from the lower danube valley to the
bay of biscay b believed to be the product of
fresh immigration of people from the teeming east who moved
westward along the northern border of the black sea and
advanced up the danube valw and finally became predominant in
southern europe yet it seeitts plain that the cromagnons were
not utterly destroyed even there and thai both in northern
euro and south of the pyrenees they persisted ra force
these invading solutrean folks who take their name from a
vast camp ringed with the turfcovered bones of tens of
thousands of horses slaughtered for food near solutr in southern
france were a practical people ruder than those they had
overcome and during their time art declined magdalenian cultare comparative
re finement revived however during the succeed ing ste the
magdalenian when art was de veloped to its highest perfection
in prehistory whatever may have been the racial character of
the solutrean people the magdalencan folk were unquestionably of cromagnon
stock whit was the occasion of the change that ar
cfakologists note at this point can only be conlt jertured
but the fact is plain these magda lenian cromagnons attained
in this period their highest culture and widest dispersion of
the race they have been traced northward to england and
central belgium and eastward throughout central germany but never ap
parently colonized italy or southern spain they were as before
a nomadic and hunter people but by this time the
cold wet climate had gradually softened into a warmer and
dry ing one and the growth of dense forests every
where made the chase more and more difificuh and arduous
moreover the animals going in herds such as the reindeer
wild cattle and magdalenians gradually became less nomadic and depended
more on fishing than on hunting for subsistence under these
sedentary and softening influences the craft of the flintworfcer declined
for only poor and simnle kinds of stone implements are
recovered from village this time of decay but the villagesites
chiefly made of bone the style is quite new and
now are first seen round and barbed irane spearheads the
earliest with only an experi mental barb but later always
furnished with rows of recurved barbs along their sides in
this quiver life wfcere in ae lonsettled dgt google favorable
and populous districts of southern france and the neighboring border
of spain the people must have obtained a firm tribal
organi lation the magdalcnians acquired that power of draftsmanship sculpture
and painting that has astonished die critical world and has
been il lustrated so thoroughly in several recent books as
diok of sollas elliot and osborn and in the annual
reports of the smithsonian institolion not to mention the many
learned writings iu frendi spanish and german nearly all the
finest painting of this period as well as that of
the aurignacian artists is on the walls and ceilings of
deep and totally dark caverns a fact that has caused
much speculation as to the motive that carried such art
into places where the work could be made or observed
only by lamplight it would appear remarks osborn that the
love of art for arts sake together with the fine
spaces which these cav erns alone afforded for large representations
may be an alternative explanation aziliantardenoibibn lavuionthe de cline of
the cromagnons may have been owing largely to environmental causes
but it may have been accelerated by the arrival probably
occasioning long battling of two streams of newcomers one of
which known as the ahh ans spread all over france
and belnm and the other the tardenois occupied spain at
first but gradually coalesced with the other their flints are
small and peculiar totally unlike any uiing used by the
cromagnons this may have been the result of a necessary
change in the character of hunting weapons for now southern
europe was covered with heavy for ests the reindeer had
retreated to the north and the stag was the principal
gameanimal in fact the people seem to have depended mainly
on fishing tor subsistence the climate was still cool and
moist and therefore the use of caves and rockshehers continued
but otherwise the habits and culture of these final races
of paleoulhic man in southern europe were to tally direrent
from without being much in ad vance of those of
the magdalenians who were these final faleolithsp the azilians were
a brachycephalic people the first of that type to appear
in the west and it is believed that ih may
represent the firstcomers of the alpine or celtic race of
modem ethnology they are often deugnated as the purfooz stocil
the other was a longandnarrowheaded race that came in from
northern africa via spain and are thought to represent the
earliest indication of what sergi calls the mediterranean race it
is evident that both were mentally superior tck and more
broadly cultivated than the cro magnons except in artistic matters
and sub dued the latter completely yet there is evidence
that in southern france at least large commu nities of
crouagnons continued to live and develop and have persisted there
to the present day after a few centuries however these
aiiliantardenois men the last of the purely hunting races themselves
suffered displacement fay the incoming of a more advanced people
trioving westward along the great uediterranemi highway of mieration and
with their disappear ance the old stone age comes to
an end neolithic or tbe aft of pokahed stone the
notion formerly prevalent that there was a sudden clearing away
of paleolitliic men and things and an tqumy sudden snpercession
of neolithic people and culture has been aban doned before
the progress of information men in different parts of the
world have always ad vanced toward better conditions at an
unequal pace and in most cases as for example our
north american indians who at the time of their discovery
by europeans were in the neo lithic stage no evidence
can be found of just bow or when the advanced
step was taken in southern europe where circumstances favor a
clearer local understanding of prehistory it appears probable that between
7000 and 10000 years ago strangers beeran to filter in
from the eastward along the mediterranean shores and to settle
in selected spots and that this process went on not
always peacefully we may imagine until the inferior occupiers of
the land had been displaced or absorbed and educated and
the superior culture was generally established a matter probably of
a few ceo turies these immigrant conquerors who brought with
them new arts of life and dis possessed the wandering
hunters introduced 10 western europe the neolithic age whether a
similar conquest or a more peaceful process of intellectual development
produced the same re sult in other parts of the
world remains to be discovered in the earlier part of
iheir history at least the neolithic men continued to make
and use strong hatchets picks flakeknives etc of flint and
quartz but the patterns were more serviceable and they introduced
an entirely new article in the stout axe the chisellike
celt and other tools made of granite jasper and other
tough rocks and formed bj hammering grinding and then often
polismng this is the distinctive mark of the neolithic period
but other dstinctive innovations followed of which the most important
socially perhaps was the tnakin of pottery they had the
rudiments of agncultnre had domesticated the dog and ox and
pig refused to hunt horses for food but captured and
tamed them and to carry on these domestic industries th
were settled in defen sive houses and villages an excelllent

study of these is often termed stereotomy it involves some
knowledge of architecture and very exact calculations sup pose that
stones are required to be cut for an arch of

that rosecrans left was crossing the river to attack breckinridge
the order was countermanded it was ascertained that the in
formation of an attack upon breckinridge was incorrect upon which
bragg ordered breck inridge to send two brigades to report
to hardee and soon after gave him a second or
derto leave one brigade east of stone river and march
with the rest of his cotnmand to hardees support when

of preston and palmer which were sent forward and speedily
repulsed cannonading continued until nightfall when eihausted by a conflict
of full 10 hours duration rarely surpassed for its continued

guns and wagons and taking nearly 2000 prisoners rosecrans losses
during the amy had been appalling and when night came
he was in some doubt whether to remain on the

traversed was about 1600 yards at 4 pm the signalgnn
was fired and the four brigades advanced to the attack
after a severe fight the two right brigades of van

toward tbe river braggs order had been fully obeyed but
the confederates exultant with success did not stop at the
hill hut pur sued the brc4cen union fragments and as
they neared the river a few of them crossed it

camuak stones standing or stone circles are found in numbers
throughout great britain to a less extent in norway and
sweden and a few in france and northern india the
typical atone circle of scotland england and ireland consists of
rou un ci reles vary in size from a diameter
of 20 feet to more than 100 feet and are
composed of stones of heights ranging from less than six
feet to 19 feet and of varying thicknesses the stones
are set up at distances of from five feet to
six yards apart and the site of the circle is
usually a level plain although the gentle slope of a
hill has sometimes been used the stones used are often
in the form google stones stahdino of huge loafshaped bonlders
set up on end ampad wedged in with smaller rocks
at ihdr bases sometimes the standing stones are set into
a shght excavation in the soil id a nuni ber
of the stone circles found in scotland the space between
two of the upright pillars usu ally die two at
the southwest side of the circle is filled by a
large flat rock set up on edge and extending from
pillar to pillar the loca tion of this distinguishing feature
at the south west seems coincident with the general plan
of structure and location of the supposed altar stone in
the structure of stonehenge qv some of the stone circles
contain a second smaller circle within them which circle is
often oomsed of etlties larger than those in the otttsfdo
circle and some of the examples show a ditch around
the drcle of pillar stones or else an earth wall
in either case whether it is ditch or wall the
entrance over or through it is invariablr to the northeast
the ditches are in some instances as wide as 30
feet with a depth of six feet the walls rarely
exceed five or six feet in height and the en
trances over the ditches are usually half as wide as
the ditch proper in one notable in stance that of
a small circle of large stones near the great circle
of stennis in orkney scotland both the ditch and the
rampart occur the latter within the former and the entire
interior area of the circle is raised about three feet
higher than the surrounding level same territory and in algeria
syria and north em arabia continuous circles of smaller stones
bedded in the ground or resting on the surface explorations
of the interior area of these cir cles has established
the fact that they were used for btirying grounds and
from the nature of the contents the burial urns and
the imple ments found beside the graves sir john lub
bock has concluded that they belong to the bronze age
see stonehenge but it is to the circles of standing
stones that the chief interest attaches and while it has
never been proven that these areas were intended for burying
grounds there seems to be sufficient reason for belief that
they were connected with the burial rites of the people
who erected them this theory is borne out by the
presence of burial mounds or barrows known as cairns in
scotland and ireland in close proximity to all the larger
circles indeed in some cases the cairns were surrounded by
the circle of stones as is seen in the great
chambered caim of new grange in ireland and in the
smaller ones of clava near inverness althottgh it is more
often the case the contents of the cairna particularly of
the larg ones do not always show interments of the
bronze age in this latter case there is no incinerary
urn contain ing the deposits or over them and the
remains show that there has been no cremation in like
manner many of the stone circles indeed the great majority
of them show no evidence lof toolwork is their building
while the im posts of the outer circle and outer
ellipse of stonehenge give conclusive proof of it as a
rule the cairns which covered the cre mation interments of
the bronze age are smaller than those of the preceding
period and the custom of placing the burnt bones in
a cavity in the soil covered only by an in
verted nm of clay dispensed wiui ue caim altogether ile
it retained the drcle of stand ing stones as a
visible mark or fence of the grave ground in about
20 instances in whidi there has been systematic excavation of
stone drcles in scotland the examination of the interior space
has disclosed burials of the bronze age mostly after cremation
but occa sionally unbumt the cremated remains were deposited with
dnerary urns placed either in an mverted position over the
burnt bones or upright and containing the burnt bones at
the bottom of a shallow pit excavated in the sub
soil these cinerary urns exhibit the forms and ornamentation cuaracteristic
of the age of bronze sometimes the burials have been
placed in dsts of unhewn slabs of stone cov ered
by small cairns of loose stones under neath the surface
level at other times the burnt bones of many burials
have been found placed in shallow cavities excavated in the
soil of the interior area of the drcte near the
bases of the upright stones it seems from these circumstances
that the common variety of stone drcles as found in
scotland are ceme teries of the bronze age and while
on the one hand die difference in the size of
the drdei of avebnry and stennis and in the structure
and size of stonehenge may point to a difference in
purpose and use on the other hand the great size
of the drcle sur rounding the chambered calm at new
grange and the objects unoovered by the repair ex cavations
at stonehenge in 1901 seem to show that a great
drcle also was assodated with a sepulchre the largest of
the scotch stone drcles is that of stennis in orkney
it has a drcum ference of 340 feel endoung an
area of ttro and onehalf acres and is surrounded by
a ditdi 30 feet wide it originally consisted of about
60 pillars set dgtout 17 feet apart of an aver
age height of about 13 feet of these 13 still
stand and 10 though prostrate are intacl the largest stone
drcle in england is that of ave bury in wiltshire
which consisted of a large ooter drcle of probably 1000
stones of from 15 to 17 feet in height and
40 feet in drcum ference this drde was about 1000
feet in diameter and contained two smaller drdes of 350
and 325 feet in diameter respectivdy the iimer drcles each
consisted of a double row of atones a stone pillar
20 feet high occupied the ceture of one and a
bowingstone or crotn icdi that of the other surrounding the
whole were a broad ditch and a high earthwall traversed
by an avenue of approach which led tawarltl the southeast

of the theories he had already advocated in the seven

had sought to do for architecture what he had already
achieved for paintiuk in his uodern painters qv to instil

of eardien ware see cerautcs which is impervious to water
and nonabsorbent almost nonporous the whole substance of the paste
being very siliciotis either from the original nature of the
clay or from a mixture with the day of some
natural silex such as flint a simple test is that
a broken fraginent if put to die tongue will not
seem to djng to its surface whereas a broken flowerpot
will cling tenadously this being caused by the rapid absorption
of moist ure by the porous substance it is for
this reason that stoneware is used for add contain ers
bottles vinegar jugs and all sudi cotnmon purposes and also
for larger and more deco rative vessels in countries and
in times where it is customary to use earthenware vessels
in stead of glass or metal at least to a
great ex tent thus in the rhine towns and north
western germany during the 14 and follow ing centuries a
very elaborate series of cans jugs and flagons of all
sizes from a fnnt to three or four gallons were
made and decorated simple impressions from metal or wooden ei
impressed upon the surface before firing the pattern bdn afterward
more or less em phasized by a thin glaring of
blue applied in parts the glaie of stoneware in the
usual sense is no more a separate substance than that
of greek vases it is a mere modifying of the
surface generally by some vaporized ingredi ent which is absorbed
during the actual process of firing thus the most common
glaze called saltglaze is generally understood to be pro duced
by throwing into the furnace rough salt which is vaporized
and leaves the soda in its composition on the surface
of the stoneware in the form of a slight glassy
film the stone ware would not need this to be
sufficiently re sistant against water wine at the like but
some ad would attack the stoneware against whidi the glaze
is a sufficient protection these decorative wares have been known
to the collectors and in museums and in treatises on
ceramics under the general name of gr de plandre as
if they were of ihemlsh make but this term is
now replaced by such terms as cologne ware cierman stoneware
and the like in modem times stoneware has not been
gen erally used for decorative purposes but recent experiments in
the national nwnufactory of porcelain at sevres in fiance have
led to the invention or adoption of many brilliant colored
enamels which can be applied to stoneware wui ont in
the least diminishing its value as a dur able and
weadictpnoof material and in this way a whole dass of
architectural ceramic wares has been made pncitcabte magtttampcent specimens of
these wares even to the extent of huge friezes containing
many figures were on exhibition at paris in 1900 and

during the revolutionary war by the british in 1779 the
americans had begun to fortify the place but were forced
10 abandon it by the british nnder clinton who then
completed the fortifications the only land approach was across a
marsh which was covered by water at high tide and
was defended by a double line of abattis and picket

the british were thoroughly aroused and opened fire upon both
columns the americana did not fire but charged with the
bayonet so impetuously that the enemy were uickly driven from

to surrender the two american columns reached ihe fort almost

preceding extractions stovbs and hbating appara tus any system of
heatink must necessarily include three things the combustion of fuel
in a fireplace stove furnace sleam or hotwater boiler a
system by which the heat is trans mitted to its
destination wia the least ssible toss and a system of
diftusion hj wtaidi the beat is conveyed to the air
in a room and to its walls floors ceilings etc
the simplest and most economical method of heating to instal
is the stove which requires no system of trans mission
but by radiation and convection ef fuses the heat directly
to the air and to the objects in the room
though this method has not been entirely superseded in dwellings
by tie hotair furnace owing to the cost of in
stalling the latter the furnace has largely done away with
use of the stove solely as an ap paratus for
beating purposes beside which the furnace has many advantages over
the stove as such the hotair furnace is generally con
structed of brick or iron plates and provided with a
bricklined firepot there is a combustion chamber over the fire
and between these latter two and the outside casing is
left a space for the circulation of air throu a
box or pipe called the coldair box located at the
bottom of the casing fresh air is brought from outside
enters the space between the casing and the firebox passes
over the heated surface of the fireppi and combustion chamber
and by means of pipes at the top of the
casing which connect with the registers is transmitted to the
various rooms of the house the furnace in its turn
was followed by the steam boiler whidi transmits the steam
to radiators throughout the house and from them the heat
is ditiused to the air in the room this method
of heatii has come into use largely as the office
buildii has been increased in size and the majority of
such buildings are now heated by steam gas and oil
stoves have also become valuable as means of heating isolated
rooms in a building or house not other wise connected
with any heating appliances stovea in 1490 the first stove
was reported as being made in alsace and in 1509
others were cast in islenberg the first blast furpace erected
in this country at lynn mass in 1642 turned out
a small roundbottomed kettle with a cover probably the first
stove of any descrip tion made in this country the
industry lagged for nearly a century and it was not
till the middle of the 18th century that the mannfac
ture was pushed to any great extent about 1735 qtristopber
sower of germantown pa began to manufacture the jambstove which
was the first attempt to heat other rooms than the
one iiwhich the great brick fireplace was place one end
opening in the adjoining room the other being heated by
the fire so that when the door of the jambstove
was opened a small amount of heal was transmitted to
the room in 1744 the manufacture of franklin stoves was
commenced in philadelohia this stovamp 1 of benjamin franklin consisted
in open fireplace jutting out fmn tbe chimney and thus
the heat was thrown ottt from three sides into the
room instead of lthiy the one side as in the
jambstove be tween 1752 and 1760 the sixplate or boxstove
which was the pioneer of the many modem forms of
heating apparatus was made in marl boro va stoves were
made in 1760 by baron steigel of lelitz pa and
in 1786 boxstoves were made in philadelphia but were not
put together there that work bdng done at provi dence
r i and troyn y whither the plates were shipped
in 1802 isaac orr began the manufacture of the cylindrical
or oval stoves of sheet iron at philadelphia and in
new hampshire this was the forerunner of the ovat regulator
stove having a firedamper anto matically opened and dosed by
the difference in expansions of a brats rod and the
sheet iron stovebody in 1820 die conant stove was made
at brandon vt and the woolson stove soon followed being
first made at bran don but they were later manufactnred
in massachusetts qeveland and detroit in 1836 a stove having
an illuminated case of cast iron end mica enclosed fines
a checkflue and a direct draft damper was maile by
james at water of new york and almost simultaneousb the
stanley square heatingstove was brought out the cylinderstove invented by
dr busb nell in 1845 except for the fact that
it was cylindrical and the inside was lined with fire
clay was similar to the stanley stove the latter having
return and exit flues enclosed in the four comers whereas
the former had a pipe at the back through which
the heat made its exit after having come down the
four pipes or floes in the cottier to the hollow
base the next in succession was the round or oval
gas burner or surface burner made of sheet iron and
having the flues which returned the beat to the base
enclosed in the body of the slove it should be
understood that these gasburn ing stoves consumed coal tbe reason
for the name gasburning being that they were as sumed
to consume all the gas emitted by the coal in
these gashbumers also the coal was more thoroughly burned out
by having perfo rated firepots andperforaiedgasringsat oie top of the
brick fuller warner and comnany of troy n y made
tne style of oval and round parlar stoves most generally
used the p p stewart the tasebumer has been in
use for many years one of the first to be
constructed being the selffeeder patented by jordan i molt sr
of new yort in 1833 the plan of his slove
being to feed the coal froio a magaiine to the
firebox and to use the chestnut size of anthracite coal
this was followed in 1852 by tbe selffeeding basebumins stove
and in 1862 by the morning glory both of which
were the inventions of d g littlefield of al bany
n y then came the american of van wormer amp
mcgarvey of albany n y and in 1863 tbe revert
ible hue gasburner with the magaiine attachment the productwn of
halles and treadwell in albany since then there have been
innumerable styles of stoves introduced with many more or less
valuable changes and additions the following are the most important

fluted fire pot steel dntni and airtit fitting in the
cooking stove there has been as much change as in
the stove used for purely heating purposes the pioneer in
this line was me james stove a nineplate with the
oven on the side of the stove the next in
succession was the conatit stove invented in 1819 which had
the oven directly over the firepot anti doors at both
ends but as the hre imdemeath the oven bested the
bottom too quickly this style was soon abandoned the woolson
stove of claremont n h hav ing the oven at
the side the heat being thrown under or over it
by means of dampers was next on the market but
as the fire caused the oven to bake more rapidly
on the near side the oven was next placed at
the rear and above the boilerholes in 1833 stanley invented
the rotary took stove with the cook ing holes and
firebox on the same level as the ovetl the next
step along progressive hnes came in 1810 in shape of
an oval stove the invention of a mr htttie of
salis buiy comi in which the fire having gone down
the two end flues and met at the bottom passed
to the chimney through an aperture in the hearth of
the firlace over which the stove was situated p p
stewart patented two stoves one in 182s the other in
1850 in the firat of which the firebox was hung
in the upper part of the oven thus throwing off
heat from three sides while the flame passed all arotmd
the oven on the oiuside and on ihe pipe collar
on top of the stove the latter the large oven
stove had a sheet due under neath with three flues
at the rear at about the same time 1850 the
curved filate which dimiped the ashes from the grate into
the pit in die hearth was invented by samuel pierce
and since then onl minor changes have been boade in
construction the watertanks reser voirs ates etc being rearranged various
methods of open ventilation returnflue con struction and different styles
of ornamentation being introduced the improved kitchen cooldng stove when
of large size was named range a sheetiron range in
which the grate containing the fire was mspended inside a
sheetiron casing the heat thus coming from the fire direct
was placed on the market in boston in 1850 by
a frenchman named gillette about the same time a similar
range was made in new york by duparquet huot and
uoneuse but they later made a radical change in the
construction by placing flues around the oven as at present
and the oven was made a separate part of the
construction these two were followed in 1885 by the wroughtiron
range of john van of cincinnati but with the many
rapid advances made in the manufacture of steel the use
of wrought iron has largely given place to the use
of blue polished steel and altmiinum painted steel the manufacture
of stoves is largely car ried on in the west
ohio illinois and michi gan being the latest producers the
earliest factories in the east where stoves were made exclusively
were at troy albany and new york the west tfien
began to loom ihe first foundry being established in detroit
about 1830 known as the hydraulic iron works which was
followed by dwyer and brother in 1861 this firm later
became the detroit stove walks which in 1871 was followed
by the michigan siove company and in 1881 by the
peninsula stove company and others the competition thus engendered between
western and eastern manufacturers soon led to the es tablishment
of branch foundries by the eastern people in western cities
and chico became the centre of distribution later ohio took
the lead and in 1915 onefifth of the production of
stoves and furnaces was in that state the statistics of
the trade are meagre but for the year 1900 the
output of stoves was valued at 35446600 distributed through the
slates as fouows pennsylvania s5209000 utichigan 4935000 new york k913700
ohio s4 200 illinois 3801000 massachusetts 2061 wisconsin 972000 thereafter
the census placed together the manufacturers of stoves furnaces and
gas and oil stoves and the total annual value of
the products is over 75000000 oil and ou stovn oil
stoves for do mestic use became common about 1875 the
earlier types were sinqily large tamps burning kerosene and having
a fixture on top for sup porting a pan kettle
or cooking or heating utensil very broad wicks were employed
and a circular burner and wick were also intro duced
that gave good results these oil lamps or oil stoves
had to be kept very clean to secure good combustim
as they delivered a great deal of carbon which tended
to clog the mechanism it was a decided improvement when
the vapor burning stove was later introduced in this the
naphtha or other light product of pe troleum was stored
in a small metal tank and led through a pipe
to one or more burners usually a set of burners
arranged like the lop of a stove the aperture to
the burner was very small and the slight stream of
naphtha that flowed was easily vaporiied so that after a
burner had been lit a minute or less it ceased
to bum oil directly as the pipe near the burner
became hot enough to vaporize the oil and delivered vapor
to the burner this vapor could be mixed with air
on the principle of a bunsen burner and thus the
consumption of fuel was hoth economical and safe for the
tank was at a distance from the flame oil stoves
of a variety of types utilizing the prin ciples here
described are on the market and d google stovb8 and
hxating apparatus are not only an economical method of heatins
bill very convenient as to portabiiity they have the disadvantage
however of rapidly consuming the oxygen in a small room
and constant ventilation is required to render the air lit
to breathe gas stoves have been made and used for
a long time but were never popular until after the
general atation for lowerpriced as had resulted in bringing ordinary
illuminating gas resulted in bringing illuminating gas to a price
below jl50 per 1000 cubic feet an exception region of
the middle west where they first came into common use
in the 60s and 70s about 1890 the gas companies
of the united states began a concerted effort to introduce
gas stoves to increase the sale of their com modity
the common type of heating stove atfered was of the
radiator type with a row of burners in the base
and large metal tubes directing the heat toward the top
so as to afford plenty of radiating surface these were
made of sheet iron usually ornamented with nickel in various
sizes and they have become common for household use where
rooms are not heated by furnace or steam for cooking
purposes the gas companies have supplied gas ranges patterned after
the coal ranges on top and as to oven conveniences
rosette burners are placed where the holes are in a
coal range and mixers employed to admit air to the
burners so as to secure hot blue flames with a
minimum consumption of gas these gas ranges have become very
popular with housewives for the save the dirt and dust
of coal and ashes involve cost only when in actual
use and are easily lit and turned out they are
often used in summer time along side coal ranges which
are allowed to tie idle the reason bcmg that the
gas range crrates less heat in the room and is
therefore more com fortable despite the fact that gas fuel
gen erally costs considerably more than coal the conveniences of
the gas stove and gas range have resulted in a
steadily increasing use pomacea the first hotair furnace for supplying
pure heated air to rooms was pmb ably that constructed
by franklin in 1744 this was a sheetiron obking box
burning wood the smoke passing into the chimney over the
top of the fiat chamber behind the fire and between
it and the real back of the stove the cool
air entered this flat hollon chamber throu a pipe and
when heated passed through small noles in the side of
the chamber mto the room this style of ap eatus
was not much improved upon till the inning of the
19th century when in 1803 daniel peitibone of philadelphia took
out a iteut on a stove for rarifying air by
heat his was followed by the warmr furnace of william
a wheeler of worcester mass 1835 by that of gurdon
fox of hartford conn 183sw the blaney and the culver
the boynton made bv richardson and boynton the thatcher and
others the rediurtion of the price of furnaces has made
their use more com mon till now nearly every large
dwelling house has one furnaces may be divided into two
general types the direct and indirect draft the better class
of direct draft furnaces have a radiator generally placed in
the top through which the gases pass before reaching the
smoke spc aikl usually have but one danpcr com ned
with the coldair check in the cheaper styles of directdraft
furnaces this radiator is heat that is utilized by the
better grade of fur nace in the indirect draft type
of furnaces the radiator is located near the base and
the gases pass down through flues to it thence up
ward and through another flue to the pipe this style
of furnace has a directdraft damper in addition to the
tlamper in the pipe thus allowing the gas to escape
to the chimney more ttie matter of grates and fircpots
is most important the most approved form of grate is
the revolving triangular pattern consisting of teethed triangular bars connected
by gears and turned by means of a detached lever
fire pots are nsiiallv made of cast iron or of
steel plate lined with firebrick the pot ranging in depth
from 12 to 18 inches in a wrouftiron or steel
furnace this firebrick lining is neces sary because the intense
heat may harm the out side shell but it has
not the advantage of giv ing oamp heat when the
coal is first put on as does the furnace having
the castiroti firepot tlie combustion chamber or space above the
firepot should be of sufficient size to allow the ses
to become thoroughly mixed with the air passing up through
the fire or through the openings of the feed door
the radiator generallv constructed of cast iron or steel plate
is used as sort of a reservoir for the ses
and air pasang over the furnace till the air has
extracted a considerable portion of the heat from the gas
the coldair box should be large enough to supply a
volume of air suffi cient to fill all the hotair
pipes at the same time the general size or area
of the coldair box bein threefourths the combined area of
the hotair pipes steam and hot water heating by means
of hot water has been in use since time imme
morial and was known prior to the christian era for
seneca mentions the methods by which water was heated in
the lliermk at rome thai of passing water through a
coil of brass pipes which passed throu a fire this
method was used in france in 1777 by m bonnemain
and in london in 1817 by marquis de chatan nes
for heating a conservatory and in 18 an englishman named
bacon introduced the method of using an inclined pipe of
large di mensions but this was not successful because of
imperfect circulation the first hotwater apparatus introduced in this county
was the perkins system introduced from ejigland by joseph nason
in 1s42 hotwater heating in the united states has been
an evolution since 18s0 the most popular heaters at the
beginning of this period being the gnmey and the h
b smith in 1885 the bolton heater was intro duced
by the detroit heating and lifting company the mouat heater
was the next in succession and since that time the
improve ments have been so many and the demand so
great that the price of the hotwater plant has been
reduced till it is within the readi of the average
householder hotwalf heating is pre ferred by some to steam
because the heat is available as soon as the temperature
of the water is higher than that of the room
whereas d google steam yiemt no beat nntu 2i2 aegteet
is passed and steam generates fillii the pipes but in
large installations steam is cheaper and has other advantages the
practice of heating buildings by leara was begon about 1845
the first bnildii to be so heated beina the eastern
hotel of boston and ihe first actory building the burlington
vl woolen mill the system by which uiese building weie
heated was introduced by joseph nason and consisted of small
wrought iron pipes fnun this small beginning have developed the
many intricate ystems of appa ratus now used for wanning
buildings there are two systems of heating by steunlt the
direct and the indirect the former being used in alt
classes of buildings both by itself and in combination with
other systems the direct system consists of a furnace and
boiler for the combustion of fuel and the generation of
steam a system of pipes by means of which the
steam is conveyed from the boiler lo the radiators and
the condensed water re turned to the boiler and the
radiators or coils of pipes placed throughout the rooms of
a building for the purpose of diffnung the heat lo
the air the types of boilers used are many and
various the castirtm sectional boiler is more commonly used for
dwellinghouses and the tubular or watertube boiler for larger buildings
id the boiler used for heating pur poses only it
is not necessary to carry a press ure of more
than two to 10 poimds the con densation flowing back
to the boiler by gravity when under a hi pressure
the steam for the heating system is forced through a
reducing valve ana the condensation returned to the boiler by
means of a pump or return trap the system of
diffusing the heat by radiators is not standard no particular
one being of greater benefit than another there are the
common castiron sectional radiator the vertical wroughttron pipes screwed into
a castiron base the castiron wall radiator which does not
obstruct the flow and the coils of iron eipes placed
along the ceiling or walls these itter being of late
years ornamented and fre quently gilded inairect steam heating has
the advantages both of the furnace and of the direct
steam but the cost of installing the system is greater
the main difference between the two lies in the radiator
in ihe indirect system a special form of heater being
placed beneath the floor and encased in galvanized iron or
brick work connected with the space beneath the heater is
a coldair box and warmair pipes at the top arc
connected with registers in the floors or walls as previously
described for furnaces so that the air in passing through
the spaces between the sections of the heater becomes warmed
and rises to the rooms above as compared with furnace
healing this method has one great advantage being less affected
by outside wind pressure as long runs of horizontal pipe
are avoided and the heaters can be placed near registers

strangulation violent constricuon of the neck involving such compression of
the windpipe as to close the airpassages prevent respiration and
finally cause death in hang ing which sometimes produces strangulation
if much violence is used death may be caused qf
direct injury to the upper part of the spinal cord
gv from fracture or dislocation of the cervical vertebra or
by syncope from shock in such cases death must be
almost instantaneous if the constriction is so applied as to
compress the great vessels in the neck and not the
wind pipe death is due to coma and is somewhat
slower than in cases of asphyxia if both ves sels
and windpipe arc compressed coma and asphyxia may both contribute
to cause death when suspension of the body has not
contin ued for much more than five minutes and the
parts about the neck have not suffered violence there is
a probability that resuscitation may be established though many cases
are recorded when after only a few minutes suspension it
has been found impossible to restore life moreover if a
person who has hanged himself has been cut down sufficiently
soon to allow of the respiratory process being restored he
is by no means safe death often taking place from
secondary effects it is believed that uncon scionsnesscomeson very rapidly
and death takes place without causing any suffering the violent
convulsions that are so often observed being milar to those
which occur in epilepsy ex posure to a free current

applicatioi to the nostrils ampt inbstud poblaees to ttm chest

the subsequent abstfacdon of blood if there should be much
cerebral congestion are good measures for the treatment of partial
strangulation they should be used if natural breathing is not
at once resumed from the postmortem appear ances togedier with
circumstantial evidence the medical practitioner is not uofrequently called upon
to answer such medicotcgal ques tions as was death caused
by hanging or was the body suspended after death was
the strangulation the result of accident homicide or suicide in
case of strangulation frcon other causes than that of hanging
the postmortem sjrmptoms are similar but the iajury done to
the parts about the neck is comrooniy greater in manual
strangulation the eitcroal marks of in jury will be in
front of the neck about and be low the larynx

the science of directing whh pnunptitnde precision and clearness masses
of troops to gain possession of points of import ance
in military operations its object is to so direct these
masses that upon reaching any designated point the army shall
have a better ksition than that held by the enemy
or shall ve such a position as will force him
to change his position or shall be superior to him
in num bers or shall have some decided advantage over
the enemy in case of a conflict in general it
may be divided into peace and war stratesy and the
latter can be subdivided into that in e area of
hostilities and that at home comprising the mobilization etc of
imits and resources to support the forces at the front
there arc two main principles which guide all warfare whether
on land or sea and these are concen tration and
the initiative concentration con sists in so disposing the forces
that they may be superior to the enemy at the
critical point and moment a belligerent secures the tnitto iwe
when he compels the enemy to conform 10 1 movements
to accept battle on his own terms and that means
when his concentration is cotneted the value of the initiative
i that it enables the belligerent securing it to take
advantage of concentration and liraitgy is the ait by which
a belligerent brings about this condition of affairs the initiative
most not be confounded with the offensive they are not
sydohiymoua terms there is a close relationship between strat tty
and tsctks strbtegjy is in a peculiar sense the sdence
of generals m command of armies while tactics in all
its ramificauons from the elementary drill of the sltddier to
orders of battle fmen the bivouac of an outpost to
the encampment of an army now belongs to offi cers
of all grades yet with these marked dif google n
b sheti pedantry to pretend to do fine the precise
limits of these two prominent branches of the niilitarj art
as the present a multitude of exceptions in which they
approach and run into eadi other tactics if wc re
strict its meaning to the evolutions and manoeu vres of
troops on the field of battle may be taught with
mathematical exactness because every movement is accurately prescribed and the
more so the lower we descend the scale of this
branch of military knowledge bui this is far from beii
trtje of strategy becanse in ae calculations inv6lved in its
operations a great many consideraiions enter which do not admit
of exact computation and upon which success or failure essentially
depend as time the character of the roads over which
the army has to move the nature of the obstacles
which lie between it and the enemy the moral quali
ties and activity of the enetnys forces etc in s
mountainous country the strategical points although few in number are
generally very prominent the junction of several val 13 or
roads alon the crests of several ridges woiild naturally be
of great value to an army occupying it as the
forces might operate in a one of the valls or
along any of the roads with an equal facility while
the enemy once corimitted to one line couldnot change to
an dther without great labor and loss of time necessitated
by uie retrograde movement result ing from the diilicutty of
crossing the interven ing spurs or valleys in the eampaint
of 1796 97 in italy bonaparte by causing the redotibt
which dosed the pass of the montenotie to be occupied
by 1200 men was able to interpose his army between
the armies of the allies aus trians and sardinians and
whip them in de tail at this lime the allies
numbering about wpooo men were operatinr in three columns by
three roads separate by very difficult mountain ous country bonaparte
with about 30000 men holding the middle road the pass
of the uonte notte very successfully accomplished his plan of
attacking in succession the columns of the enemy the campaign
was thus decided from its inception and the redoubt of
iiontenotte seconded by a small and brave garrison had great
influence upon the final result the capi tal city of
a country is usually a very import aint strategical point
this may proceed not from its influence on the military
operations of a campaign or from its position but from
the fact uiat it is the seat of the government
the occupation of which by the enemy may have a
lasting and damaging effect in a political point of view
during the american civil war great importance was attached to
the capture of uk city of richmond and all the
campaigns of the army of the potomac were made with
that city as the objective point with the idea that
its fall would put an end to the war this
was undoubtedly too much to expect forthebulr wvk of the
rebellion wag not the dty of ricbgt mond but the
confederate armies and their capture or overwhelming defeat was necessary
before the fall of the city would be a decisive
cause of the dose of the war the suppliel and
reinforcements of the confederate armv were nearly all drawn from
the states south of virginia and as long as the
avenues of sup ply remained intact the cohcsijn of the
anny wu assured atul it lemained a menacing focce movements
in war whether offensive or de fensive must always be
based on calculation of time and distance in an offensive
war the operations bt vaster the cotrditions more vari able
and the elements of the calculation more tkncertain in a
military point of view the offensive has its good and
its bad side strafe cally an invasion leads to deep
lines of opera tion which are always dangerous in a
boatile country au the obstacles in die enemys country the
mountains rivers defiles and forts are favorable for defease while
the inhabitants and authorities of the counto so far from
being the instruments of the invading army are generally hostile
however if success be obtamed the cnsmv is struck in
a vital point he is deprived of hjs resources and
compelled to seek a speedy termination of the oontest for
a sitigle operation which we call taking die initiative the
offensive is almost always ad vantageous particularly in stratify indeed
if the art of war consists in throwing the masses
upon the decisive points to do this it will be
necessary to take the initiative the attacking party knows what
he is doing and what he desires to do he
leads his masses to the point where he desires to
strike tactically the offensive also possesses advantes but they are
less iiositive since the operations bein ipoa a limited field
the party taking the initiative cannot hide them from the
enemy who may detect his designs and by the aid
of good re serves cause them to fail whatever advan
tages may be expected either politically or strateeicaily from the
ofienaive it may not be possible to maintain it exchisively
throuout the war for a campaign offeflsive in the bo
ning may become defensive before it ends tlje offensive confer
at the outset the power of concentrating on the flank
or centre of the eneoiys line of defense and so
turning or breaung it the defender must either oppose the
enemy with an inferior force at first or abandon territory
in order to assemble his forces at some point further
back on the other hand oflensive war demands great re
sources and succsitf if not absolute and dcdsive entails fresh
difgculties on the invader and when he has penetrated very
far witiur the defenders territory the situations of tke antagonists
differ grcatly inasmuch as die anny on the offensive is
bound to its base be that base wttk or narrow
while the defensive forces may base themselves on aiy portion
of the territory which will sttpply them and irtiicii their
frost protects it is evident that wheo one belligerent power
feels secure behind an unassailable frontier and holds many issues
into the enemys territor either by command of the its
or otherwise it can assemble its forces unknown to its
antagonists upon some pamt selected by itself from whence to
make an eruption into tlie theatre of war and if
the belligerents be divided only by a fronliet line a
river such as the rhine or a mouotain range such
as the alps the army that passes it will nearly
always find itself immensely superior to the forces that can

be the dilef and deciding features of war this assertion
is not strictly true as armies have been destroyed by
strategic operations witboat dgt google t18 the occuttcncc of intcbcd
battles by a succes sion of inconsiderable asairs it is
also tmo that a conqiiete and decided ttctory may ktve
rise to resiills of the same character when there have
been no grand strategic combina tions the results of a
bmtle generally depend upon a union of causes which are
not always within the scope of the military art the
nature of the order of battle adopted the great or
less wisdom displayed in the plan of the battle as
well as the manner of earning out its de tails
the more or less loyal and enlightened co operation of
tbe officers subordinate to the corn man dergtincfaief the cause
of the contest the proportions and quality of the troops
their greater or less enthusiasm superiority on one side or
the other in artillery or cavalry and the manner of
handlinf these arms but it is the morale of armies
as well as of nations more than anythiw else which
makes victories and their results decisive when the march of
an army has been so conducted that when it meets
the enemy on the field of battle it has a
decided advantage over him the battle which follows will usually
be more decisive than in the contrary case a single
battle well fought un der the foregoing condition has frequently
been decisive of tbe whole campaign and even of the
war the battle of jena gave napoleon advantages which vigorously
followed up in the manner so peculiar to him soon
placed the kingdom of prussia at his feet and left
him free to turn his attention to the russians tactical
and strateecal consideration both enter into fte problem of determining
the point of attack the consideration which will govern in
any particular case will depend upon the re sults which
are expected to follow the defeat of the enemy or
the risks to be run in attain ing these results
the tactical considerations relate to tbe advantages which can be
gained on the field of battle and the strategical to
tbe consequences of victory the strategical back on the iibinssable
obstacle opposite the left flank a c with the right
reinforced it would be a better positicm for the assailed
to take as in this case an attack at a
would compel the assailant to fight with an obstacle at
his back and an attack at c would give tbe
assailed tbe full benefit of the height the position a
c is also objectionable as it presents a salient d
always a weak point in a line because it renders
both faces liable to be enfiladed suppose an army acting
on the defensive to have the posi tion x y
fig 2 its right uncovered and its left restir on
an impassable obstacle the strategical point of attack is y
for if the left is forced track the line of
retreat a b a t posed but the selection of
y as the point of attack forces the assailant to
light with his back to the obstacle z which would
be very dangerous unless greatly superior to the enemy rather
x select as the point of attack and depend upon
vigorous figating and pursuit for conditions are more important than
the tactical unless the difficulties of the ground are too
great and the results expected to follow do not justify
the risks to be takea let the army p in
fig 1 find the enemy in the position a b
wisi one eank resting on a hill and the other
on a river with an impossible marsh in front the
point a is both trie strategical and tactical point of
attack for its capture would command the field of battle
force the enemy from his line of retreat x y
and throw bim great results combined attacks like combined marches
cannot be relied upon for success they should only be
undertaken when the natural features of the country are such
that the enemy can be easily checked if he attempts
to make a counterattack and when the prdimi nary movements
of the troops are concealed from his view when the
features of the coun try are such that the detachments
can by tak ing up naturally strong positions hold the
enemy in check flie main body can operate with safety
against the flank for in case of repulse its main
line of retreat would not be com promised much depends
upon the character of the opposing general if he be
alert and al ways ready to act promptly and vigorously
any extended movements would be dangerous al though it might
under other drctnnstancei be successfully carried out movements may be
made with troops that are superior in numbers or in
discipline which would be very rash when the opposing forces
are nearly equal or the commanders of the same capacity
a careful reconnaissance is important iu both tactical and strategical
operations a general reconnais sance has for its object the
obtaining of de tailed and accurate information of countries and
their armies that will be of assistance in case of
war it comprises within its scope ouc own as well
as other countries for the data obtained may be useful
in prosecuting military studies and as an aid to a

greatest contrilmtiod to the successful outcome of the european war
was the hotlycontested battle of the uense which resulted in
cutting the main arterv of the german supply system jp
to the tmddle of september 1918 the germans were able
to operate unmolested the sedanmeciires rail way running parallel to
the front and furnish ing 3 base of supply for
the whole line from pia 3 nhutntinsthevi much that might
be of great utility in planning military operations but it
enables officers to gain personal experience of peoples and their
customs which might be invaluatite to them and to their
country in the event of war speciai reconnaissances are made
with refers ence to the actnal military situation at the
time and a report of them is nsually made at
once frequently upon the spot they are known as topographical
and armed recomiaissances the latter being usiially termed a patrol
icout or force is generally made just before a battle
for the purpose of forcing the enemy to develop tiis
strength and dispositions the addition of infantry ves to recon
nmtering parties a strength and power of re astance which
cavalry can never attain by it self the employment of
artillery tends toward a similar end and the especial mobility
of horse artillery renders it most appropriate for sudi service
artillery is nevertheless seldom added to an ordinary reconnoitering party
its use being generally confined to a reconnaissance in force
or a special reconnaissance but although guns are not much
employed upon this kind of duty there may still be
occasions where artil lery would prove a useful addition to
the other valenciennes to meti to cut this supply line
at both ends and force withdrawal or capture on this
enttre front the british attacked in the north the first
few days of fitting yielded considerable gains fully conscious of
the gravity of the situation the enemy threw in division
after division of fresh troops and during the ensuing weeks
occurred the bitterest fighting in which american trmps took part
the second week of october practically all available units about
28 divisions were in the line progress could be made
only a few yards at a time but the continued
hammering finslly wore out the resistance of the enemy forces
and the american troops brake through day after day steady
gains were made up the west bank of the meuse
until on 7 november the united states forces entered the
outskirts of sedan and definitely cut the german supply line
a day later the french forces came up on the
left flank the meeting of frendi and american troops on
this historic spot dgnal iied the defeat of the german
arms a defeat as decisive and humiliating as that forced
upon france 47 years before at the same spot it

future no direct attack can possibly be laade on troops

european war was largely influ enced by the enormous frontages

of testing flanks on se cure obstacles when a line
is persistently and sufficiently battered a retirement becothes nec essary
this is depressing to the morale of the troops and
even in a voluntary retirement die losses in men and
materiel are unduly large therefore a retirement should be avoided
when possible and should be accom panied by a contraction
of the front either closing in on the centre leaving
two exposed flanks or to one side leaving one exposed
flank it would appear that whatever advantage ac crues from
shortening the front would accrue equally to both sides the
advantage of a short front ues in the fact that
it takes a greater preponderance of force to break a
front strongly held than one we ak l y held
further the oppor tunity for nianltxuvre is restricted by a
narrow front wellingtons withdrawal to the lines of torres vedras
is a dassical example of shortening front by retirement the
european war furnished one example of the successful shortening of
a line in the ailied withdrawal to the sajonila position
numerous wars have demoastrated tlie stratecal ptincides of concentrstion of
ef fort importance of fantiative value of sur prise and
necessity for unrelenting pressure on a beaten enemy and they
have been demon strated again in the european war but
op erations of detached forces against the enemjrs communications of
which there are many ex amples in former wars seldom
occurred in die late war such operations depend on rapid
and resolute execution and close cooperation between the divided forces
operations against communications are hardly practicable under modem war conditions
with tiie huge forces and continuous fronts involved general maude
used this method gainst the turks at kut el amara
but it was not used in the great the atres

forces the operations of the german sub artnes were aimed
at the british sea com munications the allies could not
get at the gertbbn fleet because of mine fields and
coast defenses and the submarines caused the ent ploymcnt of
considerable naval forces against them it is thus advanteous to
menace the enemys cofdmunica lions the european war may be
termed a war of pojitiom the french and german armies
alter marching toward one another came into collision the french
army led away by war like eulfausiasin threw itself without
protection gainst the cannon the machine guns and the trenches
of ibe german army and left thou sands of dead

it offered a superb resistance once more sacrilidng thousands of
lives then the german army retreated in its turn but
establted itself solidly on the aisne protected by previously prepared
trenches the french army dug in opposite each adversary finding
himself unable to dislod the other by direct assault tried
to outflank him thereupon began the famoas race to the

only an enormous supply of cannon munitions aiuf machines but
also factories capable of producing them railroads and highways suf

equipped to meet die needs of the army under all

which have suffident htraran reserves such as russia nor yet
for those like france and great britain which can draw
on their colonies on the other hand it is hijy

certain quarters to the word strategy its meaning may be
better sasped if illustrated rather than defined btslef a wellknown
english writer claims d by google 8tratbot that the theatre
of war is the province of strategy the field of
battle is the province of tactics clause witz considered that
tactics is the employment of troops for the object of
the fikht strategy is the adaptation of fikhting for the
object of the war derrecaix a french author observed that
the combinations of strategy are governed by imnititable prin ctples
while tactics includes operations which are subject to modification as
improvements are made in war material this however does not
furnish the whole truth as certain principles of tactics such
as concentration of force the valueof surpriscandof snperiorityof are are
as constant as those of strategy at die commencement of
the european war the word strategy at once attained high
popularity rout of bulgaria this was due to the reto
forcement of the allies by ventceloi new greek army though
this army was not used on the part of the
field where the chief rupture was effected contributitig causes were
the dete rioration of the morale of the bulgarian array

the great advances in aero nautics radiotelegraphy and ganncry it

for the enemy to attack when we are least prepared

while the word tactics was neglected strategy then soon came
to be the term applied to every operation of war

in french flanders became a strategical key point and it
has been stated on the highest authority that vimy ridge
which was captured in 1917 has proved to be a
feature of the highest strategic importance formerly tactical would have
been the adjective used in these descriptions now it is
strategical in the course of the european war 191418 there
developed many strategic mysteries the russian success in east prussia

defeat of the germans on the mame macken sens overwhelming

character ised by palmate trifoliate leaves prodticed upon vetv short
stems often less than an inch long and usually called

another european species p vtsca the alpine or perpetual strawberry

bearing have rendered it popular in private gardens for which
places it should be but is not very popular in

or common garden strawberry is the iwrenl of the vast
majority of horticultural varieties cultivated in america if not throudiout
the world this species was introduced into cultivation early in
the 18th century the first successful american variety the kovey
seedling was introduced in 1834 or 1835 up to which
time the european varieties hod tcllih been cultivated in gardens
but not tmtil 1854 when the wilson or wilsons albany
was intro duced can strawberry growing be said to have
gained a footing upon a commercial scale this firmfleshed largeberried
variety quickly proved itself adaptable to a great vane of
soils throughout the whole country and its wonder ful productiviw
led to its extensive planting the growth of the industry
has been so rapid and has reached such proportions that
one writer asserts that probably more strawberries are shipped into
new york in a day during the busyseason than appeared
in its markets dur niary or earlier the strawheny season
travels northward to canada where it closes in july and
during this season which lasts usually from two to three
weeks in a locality there are often trainloads of berries
sent to market each day in some of the more
important reions such as the coastal lain of north caro
lina the chesapeake peninsula and western new york the rate
often reaches a carload a day for each mile of
railroad through the ship ping district the berries are mostly
used as dessert but immense quantities are used for canning
and for roalang jams and jellies various beverages and fruit
syrups arc also made from them strawberries are propagated by
means of seeds division of the crown and by runners
new varieties are almost invariably grown from seeds no two
of which from the same fruit can be reasonably expected
to produce plants identical as to vigor productivity season of
maturity etc and among which if taken from ordinanly good
fruits the proportion of valua ble new varieties is probably
less than nt in lp000 with seeds produced by handpollina
tion of individual blossoms and under the most careful management
the proportion may be one in 1000 seedlings all or
almost all of the im proved varieties have been produced
in this way only a very few being obtained by
selection of individual plants though this method is really operative
more or less unconsciously in all plantations division of the
crown is very rarely practised with american varieties but fs
more common with european it consists fn cuttink the old
plants apart so as to have roots with earn part
after management is about the same as for runners very
few of the strawberry plants sown in america are grown
by other methods sn by runners which are produced freety
by most varieties and will become independent plants usually within
three or four weeks if covered with earth when rooted
they may be dug trimmed and planted care being taken
to place the crown level with the surface of the
ground sometimes they are rooted in pots for planting in
autumn in such cases they may be allowed to fruit
the following season and are usually alkiwed to bear two
crops before being turned under since they are more costly
and since he ground is generally cleaner by this method
of management than by the common one some times the
runners are dug in the spring planted closely in nursery
beds for a month during which the soil is thoroughly
worked to get rid of weeds and make it fine

it should be planted to corn or potatoes for at

rootfeeding insects a chance to escape otherwise ihey being deprived
of their natural food may injure the strawberry plants dur

be given and the ground made as free from weeds

the land may not need further prcpara usually however spring
pla 30 inches apart and the plants set by band
upon a large scale by transplanting machines during the first
season most growers destroy the blossoms because it is considered
that fruit bearing this season stunts the growth and im
pairs fruilfulness during the succeeding year since the plants are
low growing and unable to fight weeds and also produce
well clean cul tivation is essential throughout the growing period
after the fruiting season runners will appear often they come
earlier and should be allowed to root so as to
form a more or less continuous row which by the
end of the autumn should be about 18 inches wide
sotne growers who supply fancy markets or special customers grow
the plants in tills or stools the runners being destroyed
and the original plant encouraged to develop additional crowns as
soon as the ground freezes a mulch of marsh hay
straw pine needles or other material free from weed seeds
is spread liberally upon the plants to keep the frost
in the soil and prevent lieaving of the plants and
the consequent break age of the roots in the spring
this mulch is dther renvoved entirely from the reld or
is raked between the rows in the former case one
or two cultivations are usually given in the latter none
either at this time or during the previous summer or
at both times appli cations of commercial fertilizers may be

strawberries are occasionally forced in greenbouses to supply a small
demand among the wealthy the plants are usually grown in
pots because they can be better controlled than in benches
and because they may tgte sold for decorative purposes as
well as for dessert they are generally potted in early
spring and the nrst runners from them rooted in small
pots which when full of roots are discarded for taie
pots in which rtiese plants are to bear fnut the
pots are then kept in deep beds of ashes preferably
under a cold frame in which great care is ureaed

strawberries are seldom seriously injured by insects al thoimh a
considerable number are partial to this plant the larvs of
several rootfeeding beetles are sometimes troublesome if the gnower plants

be obviated by two or perhaps even one intervening crop
of pota toes or com there are also several beetles
which enjoy the blossoms tender foliage or fruits but since
these travel slowly they may be voided by selectii new
gnound each year there are a few general feeding insects
such as caterpillars plant bugs etc whidi occasion ally vary
their diet with strawberries but they are rarely troublesome several
socalled plant diseases have been reported as causing lasses in
platttations but very frequently the cause may be readily traced
to other sources sudi as t laming in unsuitable soil

the theory of stream lines is a part of the
mathematical sci ence of hydrokinetics the most important re sult
of this theory is known as the principle of bernoulh
darnel it asserts that in the steadv motion of liquids
or fluids of constant density the sum of the pressure
the kinedc energy per unit volume and the potential energy
per unit volutpe of the liquid is constant along a
stream line the principle holds also with a slight modification
of statement for the case of ses this principle accounts
for the fact that in the steady flow of liquids
through tubes of variable cross section the pressure is least
where the velocity of the liquid is greatest and vice

favored streams this is particularly true of those that are
located in areas of softer rocks where less energy is
required to erode such streams often extend their headwaters so

rivers and capture portions of their drainage the former stream

stnet road an open way or thoroughfare within the corporate
limits of a dty or town in the rural districts
streets are called roads or higwa very primitive cities seem
to have been built without real streets much after the
manner of indian villages but as population and the activities
of communities grew the ne cessity for better means of
communication within the towns themselves and between them and the
surrounding countiy arose and called into being the more regular
distribution of buildings in the large cities of precolumbian america
with a few notable exceptions the buildings seem to have
been grouped irregularly around a public square along the four
sides of which were paved roads from this square at
first exit was bad by one or two highways along
which were grouped buildings of many kinds this seems to
have been the only evidence of the regular pladng of
buildings in a town this constructive plan or rather lack
of plan is strongly in evidence in the ruins of
the cities of the early period of semimodem civilization in
yucatan in the ruined city of uxmal qv the central
plaia is occupied by a great flattop pyramid terraced in
form round which are grouped the other important building on
high pyramids or elevated terraces but without any evidence of
plan but in some of the later cities the pyratnid
is found surrounded by an open space consisting of the
outer edges of the central plaia from this plaza roads
led in various directions often for hundreds of miles into
the count these were efficiently paved and maintained at the
expense of the general evemment from the heart of the
dty of anial ted far into the interior four excel
lently paved roads over which the traffic was immense elach
of these roads started from one of the four comers
of the central plaza the broad groundlevel space of which
was hand somely mvcd with earefnlljcut large stone blocks from
the andent chiapan dty of pa lenque stretched a wellpaved
street for over a hundred miles into guatemala all along
this street intermittently were stone building the ruins of which
are still in evidence this was evidently a great highway
of commerce and general traffic especially to the sacred shrines

the organization of dtio and toni d google 8trbkt clkanihg

irregular in its street structure than the later as nations
began to extend thrir connnerce tnde and other relations they
generally im proved their roads and streets the construc tion
of the magnificent streets of the cities of the roman
empire seems to have been along the same line of
growth as that of the later civilized empires of america
two necessities compelled the building of magnificent highways commercial activity
and political require ments no one other factor gave more
effi ciency to the roman empire than its system of
magnificent roads these in their turn brought commerce trade commercial
import ance wealth and luxury to the greater cities all
these called for more sanitary modes of living and better
fadlities for moving about the cities and towns this brought
into being a more geometrical organization in many cities and
towns and the construction of magnificent wellpaved streets and avenues
many of which were lined with stone benches ahd handsome
statues the famous appian way known as the queen of
roads stretched away from the heart of the rome of
the empire for a dis tance of 350 miles every
mile of which dis played some feature worthy of attention
it was quite natural that such great roads lined with
magnificent palaces and other noteworthy edifices should have had their
effect upon the streets of the cities of the empire
but after the fall of borne the art of dty
street construction declined throughout europe under germanic and gothic influence
new dties and towns were constructed with narrow crooked unsanitary
streets many of them little s were paved at all
it was generally with loose cobblestones and later with routty
cut stones in the more progressive dties the old roman
art of building cement ways seems to have been completely
lost forgotten or neg lected here am the old story
has repeated itself the rapid extension of trade and com
merce during the i9th century the invention of the steam
engine the locomotive and the steam boat called for the
extension of highways and the material improvement of those already
ex isting these in turn brought increased popu lation and
wealth and importance to the cities and towns in their
train came the improve ment of the city streets the
invention of the bicycle and the automobile led about the
be ginning of the present century to the rapid extension

the place of the oldfashioned narrow walks of a gener
ation ago even in the united states the board walks

the tendency now is more and more to turn over

and beautifying and it is safe to say that the

and light waste when deposited by the house holder in

these functions the removal of dead ani mals and household

after the melting of winter snows and an autunin cleaning
after the fall of the leaves the routine work of
street sweeping and the removal of household waste is performed
by men regularly emplod by the department while work which
vanes much with the season such as the removal of
dead animals street sprinkling and the disposal of snow is
in most cities let to contractors who are subject to
the call of the department but are better able to
supply the sudden demands for men and teams at any
point for a long time in europe and of late
in america the men of the departments of street cleaning
have been protected in their employ ment by civil service
rules which insure their positions during eflidency and good conduct
and in europe they receive pay during sickness and pensions
on retirement this has had the effect of providing a
clasi of men tuiied to dgt google tsb stbxbt clbaning
the work and contented with their positions and in raising
the morale of the departments in europe the men sometimes
wear distinctive caps or some other badfe of employment and
in some cities they wear a modest uniform in new
york city the sweepers are garbed in white because this
is most conspicuous on a crowded street and conduces most
to the safety white must be thoroughly washed and alwavs
in good sanitary condition in many of the older and
larger cities of europe vienna for example where strict obedience
to law has long been rigidly enforced each house holder
keeps his portion of the sidewalk uni formly and always
clean having it sprinkled and swept twice daily in summer
and kept clean in winter while in new york few
house holders regard it as a duty and a point
of honor to keep their individual sidewalks clean in sum
mer and free from snow and ice in winter in
new york it is very cmnmon to see a news
paper dropped on the street with no protest whereas in
europe such an act would almost certainly cause a mans
arrest if he refused to ick up the paper there
are streets in new ork where one sweeper keeps clean
20000 square yards of pavement there are other streets in
the crowded districts where one mans work is to keep
clean 1000 square yards in the latter case the pavement
is labonously swept seven times daily the late street commissioner

to the difficulty and ecpensc of sweeping aa the action
of careless and thoughtless per sons in making the igtublic

rid and which a little consideration would induce them to

cart without the trouble of sweeping and shoveling from the
pavement machine sweepers horse or automobile lessen the cost ot
street cleaning and may be used to advantage with preliminary
sprinkling on wide level wellpaved streets between mid night and
dawn but their service on crowded streets in daytime is
impracucablc a fall of snow is such an impediment to
city traffic which is usually conducted on wheels even in
winter thai it is rccogmzed as a duty of the
departments of street cleaning to remove it promptly from important
streets especially from the lines of daily food distribu tion
and from the avenues of daily approach to the business
districts the numbers of men and teams suddenly required are
very large and dumping facilities are in general quite inade
quate to the work the cost is also great about
125 per mile of street per inch of snow or
1250 per mile of street for a 10inch fall for
these reasons numerous effoi have becd made to develop practical
processes for melting the snow as it lies or at
least n the block where it lies and running the
water into the nearest sewer opening machines for the pur
pose have been tried in many cities for many years
but have usually proved unequal to the task because of
the cost of melting the most satisfactory method where there
is plenty of water in the city pipes that is
well above the freezing point is to turn a hydrant
hose on the snow and wash it down the gutters
of course this method is applicable only to a light
fall or to the remnant of a heavy snow fall
in known numbers and when tlie dirl is dry and
dust is raised by passing trafec or by winds the
dust and the germs find lodgment in eyes nostrils and
mouths and the work of disease is begun of course
the dust and the germs are the thicker the nearer
the pavement and no other cause is necessary to explain
why the children of the crowded streets are so affected
careful experiments carried out in new york by commissioner woodbury
with germ cul tures from plates exposed some at the
curb level and some at six feet above exhibited a
wonderful diberence in tlie number of germs which found lodgment
on the plates in differ enc parts of the city
at the curb level the evi dence of the plates
showed on the average five times as many crms as
at six feet above in a tenement district densely populated
where push and tranic heavy as many diameter in another
part of the city residential district with heavy traffic but
well flushed pavement only 54 colonies were found after a
15minute exposure the relative costs of street cleaning in dif
ferent cities of the world are impossible of comparison because
the conditions and the standards of cleanliness vary so much
and be cause the work of the department has nowhere
been reduced to an exact science bui in gen eral
the cost in europe is much less than in america
because of the greater waste and care lessness of the
average american citizen and because of the lower wae cost

surfaces and not concentrated at points as in the mechanics

use is con fusing as well as superfluous if the
stress is normal perpendicular to the surface on which it
acts it is called normal or tensile or com pressive
stress if tangential it is called sktar ttie deformation resulting
from the application of force may be manifested as a
change of length of area or cross section of volume
or of angle the change of length or area or
volume per unit length or area or volume is called
linear or areal or volumetric strain strains are purely numerical

of stress without having some other kind present furthermore it

is the ultimate cause of failure the precise meaning of
the word strength is not fuilv understood that is we

elastic properties and strength depend on the shape and size
of the lest specimen for several reasons local stresses due
to clamps and grips have greater disturbing effects on small

layer which like tlie capillary film on liquids has properties
differenl from those within the material blowholes minute cracks and
par ticles of foreign substance are relatively larger in smaller
specimens stress lends to concen trate itself at comers edges
abrupt changes in section and internal cavities so that in
a test piece having such peculiarities it is difficult to
learn what stress really acts the planes or surfaces of
separation between the molecular crystal groups which are known to
exist in even the most homogeneous metals are oriented differently
throughout the mass as a result of which two specimens
cut frtgtm the same body show somewhat different properties this
differences which have been observed between the strengths of long

due largely to lack of homogeneity gtaplin in van noslrands

comparative results at best the american society for testing materials
accordingly specifies a piece about 18 inches long and two
inches in diameter the middle nine inches being turned to
a diameter of one and a half inches and the
three cylinders thus formed running smoothly without shoulders into one
another the british standards committee recommends a cylindrical bar of
a length equal to nine times its diameter ex tension

stricture a morbid contraction of a mucous canal or duct
of the body as the urethra cesophagus or intestjoe when
the affected pan is not mentioned and a person is
stated to suffer from stricture it b always the urethral
canal that is referred to contraction of this canal may
be either permanent or transitory the first form is due
to a thickening of the walls of the urethra in
consequence oforganic deposits and is hence termed organic stricture the
second may be due either to local inflam mation or
congestion or to abnormal muscular action the first of these
varieties being inflam matory or congestive stricture and the second
spasmodic stricture of which the last named seldom exists except
as a complication of the other kinds of stricture there
are two princi pal causes of oinic stricture inflammation of
the canal and injury by violence inflammation is by far
the most common cause and gonor rhoa is the common
agent by which it is exaled it is only in
exceptional cases that a stricture results from inflammation of the
urethra stricture in the second case arises from such causes
as falling across spars scaffolding lad ders etc or from
some sharp object which punctures the perinsmm the earlier symptoms
of stricture are a slil urethral discharge and pain in
the canal behind the seat of the stricture at the
time of micturi tion the stream of urine does not
pass in its ordinary form but is flattened or twisted
and as the disease advances it becomes smaller and ultimately
the fluid may only be discharged in drops the straining
efforts to discharge the urine often induce tenesmus as the
case ad vances the urine becomes alkaline and ropy and
deposits a predtate when allowed to stand attacks of complete
retention of urine occur with increasing frequency but these symptoms
are not in themselves sufficient to establish the presence of
stricture it is necessary to examine the urethral canal with
a catheter or bougie lo ascertain whether an organic obstruction
exists whether one or more strictures arc present and their
calibre the treatment of organic stric ture is chiefly mechanical
il is sufficient to restore the natural calibre of the
canal so far as this can be safely effected and
to maintain this patency after it has been established spasmodic
stricture usually occurs as a com plication of organic stricture
or of inflammation of the mucous membrane but may arise
from an acrid condition of the urine from the ad
ministration of cantharidcs turpentine etc and from the voluntary retention
of urine for too long a time the treatment consists
in the re moval of the causes as far as
possible and the use of a bot bath the inhalation
of chloro form sometimes gives immediate relief in flammatory or
congestive stricture commonly arises when a recent purulent discharge from
the urethra has been checked by external cold or wet
the treatment is much the same as that for retention
of urine consult rowlands r p the operations of surgery
new york 1915 strife by john galsworthy nothing is more
striking in worthys work as a drama tist than the
skill with which he combines the functions of the artist
and the social critic without prejudice to either in all
but two of his plays he has chosen for his
theme some one of the outstancung problems of modem social
organization and clothed it in dramatic form of compelling interest
in strife it h the conflict between capital and labor
as ex emplified in a prolonged strike at ihe trenariha
tin works the erectors of the company have been summoned
down from london or a conference with the men and
the action takes place during a single afternoon the company
is losing money the men and their families are starving
both are ready lo come to terms but their indomitable
leaders old john an cii ycooglc 8trigb8 strikes and lockouts
ts6 will not hear of compromise both men are filters
and both are fighting for a principle it is a
clearcut conflict of wills siii as few dramas present when
anthony talks to his frightened directors we feel that nothing
can balk that iron will but roberts passionate appeal to
his fellow workers to hold out in order that their
sacrifices and suffering shall not be in vaiti is still
more moving and no less force ful although the struggle
finally ends in com promise between employers and men ihe
tense emotional interest is maintained to the very end roberts
comes from the death bed of bis wife to fling
defiance at the board only to learn that the agreement
has just been sied and he and anthony face defeat
together with a like scorn of their weaker followers and
a re luctant sympathy and respect for each other while
these two are the chief protagonists galsworthy uses no less
than 30 speaking parts to fill in his picture and
at least half of these are clearly defined individual characters
shis canvas is neither crowded nor confused is is largely
due to his masterly command of natural and characteristic dialogue
his personages are never mere mouthpieces for his own ideas
but speak their own thoughts in their own language an
interesting comparison suiesls itself with certain plays of other nationalities
based on the same theme such as bjomsons beyond human
powftr hauptmanns the weavers bergsiroms lyngaard 8r co mirtieaus les
mauvais bergers lack of space forbids com parison in detail
but it is noticeable that all these plays culminate in
a scene of mob vio lence whereas galsworthy achieves the
effect of violent emotion and strained nerves by more subtle
means strife was first produced in a series of matinees
at the duke of yorks theatre in london in march
1909 the first american production took place at the new
theatre new york in november of the same year criuce

strikes and lockouts a strike is a cessation of work
on the part of working men to enforce their demands
against the em ployer or to resist demands and rules
made by the employer a lockout is a cessation of
work on the employers initiative to enforce demands against hia
employees strikes are essentially a feature of the modem industrial
organization they developed gradually with he progress of industry and
organiiation by unions of working men reaching their height in
the 19th century the largest and most important strikes having
occurred since 1870 while it is true that strikes have
increased as the modem labor union has grown yet it
is also true that many strikes oc cur in unorganized
or poorly organized indus tries and it has usually been
true that a young ornization is much more apt to
enter upon strikes as a means of testing its strenh
and enforcing its demands than an old organization the older
and stronger a labor union grows as a mle the
m to strikes and the less likely to order a
strike for petty and insufficient cause nevertheless strikes are a
recognized and important part of trade imion policy they are
defended by trade unions on the following grounds they are
absolutely the only means which labor has of enforcing its
demands in case argument and arbitration fail and afford the
most practical means of controlling the supply of labor for
the benefit of labor whether a strike succeeds or not
it attracts public attention to the ques tion at issue
and may lead to the satisfactory solution by the pressure
of public opinion they mark the line beyond which labor
will not be forced in the reduction of wages or
enforcement of unjust demands the very pos sibility of a
strike which jnjiicts an injury that the employer desires to
avoid often prevents the attempt to enforce demands which employ
ers know would be unwelcome to labor the more radical
view of a strike is based on the doctrine that
the interests of labor and capital are necessarily antagonistic that
a strike there fore is an attempt to advance the
interests of labor as against those of capital and is
from labors nt of view entirely right and justi fiable
it is a sort of advance slurmish in the war
of interests between labor and capital and useful as winning
some definite advantage to labor or of proving the slren
and vitality of the labor movement and inflicting a more
or less serious injury on capital against the pol icy
of strikes it is urged that they cause heavy loss
to both the labor and capital lying idle that with
their modern magnitude they seri ously affect the whole industrial
life and inflict an injury upon ihe general public and
that the points gained by lacior are not commensurate with
the cost of the strike it must be remem bered
however that a strike is essentially a war and that
many of the evils of war attend it whereas if
it be based upon a principle o justice it can
be defended upon the same grounds as a war cansei
of striko the chief causes of strikes are centred about
the wage question the largest number of strikes in the
decade of 18811900 were for increase of wages other important
causes are for reduction of hours against reduction of wages

the states most affected by the disturbances in thee years
were new york pennsylvania massachusetts ohio new jersey illinois and
connecticut in the order namea the trades most affected were
metals mining building textiles transportation and clothing sympathetic strikes the
svmiiathetic strike is one undertaken by a body of workmen
who have no special grievance of their own in behalf
of another body of workers on strike it developed about
1880 and was based uon the workingmans recognition of the
principle of the solidarity of labor the principle that la
bors interest are everywhere essentially the same and that an
injury to one is an injury to all the sympaihetic
strike is usually under taken by workingtnen employed by the
same employer as the original strikers or against an employer
in some direct relationship with the employer of the original
strikers as competitor buyer or seller or cooperating in this
way their action has direct economic effect on the question
at issue as well as the more general and less
tangible effect of sympathy sjm pathetic strikes involve the dangers
of violence and the weakening of a powerlui organization by
the keeping iifle of a body of men not so
closely bound together nor so individually in terested as if
the strike directly concerned their persona welfare nevertheless the mere
fact that sympathetic strikes are undertaken is a proof of
the development to some extent of a more enlightened and
farseeing selfinterest which often amounts to altruism among work ingmen
in connection with sympathetic strikes the question of the imiversal
strike may be mentioned a universal strike in all depart
ments of industry to obtain some special de mand is
naturally the lodcal development of the sympathetic strike the universal
strike has never been a problem for serious considera tion
in the united states but on the conti nent where
the tabor movement is largely di rected by the socialists
it has been frequently force the government to the adoption
of the principle of universal suffrage methods of conducting a
strike picket ing etc the ordinary method of beginning or
ordering a strike is by vole of those who are
concerned in the case of organized labor the matter is
usually referred to the national officers for an attempt at
settlement or ap proval of the action of the strikers
the latter securing the support of the whole organization often
in large strikes or in the case of par tially
organized industry appeal for financial aid and moral support is
made to labor in gen eral or to some large
general organization iet the federation of labor the interest of
the strikers is kept up and public interest aroused by
meetings speeches and the circulation of literature the most important
consideration is to prevent the breaking of the strike either
by defections from the ranks of the strikers or by
the bringing in of more workmen to take their places
the method generally adopted to prevent the latter is known
as picketing that is the placing of some men near
the establish ment involved in a strike to speak to
any who may come to take the strikers places and
o dissuade them from so doing this has led often
to threats and intimidation on the part of the pickets
and sometimes to violence the result has been that the
tendency of judicial de cisions is to declare hcketing illegal
or to so strictly limit the rights of the pickets
as to make their work practically useless a few states
have declared picketing illegal by statute an other method of
preventing workmen from taking strikers places is by large general
meet ings near the establishment involved or at the place
where workmen are brought into the town this however is
a more dangerous method than picketing as it is often
the means of collecting a large and irresponsible crowd quite
beyond the control of the leaders of the strike violence
in a strike probably works more harm to the strikers
than to any other thing il arrays public opinion against
them and brings against them the forces of govern ment
and the military trades unionists every where recognize this fact
and invariably de nounce violence whenever it occurs the vio
lence is often committed by persons having nothing to do
with the strike but taking the opportunity to do mischief
and when committed by the stnkers has not the approval
of organ ized labor it is often charged that strikers
have sometimes been provoked to violence by agents of the
employers in order to give bet ter cause for breaking
the strike such charges are difficult to prove but it
is generally tho opinion that such cases have occurred in
the coal fields at least if not elsewhere one of
the methods of fighting a strike is the injunction the
first time the injunction was of marked importance was in
the pullman strike of 1894 when the officers of the
american railway union were enjoined not only from threats intimidation
and encouraging violence but also from aiding or persuading any
persons to strike injunctions since then have been fre quently
used and are often very severe against the strikers the
terms of most sweeping in junctions however have usually been
changed in favor of the workingmen if the matter was
brought into court by the strikers history and statistics the
first strike on record in the united states is that
of the bakers in new york in 1741 the strikers
were brought before the court on a charge of clti
spiracj but not convicted the shoemakers of philadeliiia struck for
increase of wages in 1792 and three times subsequently before
1800 and were in every case successful in 1805 the
shoemakers again on strike were convicted in court on a
charge of forming a combina tion to raise wages and
were fined eight dol lars a head up to the
civil war strikes were comparatively tew and small in extent
thgr were mostly for increase of wages or reduction of
hours after the civil war the strikes in creased in
number and in importance in 1872 occurred a succession of
strikes jn the build ing trades for the eighthour day
which were mostly successful in 1877 was the great rail
road strike begun by the firemen of the balti more
and ohio against a reductitn of wages it spread to
the pennsylvaoia the erie the lake shore and numerous other
important ig v google stklndbbkd 737 railroads and involved a
large amount of violence and bloodshed particularly in the re
gion about pittsburgh numerous strikes have taken place in the
coal fields and have as a rule been attended with
more or less bloodshed though many have failed some have
been suc cessful and the miners have gained some im
portant points prominent among the coal strikes are those in
the bituminous coal fields in 1894 and 1897 the latter
resulting in a fairly satisfactory wage scale and those in
the an thracite coal fields of 1900 and 1902 that
of 1902 threatening a coal famine and being adjusted by
a commission appointed by the president of the united states
among other noted strikes was that at homestead in 1892
and the pullman strike of 1894 the latter was a
sympathetic strike undertaken by the american railway union in behalf
of the employees of the pullman company their purpose being
to boycott the pullman cars and prevent the railroads from
hauhng ihcm trairc was seriously delayed and considerable violence occurred
especially in chicago the national troops were brought into use
by president cleveland though against the protests of the governors
of illinois and other states the injunction before mentioned caused
the imprisonment of the president and other officers of the
american railway union and the strike was a failure though
for the firt few days it promised success the sutistics
of strikes for 18811900 show that there were 22793 strikes
involving 117509 establishments and 6105694 workingmen of this nuinber 5077
per cent were successful 1304 per cent partially so and
3619 per cent failed the greatest per cent of strikes
which were successful were for reduction of hours and isi
per cent partially so and 508 per of tbose for
recognition of the union were successful the statistics of lockouts
show 4293 per cent successful and amp28 per cent partially
so the first decade of the present centuiy was marked
in the united states by many strikes for the reduction
of hours eibt hotirs had become customary in many trades
and those unions not enjoyidg it made cottcerted efforts to
attain shorter nours and generally won among the most severe
and protracted of these strikes was that of the international
typo graphical union and affiliated organixattons in the printing trade
in 1906 this was bitterly fought in everv large city
in the country and was not entirely won or two
or three years the losses to the employers unions and
the public both direct and indirect were estimated at 25000000
as a result the printers league was organized by emplcyers
in the book job and publication branch of the industry
and mis body together with the american newspipct publishers association

target succeeded the railroad trainmen were among the last to
secure eight hours the cotnpantcs contend ing that the character
of nimty woric ym such that men had to continue
until the trains arrived at destinatloni so no hour sdiedule
wa possible the men demanded overtime miei for work beyond
eight hours and a nation vie strike was called for
4 sept 1916 at the time the railways were glutted
with btisi iiess and obviously a prolonged railroad strike meant
paralysis to more than half the industries of the country
and lack of both food and fuel in many places
president wilson demanded congressional legislation to meet the situation and
the adamson eighthour act was rushed through and put into
effect 1 jan 1917 the war situation in 1917 there
were numerous demands made on employers for higher wages growing
out of the presumed great profits of manufacturers working on
war orders the strikes were mostly settled by pay ing
the wages demanded and rapid increases of wages followed when
america entered the war the reduced number of workers en
abled workmen in many instances to dictate their pay and
this with a general understand ing that strikes were unpatriotic
reduced the strike evil for the time being owing to
the scarcity of domestic commodities however the advance in prices
and consequent high cost of living the demands on employers
for increased wages became more urgent during 1919 and re
sulted in many serious strikes lockouts and dosing of factories
arbitration in many cases was refused and the strike remedy
unfortu nately was resorted to with everincreasing fre ouency see

entirely to do with the teaching in the classroom see

the connection between flong and learning was the feature he

in the nature of that which we should call supervised
sports this being the case stiident life for the young
was happy and entertaining the greek boy played ball flew
kites and rolled marbles and engaged as he grew older

also a part of his instruction oratory and mumc came

our sense of the word but today even these subjects
are likely to be more thought of in the nature
of student life nibtr than a part of the instructional
work in our educational institutions d google studbnt life and
customs the roman schools partook a little more ot the
nature of actual classrooms though in most cases they were
merely a sort of perjiola schoolboy life was enlivened with
floggings as with the greeks but seemingly more system atic
classroom work was done by the romans the latter did
not ve the time to fonnal instruction in sports that
the greeks gave so that to the roman boy and
youth his amuse ments were much more his own marbles
blindmans buff hide and seek and other games of childhood
were played riding swimming and wrestling were however 3 regular
part of the instruction and the roman youth en tered
them with a seriousness that made them less a part
of the lighter side of life with the romans therefore
the sports of student life tended to fall into the
class of the pro fessionals for some centuries after the
gradual decline of the roman civilization until the beginning dencc
of any kind of school hfe when the church and
monastic schools did begin to come into existence they were
looked upon as places where in general boys were to
be prepared for the service of the church even those
who were not to be so prepared were given the
same kind of training in view of the severity of
the ideal of preparation for the church the school life
of the boy both during the hours of actual instruction
and outside of such hours was one of constant task
and supervision al most every sport to which a boy
of the time might turn was prohibited under the severest
penalties flogging even of young men of 18 was common
unlike the schools of the greeki and the romans those
in the middle ages were frequently of the kind to
which boys went to uve during their period of school
life the only holidays he had were those of the
church in spite of the extreme repression of all youthful
inclinations the hoys committed nu merous offenses in the schoolrooms
and in diapel some when they ot a chance to
get away from the strict supervision of the teacher indulged
in all kinds of prohibited sports such first hear of
those student groups which gave color to a real student
life such as we know it the freshman was then
as until recently in our own colleges and universities the
par ticiilar object of attack on the part of those
who had been in the institution longer than he he
was likely to be waylaid and thoroughly pummeled before arrival
in germany and france he was put through an initiation
hor dering on the grotesque horrible and cruel far wore
than the modem initiation to any of our secret societies
if he passed through such ordeals and succeeded in getting
rtstered with a master or in a college his life
in the class room and out of it was marked
by turbulence and hardship a master who deuvered his lecture
too rapi was interrupted with all kinds of noises the
lecturerooms were wholly unhealed in winter and the windows unguzeo
the floors were covered with straw on which the student
sat the rooms in which the stu dents lodged were
equally uncomfortable and the sanitary arrangements negligible the ec clesiastical
gowns which they were required to wear afforded them scant
protection against the cold unless they were fortunate enough to
be able to buy furs many of the students were
welltodo and others extremely poor in whichever condition they found
themselves let ters to their parents which have come down
to us give evidence of that almost chronic ap peal
ofall students in all ages for more money the poorer
students frequently begged and were sometimes oflidally licensed to do
so so many of their natural inclinations for the amusements
and sjiorts of youth were repressed by strict prohibitions that
the natural conse quences followed not having any outlet for
their youthful spirits they indulged in riotous conduct brawls amongst
the individual stu dents and those of different national groups
were frequent and occasionally a whole group of them would
get into conflict with the towns folk so that town
and gown fights became infamous as the students as well
as the towns folk went about armed these battles frequently
ended in bloodshed and death in spite of such incidents
which were of course not of the usual but of
the unusual class the medioval student did a goodly amount
of serious work some naturally more and some less the
absence of healthy sports to relieve the daily routine was
his most serious trouble the hold which student customs have
brought many of them far down into modem times not
only in europe but also in america curious survivals in
the treatment of freshmen fagging the confuct between the freshmen
and the sophomores represented at harvard until a short time
ago by bloody monday nit and at other colleges by
cane rushes and the like bear witness to this conservatism
the popularizing of college education and the removal b university
authorities of many of the restrictions on the natural impulses
of youth for activity have led to the gradual dis
appearance of uie many socalled medieval customs in their place
has grown up a be wildering variety of activities for
the student which form a large part of his life
a perufal of the daily or weekly paper or monthly
or annual periodicals published by the students in almost everyone
of our institutions of collegi ate rank particularly in the
united states re veals not only the uterary activity along
such hnes but in the notices which they publish they
bear witness to die existence of an ex tended variety
of sports baseball football rowing tenms lacrossei basketball hockey numerous
clubs and fraternities to which almost every mudent of any
walk in life may belong debating organizations dramatic societies pre
senting operas and plays musical clubs and orchestras foreign language
clubs and relius societies many of these intramural activities are
represented also by intercollegiate contests in almost all of the
sports in dehating oratory and music on the social side
dancing and singing in large choruses both during term time
ana at graduation exercises occupy a prominent place especially at
girls collies which after their establishment in many ways followed
in the footsteps of those for men luxurious living quarters

close ties to the institutions from which they were graduated
there the student hfe and customs take a longer lease

broad development of student life and customs as is found
in great britain and america the usual absence of dormitories
or living halls in the great universities of ger many
france italy and spain the treatment of ampe luiiversities as
great day schools the 1 practice of the students to
take some 5 of academic work in one institution and
some in another the slight development of athletics and other
minor factors have caused the failure to develop that variety
of student life and customs and that abiding affection for
the alma mater found in englishspeak ing countries student life
and customs in schools of ele mentary and secondary grade
were under the same repression as e colleges during the
middle ages and came out from under it far less
slowly than the latter the tendency to imitate the higher
institutions was very strong in all countries and during the
19th century the secondary institutions reflected the student life and
customs of the colleges and the ele mentary schools reflected
those of the second ary in large institutions of the
latter grade particularly m america are to be found the
same periodical publications athletic sports and contests literary clubs and
fraternities the same cohesive grouping of the student body the
same affection for alma mater as are found in the
colleges in a lesser degree and on a smaller scale
the large elementary schools reproduce the same life the drunkenness
and licentiousness which used to prevail in american colleges previous
to the close of the i9th century had very largely
disappeared in die earlier years of the 20th college pranks
resulting in the destruc tion of property had become fewer
in number and rough house tactics in secondary school life
had ceased to be so fashionable in the matter of
the elimination of drinking in ihe colleges america had progressed
far more rapidly than the countries of europe duelling such
as prevailed in german universities had never taken root in
america the establishment of academies and later colleges for girls
in america in the 19th cen tury led to their
own development of college life and customs these very rapidly
took on the color of almost exact imitations of those
which had grown up in the institutions for men the
publications literary clubs sororities in stead of fraternities and even
athletic con tests resembled those of the men though drinking
never prevailed to any extent cigar pte smoking among the
young women in amer ican colleges is on fhp increase
as the secondat and elementary schools for boys imitated in
the life and customs of the students the doings of
the colleges for men so the elementary and secondary schools
for girls tended to imitate the colleges for women in
england such close imitation of the life and customs of
mens institutions by the women is not found and on
the continent of europe the life and customs in institutions
for girls is very much more restricted in fact ffiere
is about them the same atmosphere that pre vailed about
the institutions for boys in the earlier middle ages bibliocraphy

student self government as an organized sys tem is the
product of modem times and of democratic ideas in its
ideal form it must not be confused with systems of
govemment of one cup of pupils by an older pupil
set over them an appointment from a teacher or the
head of the school such systems of mainuining good order
in the schoofroom and out of it existed in the
middle ages and continued down into our own day under
the names of prefec tural and monitorial systems though these
invojred the government and sometimes even the teaching of students
by students there was little about them to warrant their
being called selfgovernment sysrenu strictly defined self4ovemment of students implies
the existence of a system under which the students elect
their own leaders or com mittees to see that school
or college rules are obeyed and that violators are punished
even though in the background the siigtreme atithority of he
school or college officials is always present it is never
so apparent as to disabuse the student body of the
idea that it is to all intents and purposes governing
iself the most advanced steps in student self government under
such a definition have been taken in america the development
of a great number of extramural activities on de part
of college students led quite naruraltf to the or ganization
of governing bodies for such pur poses almost entirely free
from control by col lege officials in fact in some
cases the abitsei of selfgovernment in such matters faceaoie so
great that the college offictau aad lhlt alumm had to
interfere to set thing rigiitfuid to iibpose a supervision which
had not piwioiisly extited nevertheleu the inflttcboe of self goveminr
actioa in iheir own affairs made for the detelopmenl of
selfreliance and duncter and both college othciala and studcdts found
ii was but a short step to granting the partithpa
n of the students in matters heretofore deemed the business
of the profeisiooal stafi of the college one of the
first of these steps was that of selfgovernment in the
examination room this has commonly been defined as the honor
syg tem before its institution one or several college officials
were deputized to guard the examination room to prevent cheating
under the new system these officials were withdrawn and the
students put on their honor not to cheat and in
some institutions to report those whom they saw cheating in
general the bys tem has come into vogue far more
widely in the colleges of the south and west than
in those of the northeast another development has been in
talcing resident officials out of the dormitories or living halls
of the students and placing reliance on the honor of
the latter ta commit no infracdiws of the college rules
and to report students guilty of such still another development
in some colleges has been the elec tion by the
students of a committee which takes up the matter of
disciplining students and acts in consultation with members of the
fac ulty in important questions affecting the students in some
colleges the attempt to put these measures of student selfgovernment
through have met with failure whereas in others th have
been a success in the latter case reports would indicate
that although some weaknesses are discovered the general conditions are
no worse and are sometimes a good deal better than
when all of the government was directly in the hands
of college facials the most serious difficulty encountered is in
getting students to play the part of informer even though
the information given is secret and in the develtment of
selfgovernment in american public elementary and hi schools ew from
somewhat different motives at first it came into vogue through
the desire on the part of teachers to teach civics
or civil govern ment in a graphic manner inspired by
sudt a motive mey organized their classes into school cities
and states and sometimes the whole school was organized into
a great gor em mental mstitution with legislative execu tive
and judicial departments and an array of government officials this
organization was in many cases used as a selfgoverning body
but as was the case with the colleges some were
successful and some were not it usually dniended upon how
much backing and time the school teauiers and oflicials were
willing to give to it or how much they were
able to simplify and modify the structure to meet the
purposes of selfgovernment the enthusiasm of a teacher or a
principal made up for much and in almost all cases
there is evidence of a certain artificially and a feeling
that the school ofbdal is constantly behind the scenes to
make the wbeeli of selfgovemment work smoothly the value of
the systems is not always so much in what the
students accomplish as in the development of character which such
sys tems may produce teachers in high schools have sometimes
reported very adversely on students coming to them from selfgoverning
elementait schools and sometimes very favor ably the extramural athletic
and social activities of tlu secondary and elementary schools were
for a long time exclusively in the hands of the
google fu study cluamps stunoists students and tliought to be
no affair of the school authorities with the great increase
in their variety and importance especially in in lerscholastic contests
the coverninr hand of the teacher or principal had to
enter a large measure of selfgovernment however is left to
the student body the principal or teacher acting as an
adviser and only exercising a power of veto in extreme
cases the amount of selfgovernment in such matters is less
for the secondary schools than for the colleges and is
more than for the elementary school a fact natural due
to the differences in the ages of the students whether
the large amount of selfgovern ment allowed to students in
some of our col leges secondary and elementary schools is
go ing to be productive of the good results claimed
for it only the future will tell a survey of
the field at present would seem to indicate that the
american youth has not that lawabiding quality which is found
in old world commtmittes where the hand of authority and
the demand for obedience lies far more heavily opponents of
the system maintain that lawlessness and fjiil ure to obey
the command of govemmenlal iencies have increased since the discipline
and control of the school has been relaxed its supporters
however say that such symptoms arc due not to the
selfgovernment plan but to the great preponderance of women teachers
in the schools to the heterogeneous character of our population
and to the fact that in every new land where
people foreign to each other in race language and tradition

acipen serida of fishes now generally considered to constitute with
or without the paddlefishes ipolyodohlida the distinct order chondroitei formerly
the sturgeons were classified as carti laginous ganoids an arrangement
which ichthy ologists no longer find adequate this group is
considered to be one of the primary divisions of the
teleastomi and the modem sturgeons to be the degenerate descendants
of the more highly developed extinct forms this degeneracy is
expressed in the deficiency of the skeleton in numerous respects
the sturgeons are bulky fishes of elongated form the snout
is conical and tapering the mouth which is smxll toothless
and protractile is situated on the under surface of the
muzzle and is preceded by four tentaclelike filaments or barbiiles
the eyes and nostrils exist at the sides of the
snoul the head is completely in vested by ganoid plates
some of which are median while on the body these
plates are ar ranged in five longitudinal rows with smaller
plates between the tail is heterocercal or un equally lobed
and is provided with bony spines along its upper margin
a single dorsal fin is present and placed far back
as are also the anal and ventral fins spiracles or
apertures for the admission of water to the gills exist
on the upper aspect of the head the opercula or
gillcovers are of lire size but imperfectly os sified and
the branchiostegal rays are wanting there arc four pairs of
gills and a pair of pseudobranchix on the opercula the
internal skeleton is chiefly cartilaginous though the weak maxillary premaxillary

of the soft anat omy are to be noted the
presence of an elaborate spiral valve in the rectum of
pjloric ceca of a larve swim bladder communicating with the
oesophagus by a duct but without any highly vascular respiratory
area of several series of valves ir the bulbus arteriosus
or base of the aorta and of distinct funneushaped oviducts
all of these characters separate the sturgeons from the more
highly specialized spinyrayed fishes two to four genera and from
w to so secies have been recogniied by different au
ors the disparity arising from the great changes undergone by
these fishes in the course of their growtli all are
found in the norlhertl hemisphere and most of the species
are anadro mous living in the sea except at the
time of reproduction when ihey migrate up the rivers to
fresh water for the purpose of spawning the latest authorities

fies are also devoued in considerable quan tities and that
it may display considerable agil ity is attested by its
occasional leaps from the water the sturgeon reaches a length
of from s to 10 feet and a weight of
500 pounds though examples of that e are now exceedingly
rare formerly this fish was exceedingly abundant a fact frequently
mentioned by colonial and other in the delaware river where
the chief sturgeon fisheries exist it was not valued pre
vious to the last 60 years but when captured was
thrown away or an entire fish of several hundred pounds

in defensive operations within harbors whereas torpedoes are primarily an
element of offensive warfare by warships mines are generally classed
as fixed and float ing the fixed or stationary submarine
mine is fired by contact electricity timing device or fuse
such mines hich are extensively used by all navies are
rugged in design and may contain large charges of explosives
they are placed in position oy submarines and other es
pecially cqnipped minelaying vessels such mines are provided with anchoring
devicce and are deposited if possible in harbors and chan
nels of the enemy or in the paths of ocean
travel floating mines differ from fixed mine d google submarine
mines in that they arc unanchored and unless guard boats
are at hand to warn friendly vessels of iheir proximity
maj be as dangerous to friend as to foe such
mines must be according to the laws of war designed
lo become inoperative within a few hours after being set
adrift the german floating mines were often cast adrift in
pairsj connected by a hne about 100 feel long if
a ship runs between the two mines they are drawn
alongside the ship and exploded con tact depth mines which
rise to the surface if failing lo contact are sometimes
used with tell ing effect the essence of the depth
charge is that it explodes in the vicinity of the
submarine or other craft in case it fails to strike
the boat itself the use of the contact depth mine
pre supposes the necessary accuracy to strike the target the
high explosive mines used by the germans and other belligerent
powers known as submerged contact mines when first put in
place were so anchored that they were held at a
certain distance below the surface of the water it was
intended that they should re main invisible and be exploded
when struck bv any vessel that might come in contact
with them such mines may be removed by various methods
of dragging or sweepinb siich as by sinking a long
cable each end of which is at tachcdto a tug
and thus dragging a suspected locality submarine mines fixed and
floating are of three different kinds 1 observation mines fired
from shore when a ship is judged to be within
effective range of the explosion 2 aii lomatic mines which
are selffiring when struck by a ship 3 eleciricai contact
mines which on being struck by a ship give notice
to an operator on shore who by the throw of
a switch lires the mines as a rule the sub
marine mine consists of a metal case filled with high
explosives and fitted with a fuse that may be fired
automatically or at will by an operator located at some
distant poinl in shallow water the mine is laid on
the bottom and is known as a ground mine when
the depth is so great as to interfere with the
de structive force of the explosion the explosive is carried
in a buoyant cylinder or sphere which is anchored to
the bottom by a length of cable which causes it
to float at the proper depth to be struck by
a passing ship the mines the type in general use
being the electro contact mine are usually planted in rows
across the channel to be defended the mines in suc
cessive rows being staggered so that if a vessel should
pass through the first row it must inevitably strike one
or more in ihe fater rows they arc planted in
what is known as grand groups which consist of 21
mines in groups of three some distance in the rear
of the line of mines there lies on the bottom
of the channel a grand junction box from which seven
cables spread each leading to a triple junction box which
in turn controls its small group of three mines from
the grand junc tion box also the multiple cable winds
its way lo the switchboard connection in the oper atingroom
on shore the grand junction box is placed at the
centre of the line of mines and about 100 feet
to the rear the triple junction boxes arc laid in
a straight line at intervals of 300 feel from each
of these boxes separate cables lead to each of three
mines the mines 21 in all being spaced 100 feet
apart in a line which extends for 2000 feet across
the channel each mine is anchored by a cable lo
an anchor the lenph of the cables being such that
each mine will float at a deplh of 10 or
12 feet below the surface of the water by an
ingenious arrangement one three or the whole grand group of
mines can be fired either from tine operatingroom ashore or
by contact with a ship all at the will of
the operator no mine field is compielcj or can ever
be thoroughly effective unless it is protected by rapidfire guns
it is possible for small boats launches etc to be
sent forward ahead of the ships and set off the
mines bj exploding laree charges of dynamite in the mine

counter mining as it is called is by flanking the
field with battcriea of rapiafire guns in the european war
the outstanding anti submarine offensive project was the closing of
the north sea by a mine barrage extending from the
orkney islands to the territorial waters of norway together with
a barrage across the straits of dover the plan to
close the north sea and thereby deny enemy sub marines
free access to the atlantic from ger man bases had
its inception in the united states bureau of ordnance in
april 191 immediately following the entrance of the united stales
into the war at this time there had not been
developed anywhere a te of mine suitable for the scotland
norway line whereon the depths of water are as great
as 900 feet and where a prohibitive number of mines
of the then exist ing type would have been required
to mine this line from the surface to a depth
of 250 to 300 feet a special mineloading plant with
a capacity of more than 1000 mines a day was
established near yorktown va by the navy department in accordance
with congressional authorization about 11000 acres of land hav ing
been secured for the purpose an immense number of mines
were stowed at this depot and it included a mineloading
plant a mine assembling plant and storage for a large
amount of high explosives more than a score of cargo
vessels were placed in service as mine carriers to transport
mines to europe many mine layers and auxiliary vessels were
fitted out and assigned to the execution of the proj
ect the manufacture of the large number of mines required
was a work of unprecedented magnitude and necessitated unusual methods
il was dearly impossible in the time available to manufacture
die mine as a whole in any plant therefore the
mine was divided into its many tmponent parts and the
parts were sepa rately produced in a large number of
industrial factories throughout the country the submarine mine was invenied
by bush nell in 1777 improved by fulton in 1812

signaling is the art of producing sound waves in water
and of transforming them into air waves so that they
can be heard the art of submarine signaling has been
directed entirely toward safeguarding lives and properly a sea sound
waves can be trans milted through water from a suitable
source of sound and heard with well designed receiving apparatus
at greater distances and with greater certainty than is possible
through air with any soundmaking device that has ever been
pro duced this fact gave the incentive to tnose who
originally undertook the development of this art later as the
knowledge of submarine signaling increased it has become possible to
determine with considerable accuracy from a ship movia or at
rest the direction from which the sound 1 coming and
even the distance be tween the ship ana the soundproducing
de vice moreover the receiving devices have been so far
perfected that it is not necessary that the source of
sound should be made artificially the receiving devices can now
be made in such a way that the noises of
invisible ships moving through the water can be heard and
the posi tion of the moving ship relative to the
listener ascertained with the latest forms of sub marine signaling
devices it is possible to send and receive telegraph messages
transmitted by sound waves throtigh the water it must be
appreciated that no wires connect the sending and receiving stations
submarine signaling is wireless cotnmunication using compressional or sound waves
in water as the means rather than the transverse ether
waves used today in what is commonly called wireless transmission
history it haji been well known for nearly 7s years
that sound waves were transmitted through water in the same
manner as through air but to greater distances and with
greater velocity velocity of sound waves in air about pia

e c wood and reginald a fessenden receiving devices the
earliest sound re ceiving device for use in water was
employed by colladon and sturm in experiments made by them
in lake geneva in 1 the sound receiver was a
large ear trumpet the small end of which was placed
in the observers ear the large end was closed with
a twn plate and was f laced under water modifications
of this early orm are in successful service today but
the receiver most commonly used today is an elec trical
current varying device similar in principle to the telephone transmilier
generally used on land lines one of the problems in
submarine signaling which has been most difficult of solution was
to find a way by which the sound receiving de
vice should be responsive to the noises pro duced by
the distant source and at the same time would be
insensitive or nonresponsive to the noises produced by the impact
or move ment of the surface waves of the water
on the sides of a moving ship and by the
noises of the machinery within the ship innumerable means have
been suggested for eliminating these foreign disturbing noises called water
noises success has been attained by the use of a
properly designed microphone clement or button mounted in a special
form of water tight case fig 1 and when used
on ship board by suspending the microphones in tanks filled
with water or other suitable fluid these tanks are located
within the ship below the water line and are so
arranged that the fluid is in contact with the skin
of the ship it has been found that the sound
waves from a dis tant source pass through the steel
or iron skin of the ip with but little loss
from re ft eel ion or absorption and as a
consequence the sound waves from the distant source can ie
easily heard furthermore by this arrange ment the water noises
are reduced to a mini mum as the ship passes
through the water with the least possible disturbance electromagnetic devices
are less sensitive as receivers uian microphones and are con
sequently less disturbed by the waves pro ducing water noises
on account of this lack of sensitiveness they have not
been as com monly used as the microphone on the
other hand elect romagnetic devices have been made which can
be mounted directly in the side of the ship the
diaphragm of the instrument re placing a portion of the
skin of the ship which is cut away instruments of
this kind ar ranged in this way have proved most
efficient sound receiving devices soundprodacin devices the earliest soundproducing device
w3s a belt struck under water innumerable other means of
producing sound have been suggested tried and aoandonea water sirens
subaqueous explosions and similar methods have never been brought to
a degree of perfection which has made com mercial use
possible the submarine bell has remained up to the present
time with the ex ception of the fessenden oscillator to
be later described the most serviceable form of sub marine
sound producing device the development of a mechanism by means
of which a submarine bell can be operated commercially in
all weathers and for long periods of time has been
very difficult the froblem ha however been solved and several
orms of submarine bells are now made to meet service
requirements one form shown in hg 2 uses the movements
of the surface waves to give the power required to
strike the bell in this form the bell and striking
mechanism are supported at the requisite depth from a buoy
or float a wing platfonn or vane is hinged to
the sides of the bell case containing the striking medianism
and is so counterbalanced that as the bell case rises
and falls with the waves the differences in the move
ments of the bell case and vane cause a pow
erful spring within the bell case to be com siressed
and when fully compressed to be re eased file released
spring draws up the striker of the bell and causes
a sharp blow to be struck the bell mechanism is
such that whenever there is wave motion the hell is
operated at frequent intervals bells thus made can be kept
in successful operation for con siderable periods of time without
attention and that corrosion especially from sea water is reduced
to a minimum and as all of the parts within
the bell are immersed in oil the wear upon the
moving parts is small this form of submarine bell ts
the dis tinctive feature of the art of submarine signal
ing the bell is supported from a buoy moored in
places where there is no hghtship or where it is
practically impossible to obtain any other form of power with
which lo actuate he signaling device the bell stroke is
powerful cnou to be heard at all times much farther
than the uncertain signals that might be produced in the
air by a mechanism operated by the energy derived from
the motion of the ocean the submarine bell can be
used without requiring the attendance of an openr tar and
in places where it is impossible to utilize wireless apparatus
employing ether waves submarine oells of this type are to
day located at many points of danger on the coasts
of most maritime countries and the num ber of bellg
in service is increasing another form shown in fig 3
of submarine bell has been designed for use frinn litships
the blow of tbv striker upon the bell proper in
these bells is produced by compressed air derived from an
air compressor on the light ship viien signals are to
be sent the pneu matic bell is suspended from the
side of the lightship and the compressed air is delivered
to the bell through a hose by a simple arrange
ment the compressed air can he admitted by the normal
operation of a key or automatical thus code signals giving
the number of the lighthouse station can be sent out
during the time the bell is required for operation other
forms of submarine bells are avail able for special conditions

to operate the tstnes of the bell of the type
first described ve an electric bell is provided ivliich is
operated by electricity adcraied on shore and carried to the
bell by a cable another corunetcial form of sonndproduc ing
device for submarine work is the oscillator shown in fig
4 devised by proi reginald a pessenden the fessenden oscillator
is an elect rotnagnetic mechanism which is capable of producing
sound waves in water of very tittge amplitude and at
the same time can be cbn trolled with ease the
fessenden oscillator is shown in fig 4 a diagrammatic crosssectional
drawing of the oscillator is shown in fig s the
oscillator consists of a ringshaped electro magnet within which is
a steel cylinder or core upon which is wound the
requisite numlier of turns of wire in the air gap
between the core and the electromagnet is a copper tube
the supports of the copper tube are two steel discs
rigidly clamped to a shaft one end of which is
firmly secured to a steel diaphragm die outer face of
which is in cotitact with the water when the oscillator
is in use the field magnet is cnerted by a
direct current when the oscillator is in operation either for
sending or receiving when used for send ing an allemating
current of approxi mately 540 cycles per second is made
to pass through the core winding this causes cur rents
of electricity to be generated by indno tion in the
copper tube with the result aat great forces are prxidaced
which cause the tube to move back and forth at
the freqoency of the attematink current the motion of the
tube is transmitted to the diaphragm and to the water
in contact with it when the oscillator is used for
receiving the core wintfing is con nected to telephone receivers
when incoming sound waves actuate the diaphragm motion is imparled
to the copper tube and currents of electricity arc induced
into the core winding the currents in the telephone receivers
con nected to the core winding produce sounds of the
same periodicity as those vibrating the diaphragm of the oscillator
the fessenden oscillator when sending pro duces a series of
waves of constant frequency or pitch so long as an
atlernatine current is passed through its core winding by apply
ing the alterating current to the oscillator for different lengths
of time it is possible to send series of waves
of greater or less duration so that such series will
correspond to the dots and dashes used in telegraphic communication
direction fiodiat it is customart when submarine signaling devices are
used on ship board to use at least two instruments
and to so mount them that sound which reaches one
instrument may be screened under certain con ditions from the
other this is accomplished in the simplest case by mounting
two small tants on the ships plates inside trie ship
one on each side towitl the bow the tanks are
filled with water ltor other fluid and the sound receiving
devices are submerged in the water within ampt tanks each
bound receiving device is so arranged ttiat it can be
connected by means of a switch with telephone receivers which
can be heid at the ears of a listener when
sound waves from a distant source rotch a vessel equipped
in this way the sound vavea agitate the sides of
the vessel and ditough the mediimi of the water in
the tanks actuate the soundrcceiviiig devices thus vary ing tbe
electric current and so producii similar sounds in telephone receivers
the soimds heard in the telithone receivers will be loudest
when they are connected with the re ceiving device on
the side of the vessel nearest to tbe source of
sound by turning the vessel until the souitds are the
same from the re ceiving devices on both sides of
the vessel the direction of the sonrce of sound can
be ascer tained for the reason that when the sounds
are equal the vessel must be pointing directly toward ae
soothe of sound the socalled indicator box which is customarily
em ployed on ships equipped with microphones supported in two
tanks one on the star board and the other on
the port side of a ship is shown in fig
6 this device provides the means of connecting the telephone
receivers with the microphones tn either the port or star
board tank as may be desired while the above arrangement
is that which has been most commonly used in direction

of tkt americana submarine warfare of the many new instrrrnientalities
of destruction employed during die recent world war the submarine
tomedo boat proved the most effective it differs from battleships
and cruisers in that it operates for the most part
beneath the surface of the ocean it is slower of
speed frail of structure and possesses no facilities for the
ac commodation of crews and passengers fonnd or the vessels
which it sinks its inability there fore to comply with
the wellestablished rule of international law governing priie destruction which
requires a naval commander before destroying a merchant vessel to
provide for the safely of all persons on board raised
the question as to whether such craft were entitled to
a special immunity from the rule governing prize destruction by
cruisers and battleships in short whether the submarine may be
employed for the destruction of merchant vessels without violating the
law of nations as well as the principles of humanity
soon after the out break of the war the german
naval forces for the most pait were driven from the
ocean dgt google 766 submakihe watoram and compelled ia lake
refage tn their home girts or in those of neutral
conntries the ennans were therefore reduced to reliance upon submarine
torpedo boats in their naval operations against the enemy and
these were speedily built in large numbers and used on
an extensive scale by a decree of 4 feb 1915
the waters around the british isles were declared to be
a war zone within which it was an nounced all
enemy merchant vessels would if possible be destroyed notwithstanding the
inability of the destroying submarines to pro vide for the
safety of the crews and passengers found in such vessels
in pursuance of this decree scores of enemy merchant ships
includ ine great ocean liners like the ltisitania the falabo
the arabic the persia and many others were torpedoed and
sunk sometimes without any warning at all or after warning
which was insufficient to permit the persons on board to
take to the lifeboats in consequence of this mode of
warfare large ntunbers of noncom batants men women and children
of neutral as well as of enemy nationality lost their
lives a considerable number of neutral vesaels were also sunk
the excuse alleged by german in most cases being mistake
which was an in evitable result of a method of
naval warfare in which visit and search are never oractised
in consequence of the protest of the american government and
of its threat to hold the ger man government to
a strict accountability for the loss of american lives the
german govern ment in sttember 1915 while disclaiming all responsibility
for the loss of more than a hun dred american
lives on the lusitama gave the american government assurance that
in the future liners would not be sunk without warn
ing and without providing for the safety of the persons
on board unless the vessels attempted to escape or unless
they offered resistance the pledge however was not observed and
on 5 october m consequence of the american pro test
against the torpedoing of the arabic the german ambassador informed
the secretary of state that orders had been given submarine
commanders which were so stringent that the recurrence of incidents
like the torpedoing of the arabic would not again be
possible but notwithstanding these assurances german and austrian submarines continued
to sink merchant vessels enemy and neutral alike without warn
ing and without making provision for the safety of the
innocent persmis on board among the most flagrant instances being
the torpedo ing of the lulian liner arvcoiia on 7
nov 1915 with the loss of more than 200 lives
it was true that this atrocity was committed by an
austrian submarine but it was understood in die united slates
that the german pledge bound the allies of germany equally
with her self and the austrian government was fully aware
of the american position in regard to the torpedoing of
merchant vessels without making provision for the safety of their
crews and passengers and it was fully cognizant of the
pledges given by germany to refrain from the practice in
the future the action of the submarine commanders in continuing
to rrc upon the passengers while they were endeavor ing
to take to the lifeboats was characterized by the american
government in a note to austria as wanton slaughter of
defenceless noncombatants and a demand was made upon the atisirian
govenuneni that die ofisccr guilty of the act be punished
and that an indemnity be promptly paid for the loss
of american lives in fehniary 1916 the gecman rovenunent announced
that after 1 march its submarines would sink whenever possible
and without warning all armed merchantmen irrespective of whether they
were armed for defensive or offensive purposes the german government
look the position that a merchant vessel had no right
to carry guns not even for the ourpose of defense
althoth the practice of carrying arms for defense against unlawful
attacks had en followed by me merchant vessels of all
nations for 200 years the german government maintained that this
practice had been intro duced for the purpose of enabling
them to de fend themselves again tt pirates and later
against privateers but since piracy had disap peared and privateering
had been abolished by the declaration of pans in 1s56
the old rule no longer had any roifox ditre and
consequently the german government could not recognize it as binding
in short according to the german contention the rule was
never intended to au thorite merchant vessels to arm for
the purpose of defense against the lawfully commissioned war vessels
of belligerents in fact not only armed merchantmen but also
unarmed merchant vessels continued to be sunk notwithstanding the pledges
of september and october 19lf the torpedoing in april 1916
of the snsicx an unarmed english channel steamer with 380
passengers on board some 80 of whom lost their lives
came very near precitating a crisis in the relations between
the united states and germany the german government at first
denied responsibility for the act but when the proof produced
removed all doubt as to this the german government finally
acknowledged that the steamer had been torpedoed by a ger
man submarine the president in an address to congress on
20 april reviewed the history of german submarine warfare since
its inauguration in july 1915 and informed congress of the
contents of a note which he had two days before
dis paccbed to the german government and in which he
denounced german methods of sub marine warfare as contrary to
both the law of nations aqd the sacred principles of
humanity the president concluded by saying that unless the imperial
government should now im mediately declare and effect an abandonment
of its present methods of submarine warfare against pasisenger or
freit carrying vessels the government of the united states can
have no choice but to sever diplotnatic relations with the
genoan eimpire altogether the german government rejtfied that it had
imposed far reaching restraints in the use of the submarine
denied that the torpedoing of the sussex was but one
instance of a deliberate policy of in discriminate destruction of
merchant vessels of both enemy and neutral nationality as the
president had charged in his note declared that it was
ready to admit that there had been un avoidable errors
and again for the hundredth time placed the responsibility uoon
great bri tain for having proclaimed a blockade against germany
for the purpose of starving the ger d google subuarins
warparx 767 ever the gcrtnau government in the interest of
the sacred principles of humanity pledged itself that in the
future unarmed ocean liners would not be torpedoed without warning
pro vided tbey did dot attempt to escape or offer
resistance this was the third time a pledge of this
kind had been made to the american gov ernment like
the others it was not lived up to and a
considerable number of unarmed vessels were torpedoed and sunk by
german sub marines as time passed public opinion in germany
demanded a repudiation of the pledges fiven by the german
government and the re sumption of the policy of unrestricted
sub marine warfare the tightening of the anglo french blockade
and the growing feeling dia this policy alone could save
germany from de feat intensified the popular demand finally vcrnment
that in conseuence of a situation having arisen which forced
germany to new decisions germany most resume the liberty of
action reserved in the susiex pledge of 4 may 1916
and that therefore beginning on 1 feb 1917 german submarine
commanders would no longer be bound by the previous as
surances given to the american government german submarines would therefore
sink without warning all merchant vessels ntutral as well as
enemy encountered within a vast zone embracing more than a
million square miles of the open seas ltsec war zones
the new situation referred to in the german note was
the refusal of the entente powers owing to their lust
of conquest to enter into a discussion of peace terms
with germany and their avowed determination to starve the ger
man people into submission in brntal contempt of international law
the american govern ment it was added knew the steps
which ger many had taken to cause england and her
allies to return to the rules of international law and
to respect the freedom of the seas and the hope
was expressed that it would view the situation from the
lofty heights of impartiality and assist on their part to
prevent further misery and unavoidable sacrifice of human life in
coiueauence of this deliberate repudiation of its pledges the president
recalled the ameri can ambassador from berlin handed the ger
man ambassador his passports 3 feb 1917 and broke off
diplomatic relations with the ger man government the new policy
thus aiwounced by the ger man government was promptly and
ruthlessly put into effect and large numbers of merchant vessels
neutral and belligerent alike were torpedoed and sunk without warning
neutral vessels laden with innocent cargoes even when consigned to
their own governments ships humeward bound in ballast even hospital
and belgian relief ships proceeaing on missions of mercy and
philanthropy in fact vessels of every nationality and mission were
sunk as if they were pirate vessels down to 29
march 1917 226 american lives had been lost since the
out break of the war in consequence of the torpedo
ing of merchant vessels by german submarines in august 1917
the american consul mr frost at queenstown placed the total
number of british lives mostly noncombatants lost in consequence of
the german methods of sub marine warfare at more uian
10000 turning now to a cotislderation of the law fulness
of this method of naval warfare we may state that
a belligerent has an undoubted rit to sink the merchant
vessels of the enemy with certain exceptions eg coast hshing
vessels hospital ships and vessels on philanthropic missions in certain
cases as where he cannot take the prize in to
a home port for adjudica tion by a prize court
either because of im minent danger of recapture or for
lack of a sufficient coal supply or because of his
inability to spare a prize crew and the like but
a long established customary rule of the law of nations
requires that in such a case the com mander must
before proceeding to the destruc tion remove the passengers and
crew of the vessel and provide for their safety that
is he must take them aboard his own vessel or
allow them ample time in which to take their own
lifeboats this humane rule is expressly laid down in one
of the hague conventions in the declaration of london and
is even incor porated in article 116 of the german
prize code as promulgated in august 1914 it is an
equally established rule of the law of nations that the
captor must visit and search the vessel examine its papers
and inspect its caro in order to satisfy himself of
the nationality of the vessel and of its liability to
destruction the verification of these facts obviously can not be
made through the periscope of a sub marine at a
great distance the german gov ernment frankly admitted that the
obligation to provide for the safety of crews and passengers
was binding upon the commanders of warships and cruisers but
it denied that it was equally binding upon the commanders
of submarines for the reason that they were small craft
slow of speed frafle in construction and were with out
facilities for accommodating crews and passengers found on the vessels
which the destroy by reason of their lack of speed
it would often be impossible for them to give sufficient
time for the crews and passengers to leave the ship
and embark in lifeboats without exposing the submarine to destruction
by ves sels of the enemy which might upon signal
ar rive on the scene before the torpedo had done
its work uoreover it was argued british merchant vessels were
generally armed with guns which might be turned upon the
attacking submarine with deadly eltect in case it gave warning
and an opportunitv to the persons on board to leave
the ship before the torpedo was discharged the rule in
respect to providing for the safety of crews and passengers
the germans argued originated at a time when submarines nad
scarcely been dreamed of cruisers and battleships then were the
prin cipal craft employed for destroying enemy merchant vessels and
they possessed facilities for accommodating crews and passengers or they
could allow them sufficient time to take to the lifeboats
without themselves being exposed to the danger of destruction to
require sub marine commanders to ohscrve this rule would in
effect render the employment of the sub marine for the
destruction of prizes impossible and this being the only available
craft left to germany for carrying on the war at
sea she could not be expected to relinquish it new
situations said professor fleishmann of the university of konigsberg in
an article on the lusitania case necessitate new rules and
d google 768 submarihb warfare the submarine being a new
weapon is not bound to conform to the rules adopted
lonr aeo for the conduct of cruiser warfare wno said
professor zittelmann of the university of bonn would have thought
at the time ihe old rule regarding provision for the
safety of crews and passengers of the possibilities of sub
marine warfare had the use of submarines been anticipated he
says special rules govern ing their employment would have teen
de vised see his chapter in a book entitled deutschland
und der ivellkrieg 1916 the submarine said count bernstorff in
a memoran dum laid before the department of state on
8 march 1916 is a new weapon the use of
which had never been regulated by international law from this
doubtful premise he drew the unwar ranted conclusion thai in
using this weapon germany could not and did not violate
any existing rule of law in the main the german
argument reduced itself to a claim of special immunity for
sub marines because of their peculiar build and con sequent
weakness since it is impossible to cm ploy ihem in
conformity with the long estab lished rules governing prize destruction
their commanders are relieved from die obligation to do so
in shorty a prohibited method of war fare becomes legitimate
whenever a new instru ment for doin il is invented
that is when ever an immediate belligerent interest would be
subserved by the employment of an instrument which cannot be
employed in conformity with the existing rule of law the
rule may be over ridden and the interest allowed to
prevail this argument is specious it ignores the fundamen tal
fact that the rule of international law which requires naval
commanders to spare the lives of innocent noncombatants on the
merchant vessels which ihey destroy was adopted in the interest
of humanity and was intended to govern prize destruction by
any and all tes of vessels which then existed or
which might be invented in the future to argue that
a sub marine commander may drown unoffending noncombatants but that
the commander of a cruiser cannot is preposterous the employ
ment of new instruments and agencies of destruction must be
adjusted to the require ments pt the law not the
law to the instrument it cannot be admitted that the
invention of a new weapon may serve to repeal the
law of nations and of humanity the german defense harmonizes
well with their theory that what ever is effective and
whatever tends lo shorten the war is legitimate in its
final analysis it amounts to a claim that a single
belligerent may at will change the law of the sea
to meet his own immediate necessities the united states supreme
court in the case of the scotia laid down a
principle of international law which has never before been contested
that the law of the sea is universal and cannot
be changed by a single nation germany there fore had
no right to repudiate a long estab lished rule which
by common agreement had come to be a part of
internalionar law it will readily be admitted that the introduction
of the submarine will necessitate certain modifications of international law
those governing blockade for example but il cannot be admitted
that the can alter what the president of the united
states called those rules of fairness reason justice and humanity
which all modern opinion regards as imperative the germans claim
in fact that in many instances in which their submarines
destroyed merchant vessels thej saved the persons on board whenever
possible but there are al most no recoiled instances in
which crews or assengers were taken aboard the submarine or
the good reason that submarines have no accommodations for any
but their own crews the germans likewise claim that wherever
pos sible they allowed sufficient time for the not done
are so numerous that il may be said that the
contrary practice was rather iht rule in many cases where
warning was given be force the torpedo was discharged lee
period of time allowed sometimes not more than 10 minutes
was wholly inadequate and instances were common in which huge
ocean liners sank while the passengers were endeavoring to leave
the ship increcuble as it may seem also in stances
are not lacking eg the ancona in which the crews
and passengers were dehber ately shelled while taking to the
boats even when ample time was allowed the passengers to
leave the ship it was only a technical com pliance
with the rule requiring naval com manders to provide for
the safety of the per sons on board for they
were set adrift in small boats often hundreds of miles
from land sooietimeb in midwinter without food or drink ing
water and left to drift at sea for days to
suber the tortures of thirst and htinger to die of
starvation or exposure to cold or to be washed overboard
by rough seas and to drown while struggling to save
tncnielvea the ger man government readily admitted in a note
of 29 nov 1915 relative to the siiikiiig of the
frye that this procedure was oot a sufficient conipliaacie with
the spirit of the rule nor in accord with the
assurances which were given the gdvemment of the united states

war anst unoftending non combatants who were in most instances

the german government pretended to be filling for sheer ruthlessncss
and barbarity there is nothing comparsale to it in any
other modern war german methods of submarine warfare have frequently
been characterized as piratical technically of course their sub marines
were not pirates since their command era bore eommissions from
a belligerent gov ernment but they might with reason be
con sidered as pirates within the meaning of the old
rule which defined pirates as hostes humani generis naturally few
reputable authorities on international law outside germany have been found
to defend such methods of warfare and even in germany
and austria ihey have been denovmced as barbarous bj many

dutchman comelis van dri bel in 14 invented a successful
submarine rowboat and king james of england was pas senger
on one in a subaqueous voyage on the river thames
contemporaries describe the vessel as an ordinary large rowboat decked
over with stout wellgreased leather about 1652 le son a
frenchman built a wooden submarine known as the rotterdam boat
72 feet long 12 feet high with 8 feet beam
it had sharpy tapering ends and sloping sides for defense
against projectiles and irontipped legs for resting on tiie bed

with a 50ton sloop on a bet in plymoutii harbor
but the boat failed to rise and he was drowned
in 1776 david bushnell a native of connecticut invented his
submarine or rather submersible boat turtle so christened because its
sides were shaped like the shell of a turtle when
submerged the head of its single passenger remained above the

holland an irishman in 1875 built a 16teet long two
feet tliameter cigarshaped submarine vessel in new jersey holland no

to the bottom of the enemy ship and then exploded
like the plan of bushnell with his turtle the craft
was divided into an air chamber fore and aft and
two compartments amidships in one of the latter of which
the operator reclined while working pedals with his feet to
turn a propeller in the stem it enabled holland to
practice navigation beneath the passaic river and neiojiboring waters holland
no 2 was launched in 1877 and stuck in the
mud she was furnished with an outer hull for water
ballast and was driven by a four horsepower petroleum engine
a few experiments proved to both inventor and spec tator
that she was a failure and he sunk her after
salvaging the engine he persuaded the fenian btothorbood to pay
for the construc tion of two of his ubmarines with
a view to attackif english menofwar but they do not
appear ever to have shown activity hol land constructed five
more submarines without profit but in 1893 colress made an

the united states navy her power was conveyed on the
surface bv a sohorsepower gasoline motor and by electric storage
batteries when submerged and he combination of the two methods
of pro pulsion was the great holland achievemenl upon filling
her water tanks she sank till flush with we waters

boxshaped submarine craft which he named argonaut junior that could
sink to the bottom of a river or lake and
permit a passenger to emerge through the bottom by an
airlock filled with compressed air the passenger equipped with a
diving suit could searlt the bottom of the river the
strange craft was mounted on three wheels the front pair
was rotated by hand gear the rear one did the

hull 36 feet long on similar principles but with a
30 horsepower gasoline engine the fresh air being supplied through
a hose con nected with a float on the waters

argonaut relied on two anchor weigbts of over 1doo pounds
attached to cables and raised and lowered by a drum
on the vessel on lowering the weights to the bed
of the river then letting in water to ballast compartments
the weight cables were hauled in till the ves sel
rested on her wheels at the bottom of the water

be very elaborate and complicated the submarines internal bewildering labyrinth

space is the wonder of those few visitors who are
allowed an inspec tion of their interior workings we whl
give a diort review of the subject as described by
stich experts as m f hays and others liulu submarines
are built with double and single hulls the latter have
to be of con siderable strength to resist the pressure
when submerging deeply necessitating a circular or nearly circular cross
section they were of socalled spindle shape both ends tapering
to reduce the resistance in motion but to obtain better
seagoing qualities the bow and stem have been modified in
recent ci istruction the holland type has single and diuble
hulls the labeuf type has an inner hull cylindrical with
flat ends this is enclosed entirely in an outer hull
pointed at each end to reduce resistance in motion the
latter are used by the french aus by an outer
construction as employed by the italian portuguese and brazilian navies
and designed by maj cesare laurenti of the fab brica
italiana automobil torino fiat while the dutch and danish navies
have used a com eosite hull designed by m f
hay other types ave of course been developed 0i steam
soon had to give way to highspeed internal combustion engines
the first hollands built for the british navy were fitted
with fourcylinder vertical engines next came 16cylinder wolseley horizontal motors
with 550 horse power later with increased dimensions they arrived
at 850 horse power giving 16 knots surface speed the
remainii defect was the noxious gas from the petrol or
gasoline fuel sickly as well as dangerously ex plosive not
to mention carburetor objection so wellknown to aviators then came
the new diesel motor invention using heavy crude oils and
all the above troubles were wiped out when the early
slowspeed defects were over come england used her first diesel
motor on submarine dl in 1907 developing 1200 horse power
its simplicity of operation though complicated in mechanism makes the
diesel engine see internal combustion en gine perfect for surface
propulsion its low cost of running also being much in
its favor a development of 5000 horse power by 191s
was a great advance over two and fourtyde engines the
fiat firm advanced the high speed diesel greatly and britain
graduauy took up the work all boats since and includ
ing the e and f class have diesel engines diesel
ennes have been used on all united states holland boats
for the last ten years the driving power for underwater
activity remains eleclridt derived from batteries placed below ibe main
floor of the machinery space on later types of submarines
batteries are placed in a leadlined compartment to prevent corrosion
of hull by sulphuric acid fumes but in recent types
the diesel engine charges the bat teries and does away
with these dangers krupps of kiel and man of nuremberg
developed at the german governments expense engines best adapted for
their 900 tons submerged displace ment submarines and 1915 two
diesels of about 900 to 950 brake horse power were
in stalled on each and found to act admirably many
other navies were supplied with them the man diesels constructed
at augsburg fourcvcle 800 horse power and the nurem berg

fiat twocycle 1300 horsepower motor has been used by both
italian and british submarines having six cylinders and 400 revolutions

horse power were used at that time 1915 by the
united slates and japan the polar stockholm sweden four cycle
motor was used by the swedish navy try reducing the
vessels buoyancy by filling her tanlts with seawater the tanks
of the single bull construction are of course built inside
the vessel whereas in the case of double hulls the
intervening space between the hulls is the tank space but
the disposition and dimensions of these waterballast tanks is one
of the most important problems of submarine building the safety
as well as the efficiency of the vessel hinges entirely
on the absolutely correct calculations made in designing the sub
marine the history of failures ana accidents is generally that
of faulty tank distribution with full tanks the vessel must
lie on a level keel under the water the tankage
space has to be divided into a dozen or more
compart ments so that each unit shall be strictly self
contained in its action and each tank must be completely
filled before submerging this set of main ballast tanks has
to reduce the huoy an leaving only 25 per cent
in about the midale of the ships length is another
tank known as the central midship buoyancy or auxiliary tank
this must never be com pletely filled after submerging next
come the trimming tanks located fore and afi used in
maintaining the vessel on an even keel when getting ready
to submerge all submarines have the above tanks to them
are added generally compensating tanks each to comjjensate for the
consumption used up in operating thus we have fresh water
the torpedo the fuel and the lubricating oil compensation tanks
all needed to maintain the original weight a safety tank
is installed in some submersibles for use in case of
emergency accidents etc this is quickly emptied by air pressure
bui in recent constructions each tank is made capable of
being emptied by air pressure mak ing the special one
unnecessary emptying the tanks qutckl brings the submarine speedily to
the surface in case of accident steering gear steering can
be performed on top of the conning tower in the
conning tower or in the central station properly called central

the larger by electricity but in the latter case as
on other ships emergency handgear is provided for use in
case of electric trouble an indicator along side the steering
gear shows the rudders po sition and direction is found
by repeating com pass when a goscopic master compass is
in stalled otherwise the steering station has its own compass

master compass dniing gear the diving hydroplanes horizontal rudders are

erer since tbales ex plained the universe in terms of
water there has been an almost irresistible tendency among philosophers
to explain the unity of intricate assemblages of phenomena in
terms of a per manent quadmaterial substratum or as it
19 technically known a substance the notion of substance runs
through the entire preisocratic philosophy and the platonic realistic hypostasis
of the ideas makes of them something very like the
substance of the particulars which they em brace substance first
receives its name and its separation from form in the
philosophy of aris totle but this separation is by no
means com plete substance or rt iiroxtiifkaitv is for aristotle
at once something like the explanatory principles of thales and
the other presocratics and a form or essence endowed with
actual existence into the form or essence of a pai
ticular not all its attributes enter but aristotle never makes
clear the principle in accordance with which the essential may
be separated from the inessential the scholastic view of substance
a a per petuation of that of aristdtle the essence
aspect of substance was transmitted by the scholastics to tiie
earlier modern jrfrilosophers of the continent though the latter progressively
emphasiied the function of substance as a sub stratum descartes
makes mind and matter his two substances and defines substance
as diat which depends iot its lexistence on god alone
god is clearly the ultinute cartesian substance this view is
modified by spinoxa thon more in terminology than in fact
he holds wat god is the one substance and that
mind and matter are two among his inampnite nutnber of
attri butes whether god is skniy the sttm of his
attributes is left uncertain the leifaniian concept of substance is
not widely different from that of descaftea but the nnmber
of dif ferent substances the motuda is multiplied indegnitely the
british pkilotodiers from the start mixed less of the aristotelian
notion of form and essence with their subalratunsufaataacc than their
coheagues on the continent locke followed descartes in his dnalism
but saw that a substratum which is nothing more than
a sub stratum can only manifest itself through its appearances
and is wiknowame in its itmer es scdce once this
became clear it was obvious that we might remove the
sutatance from the assemblage of amwardnces overlying it without making
any noticeable diilerethie but of two indistinguishable situations it is

v google 776 substrrutimifi au imrats does not berkeley accordingly
fscarded sub stance fratn the realm of matter he believed
hnwevflr that a substantial subject was necn sar for cognition
hume followed berkeley in reducing the material world to its
fcnomena but saw that the notion of snbsiance furnished as
little support for the states of a mind as for
tbe qualities of a material object combining una with his
unwillingness to admit the exist ence of anything of the
nature of a general idea or universal he was necessarily
driven to the opiition that things are mere aggregates of
their appearances which are assoaated together in a manner quite
independent of any inherent re tatednesa on their part the
humian refutation of substance is es gcntially valid the vtry
least which we can demand of a principle of explanation
is that it should explain and the explanation of a
group of facts is essentially the more intimate correla tion
of them with the rest of our knowledge after we
have been told that the attributes say of the material
world are unified through their inherence in a material substance
we know just as little of their bearing on one
another and on our remaining stock of information as before
nevertheless hume went too far in denying to the mental
and material aggregates of phenomena reectively all unity other than
that which is furnished bv the power of ideas to
attract associates suoi collections of enti ties as the material
world the world of mind individual minds etc have prima
facie a very real unity the unity namevi that consists
in their forming systems it may be shown by such
means as are used in the article on uni versal
that this unity is not purely illusory in the posthumian
philosophies smne such no tion of system tends to replace
the older con cept of substance in the philosophy of
kant the systemnotion of the unity of phenomena and the
substratum noticm are both found and are almost inextri cably
interwoven kant retains the old im knowable substances of hume
under the name of the thitigsinthemselves while be re gards
the existence of these as indubitable be nevertheless excludes them
from any active part in his critical philosophy in so
far as this concerns itself with the pure reason within
the realm of phenomena the substances are just such relatioful
structural complexes as lve been described in the last paragraph
indeed substance is made a categoi ci relation the followers
of kant retained this latter phase of his views on
substance and discarded his thin in themselves they made the
entire uni verse their trltimate reahty but though they gen
erally viewed this in the lit of a system there
was not wanting among them the tendency to revert to
the substratum idea however sub stance except as the absolute
may be substan tial was ikt assigned a fundamental status
thus in the philosophy of heil stastance is but a
stage of the cosmic dialectic not its temu though the
problem of substance under its own name has ceased to
play any great part in current philosophical disjmtes there are
not wanting in the system of the present day enti

railways now common in ddes have come to bear this
name of all the difficult problems that have arisen as
a result of the reat and continuous concentra tion of
population in cities the most difficult itnd the most expoisive
to be satisfactorily solved is the furniuiing of suitable and
econom ical means of local travel with the enormous vehicular
traffic that congests the streets the surface cannot be used
except for lines whose speed bong limited by the ordinary
street con ditions is loo slow except for short distance
journeys in some american cities and in a few exceptional
cases in european elevated railroads have been constructed to furnish
means of travel on which traffic freed from surface conditions
could move more rapidly such railroads although successful in them
selves are so unsightly and so objectionable to the abutting
houses that thev are disliked with the surface impossible for
use for ratnd transit purposes and with the supersurface undesirabte
for such use recourse is necessarily had to the subsurface
and it is in the develop ment of subsurface lines
that there is the greatest activity to this class of
railroads and regardless of the method of construction whether by
tunnel or by open excavation the generic term of subway
bas come to be ap plied liiis name is now
used to describe a railroad built benearti the surface with
stations at comparatively short distances apart and pri marily intended
to serve the needs of local tran sit in a
thickly populated locality htotory the first city in the world
to feel the need of subways was london where in
18s3 there was begun the construction of a twotrack undetyround
road from edgeware to kings cross from this benning there
were finally produced two lines known as the uetro politan
railway and the metropolitan district railway die greater pan of
whose construction was finished prior to 1870 these roads were
not given a satisfactory location a compromise route having been
determintd on by which it was attempted to serve as
many districts as possible the result beii that the line
lacked directttess this error m proper route selec tion and
the fact that the railways were neces sarily operated by
steam locomotives the onhr means ttien at hand rendering them
exceed ingly disagreeable for passengers fuled to pro duce satisfactory
tinandal results and conse quently to furmsh any encouragement for
an early repetition of a similar experiment in lon don
or even less so in other cities where the demand
for transit facilities was less strong it was not until
1886 that any further attempt was made to construct a
subway line in that year the late j h greathead
an eminent eng lish engineer designed a railroad drcubr in
section lined with cast iron which it was at google
first intended to aperate with a cable such method of
operation having proved successful in america for surface lines avoiding
the dis agreeable codsequcncce of operation oy steam locomotives before
the line was completed it had been demonstrated that such
railroads could be successfully operakd by electricity and so that
power instead of cable was installed this tubular railroad the
first to be prac tically operated the prototype of many
others having conclusively shown that by means of electricity subways
could be operated not only free from the objections of
steam operated linesif and free from the objections to the
construc tion of elevated lines but also more econom ically
than by steam a serious study of the problem was
at once taken up in new york boston paris berlin
and buoapesl the last named city has the honor of
having produced a new type of subway which has influenced
the most approved form of construction this road was built
with a flat roof consisting of steel beams with arches
turned between ampem per mitting the whole structure to be
broibl close to the surface of the street and was
uerefore in direct opposition to the greathead method in which
the railroad was carried at a great deth below the
surface of the street ecc4si tating mechanical means of taking
the passen gers from platform to street level this fine
in budapest was put in successful operation in 1893 in
the meanwhile similar tines bad been projected both in new
york and in boston btil owing to cerlain legal delays
in the former city work was first begun in boston
the utter subway was intended for the accommodation of the
surface trolley cars in order to carry theat through the
congested centre of boston where on account of the narrowness
of the streets the speed of the cars had been
necessarily reduced to a rate that was intolerable the first
subway planned in boston was partly a twotrack structure and
partly s four tracjr structure and had a length of
17 miles this has since been increased and the subway
has also been connected with the elevated rail road system
so that at present both the elevated trains and trolley
cars pass through it when these various railways were put
imder ti operation the era of subway in glasgow and
berlin some of the shaltew type and some of the
tubtflar type and elaborate and complex studies were being prepared
for both paris and new york although the work of
iteginnin subway construction in these two last named cities had
been retarded for one cause or another the delay has
nevertheless worked to their advantage as the experience gained at
other points bad proved of great benefit these two systems
now present itremost advanced and the highest development in the
art of subway construction work on the first line was
begun in paris in 1898 the french engineers instead of
doing as had been done elsewhere laying out short and
detached lines to serve the most urgent requirements and without
regard as to the definite part that such lines would
play in the final plan of urban development laid out
at the beginning a comprehensive map of a great system
covering the whole of paris embradiv all the lines that
codld reuonauy be foreseen aa necessary or desiirigtie this plan
covers 47 miles 01 railway all of which are considered
as a unified system to be operated as a whole
and the construction of which has been steadily proceeding the
work of building the subway in new york did not
begin until the year 1900 in no city in the
world are the demands for transit facilities as reat as
in new york on account of the peculiar shape of
the dty the main travel is necessarily coikenlrated on a
few wellestab lished north and south lines and althou great
as is the carrying capacity of die elevated and surface
systems such capacity is much interior to the demands of
the population at the time the first subways were opened
the number of paying passengers on the street railroads of
new york exceeded 1000000000 per annum it was decided to
build a subway railroad with four instead of two ticks
of these four tracks two are used for express trains
that is trains that stop at intervals of about one
and onchalf miles and two of the tracks used for
local trains which stop at intervals of about onequarter of
a mile m order to diflerenbate between the passenger who
desires to travel a long distance and the one who
desires to go a short one the initial subway had
a length of 20amp miles of which b miles are
of fourtrack 67 miles of threetrack and 78 miles of
twotrack this road bns at a point in front of
the city hall extends northerly to kiogsbridge in the north
western part of the city and to the zoological gardens
in bronx park in the northeastern part of the dty
being in plan like the letter y when this work
was about half completed a second subway was designed and
contracted for to extend the above railroad southerly along broadway
from the city hall and under the east river to
a point in the borough of brook lyn this extension
consists of 28 miles of twotrack and 07 mile of
threetrack making in all 243 miles in length with 8amp6
miles of track exclusive of side tracks soon after this
first subway was in full operation from at lantic and
flatbnsh avenue station in brook lyn to van cortlaadt park
on the west side and to bronx park on the
est it was seen that additional transportation laciuties would be
required widiin a very few years negotiations to this end
were initiated by the new york public service commission with
the brooklyn rapid transit and the laterbo rough rapid transit
in 1911 and on 19 march 1913 the so called
dual contracts were signed by these companies on the one
hand and the city of new york on the other
under diese con tracts the cost of construction was lo
be borne partly by the city and partly by the
operating compaeies the latter agreed also lo extend their elevated
roads and lo increase the facili ties of existing roads
by third tracking or by constructing a second story structure
the contracts called for the construction of 4455 miles of
new subways 5310 miles of new elevated railways and 198
miles of third tracking or other additional track the new
lines now practically completed consist of 3i30 miles of single
track made up of 260 miles of subwav 45 miles
of elevated and 25 miles of new iurd rack taken
in connection with the dy google 7t8 svbv old lines
with their 330 miles of track con stitute a mileage
exceedinj that of all the other rapid transit systems of
the world the year 1918 saw a number of the
new lines included in the dual system placed in operation
leaving to be finished those lines providinf new routes between
brooklyn and queens and manhattan by tunnels underneath the east
river these tunnels are difficult engineering feats and re qnire
a longer time than does ordinary subway or elevated railroad
construction subsequent to the completion of the first subway the
city determined to build certain additional lines m cluding the
socalled triborough route in man hattan and the bronx the
centre street loop in manhattan and the fourth avenue subway
in brooklyn all these lines later were in cluded in
the dual system of die dual sys tem subway lines
there were opened previous to ims exclusive of the first
or old subway the queensboro subway the fourth avenue sub
way in brooklyn its 86th street extension its sea beach
branch to coney island its new utrecht avenue branch the
astoria branch of the queensboro subway the white plains road
extension of the first subway the corona branch ot the
queensboro subway the jerome avenue branch of the lexington avenue
sub wavt a portion of the seventh avenue subway the
west farms subway connection and the broadway subway manhattan almut
170 track miles of new lines were in operation at
the beginning of 1918 on 1 july 1918 the new
seventh avenue subway was placed in partial operation from 33d
street to south ferry and on 17 july the new
lexington avenue subway was placed in use fram 42d street
to 167th street in the bronx on 1 aug 1918
the socalled h system was tried the beginning of this
system terminated the service of the old subway as it
had been riven for 14 years under the h system
the old subway from limes square north with its branches
was joined to the new seventh avenue subway thus constituting
the west side subway while the pan of the old
system south from 42d street and fourth avenue was joined
to the new lexington avenue line and its bronx brandies
making a complete through line all on the east side
from south ferry to 167th street in the bronx this
division of the 6ld subway left the part under 42d
street from grand central station to times square as crossbar
to the n its tracks were assigned as follows two
tracks for a shuttle service between the east side and
west side lines and two tracks for a continuation of
the queensboro subway west from grand central to times square
very serious delays in the work of construction of the
new lines occurred in 191718 owing to the fact that
the demands caused by war condi tions had been such
as to delay the work and in some respects to
bring it to a halt more subaqueous tunnel work is
under construction for dual system lines than has ever been
at tempted before this work represents an ex penditure of
about 30000000 and includes four new tunnels of two tubes
each and one tunnel of four tubes the last named
connects the lexington avenue line in manhattan with its bronx
branch the other tunnels mentioned are the 60th street tunnel
connecting the 59th street subway with the queens line the
tunnel for the 14th street eastern line the new inter
borough tunnel between manhattan and brook lyn and the tunnel
connection between the broadway subway in manhattan and the fourth
avenue subway in brooklyn the total cost of new yorks
dual subway system includitig equipment real estate power house construction
and changes interest during construction etc will be about 400000000
of this sum about 60000000 is contributed by the brooklyn
company about 146000000 by the interborough and the remainder ap
proximately 194000000 by the city of new york the general
type of subway adopted for new york was of the
flat roof shallow form brining the rail and platform level
as close to the surface of the street as possible
the ir regular topography of the city however has compelled
a departure from this wpe in several instances so that
a portion of the road is in ordinary deep tunnel
and the rtion beneath the east river and the approaches
thereto is of the tubular type as adopted in london
while this work of subway construction had been going on
in other cities london had made many additions to its
subway construction by builaing detached and separately operated lines on
the tubular principle there having been a derided 0pular prejudice
against any form of construction that would threaten to interfere
with surface travel during construction or that would invade the
vested rights of the several local governments which form the
constituent parts of the government of the metropolitan district or
what is commonly known as london coilttructioil the construction of
sub ways presents a wide field for the display of
engineering skill and ingenuity as a modem line demands the
application of nearly all the principles on which enneering science
is liased at the time when the nrst railroad was
built in london iron was expensive and steel as a
ma terial of construction unknown and recourse was had to
masonry except in cases where the use of iron girders
was efcligatory the struc ture was therefore a continuous ardiway
and calls for no extended description when the city and
south london railway was bun cast iron was sufficiently cheap
to be used at that time the building of a
line so near the surface as to disturb it even
tem porarily was out of the question owing to the
opposition of various interests mr greathead therefore decided to make
a deep tunnel which he built by means of a
shield such as is com monly employed in deep turned
work in soft the advantage attending tubular construction is that
it cart be carried on without the inter ruptlon of
surface traffic but the disadvantages are that elevators must be
installed to carry passengers between the platform and street sur
face a distance varying usually from so to 100 feet
with the attending cost and delay and the greater difficulty
of properiv ventilating the deep tubes on the other hand
a sjbway built close to the surface of the street
whether by tunneling or in open excavation introduces many complex
difficulties as there are involved the interference with street travel
and the care and at limes extensive reconstruction of otber
dgt google subsurface structures such as sewen ppes oi electric
conduits in boston these difficuitics were avoided in some instances
by tunnekng with the aid of a semicircular shield and
elsewhere reduced a that they were left iti their previous
positions when tuntieling methods were not employed surface travel was
maintained by permitting the contractors to brealc the con tinuity
of the surface during the nigit only the nrst step
was to make an excavation across the street and with
a length of about 12 feet this eicavatioa roofed over
with wood during the day was carried down to the
foundation level and a section of the subway structure built
such an excavation was called a slice after the first
slice was well advanced a second was begun and an
intervening slice interval left undisturbed when a series of alternate
slices were completed the intervening excavation was removed in paris
subway construction was much aided by the width of the
streets and the placing of nearly all subsurface structures beneath
the sidewalks in new york in order to reduce to
the minimum the distance between the platform and street surface
so as to give the shortest flight of steps for
passengers to climb it was planned to build the old
subway regardless of sewers and pipes even though extensive read
justment was necessary a general design of a flat roof
was adopted the top of which was permitted ki come
within 30 inches of the top of the paving a
distance just sufficient to con tain the yokes carrying the
subconduit of the electric surface tramway in order to support
the flat roof with its superincumbent load a steel framework
was devised consisting of horizontal steel beams in the roof
resting on rows of columns between the tracks and verti
cal steel beams at the sides these steel frames were
set at intervals of live feet and provide a series
of supporting ribs between the roof beams and again between
the wall beams arches of concrete were formed the floor
of the structure is also oi concrete reinforced with steel
beams whenever an upward hydrostatic pressure was present at the
sides and immedi ately next to the wall columns were
placed two vertical rows of terracotta ducts into which were
drawn through manholes leading to the street surface the leadcovered
cables to carry the power current for operation in order
to keep moisture from the subway a layer of waleiproofii
material consisting of felt and asphalt was laid in the
floor concrete and then carried up outside of die ducts
and over the roof making a continuous envelope immedi ately
outside of the waterproofing was laid a thin protective wall
of brick in concrete in order to guard it against
damage for the special difficulties incident to the tunnel construction
of the new york subways see tunnels and tun neung
new york rapid transit tunnels the bringing of the subway
close to the sur face necessitated carrying surface traffic during
construction usually by means of temporary bridges and the permanent
readjustment of sub surface structures in the matter of sewerage
this readjusting was done by substituting for a single sewer
in the centre of the street two vats 770 smaller
sewers one on each aide and by car tying cross
sewers in iron pipes beneath the sub way at suitable
points in the matter of water and g mains pneumatic
tubes and electric conduits a complete rearrangement was adopted by
leaving the smaller ones above the roof and placing the
larger ones at the sides a satis factory arrangement of
these subsurface struc tures was a work of great cufficulty
and ex in general the design of this old subw
proved very satisfactory yet in operation cer tain defects developed
which were avoided by the engineers of the dual system
many of the stations of the old subway were built
on curves a considerable space was left between the car
and station platform on these curves which proved a source
of oonstanl danger in rush hours and were the cause
of not a few fatalities moreover it is necessary to
siqw down sooner when approaching a curved plat form than
a straight one and in the rush hours when trains
are operated on short head ways this slowdown tends to
cause congestion at those points of the line where there
are curved platforms the ventilation of the old subway was
defective in that all four tracks were placed in one
tunnel the passage of a train there stirred the air
but did not renew it since the air escaped to
the side of the train and was not propelled ahead
of it to the ex hausts the new subways have
a partition be tween each pair of tracks so that
there is really a tunnel for trains going in the
same direction and one for those going in the op
posite direction bjcceshve heat aeveloped m the old subway in
the summer this is due to friction of wheels brakes
etc and to the op eration of the car motors
the old subway was waterproofed all the way around underneath
at the sides and overheadand this waterproof ing while most
effectively keeping water out prevents radiation and confines the beat
within the tunnel which is augmented by each passing train
less waterproofing characterizes all recent subway instruction on the old
new york subway there are two classes of stations one
for local the other for express trains tne platforms of
the local sta tions are on the outside of the
outer pair of tracks and are readied directly from the
street surface and at these points there is no con
nection with the express the central tracks at the express
stations the local outer tracks are curved outward so as
to permit the con struction of an island platform between
each local and express track the station stairways in this
case are located as before on the side walks and
lead to a ticket oflice beneath the street from which
there leads a bridge passing over the tracks and connected
with both the island platforms by stairs the more import
numerous exits and entrances strait plat forms exclusively are built
on the new hnes the openitigs at subway stations were
assumed to he sufficient to provide for ventilation of the
subways but this proved an error and numer ous openings
were added as well as blowers at congested points sec
new york city the cost of constructing subways is very
great in this respect the new york subway being the
largest ana most complue as yet dgt google 780 conetrtkted
has cost tncluding all work in hand estimated complete about
400000000 this figure includes many miles of surface and elevated
tracks allied with the system and the usual proportion of
water for ftnancing the proposition the most expensive fourtrack section
cost at the rate of nearly 5000000 per mile in
boston 17 miles of subww a part of which was
fourtrack cost 40000 in paris the cost averes for iwotrack
subway about 50000 per mile while in london tubu lar
railways cost about 1500000 per mile without equipment in ail
cases operation as stated above the first sub ways built
in london were worked by steam locomotives all lines subsequently
constructed except one in glasgow have been and are oper
ated by electricity in the exception above noted a cable
was the source of power as the orig inal lines
are now being converted to electrit operation it has become
the sole power now in use the power is generated
in central sta tions b direct driven generators usually of
latfie size the largest central station so far constructed is
the station built to operate the subway in new york
in this station there are eit units which have nominally
5000 kilowatt capacity each and which ttether with sub sidiary
engines represent a total of 132000 bone power the current
as produced is according to the most approved practice of
the threephase altet a transformed and converted rcct current at
a pressure of about 550 volts and as such is
fed to the line the means of delivering the current
to the trains is usually by means of a third
rail set on the floor of the subway and at
a distance of about two feet from one of the
track raits from this rail the furrent is taken by
contact shoes on the motor cars and led to the
motors themselves on some railroads the trains are drawn by
electric locomotives at the head of the train coupled in
the same manner as steam locomotives llie most desirable practice
however is to distribute the power to various cars in
the train so that die weight of the cars and
passengers fnmisfae the necessary track cohesion this method of working
is called the multiple unit system the various motors thus
distributed thraugh the train are controlled from either end of
the train or can be arranged so as to be
controlled at any intermediate point in the new york subway
the most powerfully equiroed cars as yet con structed are
in operation the motor cars have each two 200 horsepower
motors and are adapted so that the egress trains can
be com posed of five to seven motors and three
trailers the total weight of an eightcar train including passengers
standing space occupied as well as seats is about 300
tons the nominal power capacity is therefore six and twothirds
horse power per ton of train or say 10 horse
power per ton of train available during the short period
of acceleration this power capacity is greatly in excess of
european or other american prac tice on account of higher
speed to be reatiied inasmuch as subways are built to
convey large numbers of passengers it becomes necessary that the
cars be run in trains and not in single units
except in the case of boston where the subway was
buik for the passage of the surface trolley cars the
trains vary in length from 2 to 10 cars ownership

boston and paris adopted the srinciple of municipal ownership but
under djf erent methods of application in new york the
dual system was created when the dty through the public
service commission on 19 march 1913 entered into an agreement
with the interborough rapid transit company and the new york
municipal railway corporation the latter a subsidiary of the brooklyn
rapid transit providing for the construction and operation of new
subway lines elevated and subway extensions of existing subways and
third tracldng and extensions of elevated lines the city and
the two companies contributed large sums for the construction of
suhway lines while cost of equipment plus the cost of
construction of elevated extensions and ele vated third tracldng and
other improvemeois was met by the two companies on their
re spective systems despite the substantial con tributions by the
companies to the expense of subwar construction all subways and
elevated extensions of subways are owned by the city while
elevated railroad extensions and third tracking on elevated railroads remain
the prop erty of the companies the dual agreements included
leases to the companies of the lines to be operated
by them and their subsidiaries in boston a commission appointed
on be half of the city constructs the road by
con tracts as cheaply as possible and makes a lease
to the company owning and operating die sur face and
elevated lines at a figure that will at least return
to the city the interest that the dty has to
pay in the case of bojb new york and boston
the profit that the munidpality reaps is the securing of
the construction of rapid transit lines necessary for the development
of the dty in 1918 the boston hierating company found
itself in financial difficiuties due to a variety of causes
and appealed for aid to the slate legisla ture an
act was passed by the latter dody mting a board
of five trustees with power to operate the boston system
and to fix the fare rate for the first six
months of control by the board from 1 july 1918
the success of the experiment was questionable the fare hat
since been increased 100 per cent and agitation for ptahc
operation has decreased proportion ately bostons subway now extends to
all erts of greater boston and to cambridge ass in
paris the dty arranged with a corporation especially organized for
the purpose the leasing of all lines hat the dty
of paris might build the company to pay to the
city onethird of the gross recdpts and in addition to
furnish the equipment which will become the property of the

is not secured against loss as in the case of
new york und boston but on the other band being
practi cally a partner in the enterprise it can secure
a direct monetary profii provided the roads are profitable in
their operation which have so far been found to be
