portable form may be classed as hand weapons as distinguished
from ordnance in their earliest forms small arms do not
differ from cannon except in siie these weapons dating from
the 14th century were suspended from the neck of the
trooper this cavalry weapon known as the bombardello was succeeded
by the hand culverin mounted on a wooden stodc and
fired from a rest by a slovnnatch it took two
men to fire it and except or the terror caused
by its noise was a far less effective weapon than
the crossbow the stock and barrel gradnally took on a
form not unlike the present one and the slowmatch was
fastened to a serpentine or cock on the piece this
was manipubted by a lever or spring and transferred the
fire from a match on the barrel to a flapan
containing powder and situated just under the touchhole this piece
known as the matchlock was partly superseded in 1515 by
the wfaeellock in which the trigger rdeased a clockwork which
rotated a grooved metal wheel against a piece of pyrites
or flint thus igniting the iriming the wheellock was too
expensive for military purposes and was con fined to fowling
pieces which it first made reaaonably convenient the flmtlock originated
in spain about 1600 though it did not come into
general military use till nearly a century later the priming
wat ignited by the contact between a flint held in
a frame not unlike die serpentine of the match lock
and the cover of the flashpan the flint lock was
the prevailing arm as late as 1840 it was almost
mvariably muzileloading as a sumed the forms of pistol smooth
bore musket and rifle the rifle dates back almost to
the beginning of the history of firearms and is characterized
by helical grooving on the inside of the barrd this
secures against the escape of gas past the bullet and
gives a predetennined axis of spin to the bullet thus
increasing the accuracy of fire in 1807 a scotch clergyman
by the name of forsyth patented the use of fulminates
for the ignition of the charge in firearms this grad
ually came to be adopted in place of the flint
lock the mechanism was much like that of the flintlock
the flint was replaced by a metal hammer and the
flashpan and touchhole by a nipple containing a metal cap
of fulminate the reinvention of the breechloader for the breechloader
in a primitive form is as old as the gun
itself todt place soon afterward the first military rifle was
the needlegun of the prussians invented by dreyse in 1839
it was a crude bolt action weapon with very imperfect
obturation as a paper cartridge was used the french soon
followed suit first with the ta batiire and then with
the chassepot in 1666 the british adopted the snider rifle
remodeled from the old enfield the martini falliiw block rifle
was adopted in 1871 in 1872 the mauser boltaction rifle
was made the ann of the german army this gun
is the type of most modem military rifles during this
period the amtnnnitioa under google shall arms round buuet was
replaced by onecyliiutroconical in shape and the cartridge case of
paper gave way to one first of coiled brass and
then of drawn brass this made escape of kas impos
sible and solved the problems which had vexed the inventors
of breechloading arms from the 15th century on the magazine
principal grad ually came into use first in the form
of a tube magazine now retained only by the french
lebel then of a box under the action and finally
of a box loaded with five or six cart ridges
at once by a clip or charger the calibre was
then reduced to the neighborhood of 3 inches or less
and a muzzle velocity of over 1800 feet per second
was attained this was made possible by the invention of
the copper jacketed nonatripping bullet by uagtor rubin of the
swiss army soon afterward smokeless ader was introduced and the
military rifle assumed practically all its present features the krjorgeiisen
and springfield mentioned below are typical military arms for many
years after the arrival of the early colonists imported weapons
were used in america almost exclusively on the continent especially
among the germans swiss and french much attention bad been
given to the production of aims of precision and greater
progress had been made than in ejiglantt the puntan settlers
in new england remained satis fied with their matchlock and
flintlock smooth bore arms until the revolutionary period their traditions
and training were such that the use of deadly weapons
excepting in cases of defeijse from enemies and for uie
purpose of obtaining game in order to sustain life was
frowned on as a practice to be discouraged it is
to the teutonic settlers of pennayn vania that we must
turn for the earliest ex amples of typical american weapons
peter and hdnrich leman established themselves near lancaster pa at
the beginning of the 18th cenrary and in 1732 were
making rifled naturally the first rifles produced were of the
contemporary german model shortbarreled ungainly pieces of large bore they
were flint lock loading from the muzzle a mallei being
necessary in order to start the bullet into the deeply
cut rifling considerable pressure being afterward required in order to
seat the bullet down upon the powder charge the frontiers
men appreciated the value of an arm that gave the
accuracy of which these weapons were ca pable as compared
with smoothbore muskets but such laborious methods of loading were
impracticable under conditions of indian war fare and in the
pursuit of dangerous game so the linen or buckskin patch
impregnated with tallow was devised to be wrapped about the
huuet when loading this seated readily and the rifles were
found to shoot farther and truer than by the previous
method by lengthening ujc barrel greater accuracy as well as
ease of ughting and steadier holding ensued the barrel was
usually from 40 to 4s inches in length octagonal and
of a bore from 35 to 40 round balls to
the pound the stock was made of maple or walnut
extending the full length of the barrel the ramrod being
carried in a slot underneath a cheekpiece was fashioned near
the breech also a patch box and the butt of
the stock terminated in a crescentshaped plate to be held
against the upper arm instead of the shoulder the locks
were generally fitted with i single or double set triggers
the stock was intentionally slender and ught the total weight
of the rifles being about 10 pounds sights were very
low on the barrel consisting of an oval silver blade
at the muzzle and at the breech a straight bar
with a fine notch frequently inlaid with a narrow vertical
strip of silver tluiugh the range of these rifles was
seldom effective beyond 200 yards within that distance great precision
as well as a flat curve of trajectory was secured
the proportion of the weit of the bullet to the
powder charge being about three in the far west a
change in model was made in order to adapt the
rifle to the conditions of buffalo hunting and use on
horseback a rifle of this type made in missouri in
1820 has a 34inch octagonal barrel witii a maple stock
extending half way to the muzzle the bore is slightly
over onehalf inch in diameter and a charge of about
90 grains of powder was used this arm has double
set triggers and weighs about lojs pounds in the south
the standard rifle was of rela still hunting the small
game of the such as wild turkeys and squirrels though
larger calibres were to be found to a certam extent
the kentucky smallbore rifle attained a widespread reputation the sport
of target or turkey shootine from an artificial rest at
distances up to 40 rods developed a type of rifle
which while very accu rate was useless for field purposes
weighing from 20 to 40 pounds a bore of from
40 to 60 calibre was customary with an elongated projectile
and telescope sights were freuenuy applied carlos clark of windsor
vt in 1amp36 adopted the false muzzle for the purpose
of preventing wear on the rifling when loadini and it
was generally used with this style of arm the first
military weapon employed by the united states government was tfie
charleville musket the national arm of france which was brought
to this country in large quantities dur ing the revolutionary
war through the influ ence of marquis de lafayette the
french model of 1763 served as an example for amer
ican private manufacturers who were en couraged by the government
these muskets were heavy smoothbore flintlocks taking an ounce ball
and fitted with bayonets in 1795 the government armory at
springfield mass was established and the manufacture of muskets by
the government was begun during that year the charleville musket
as improved in 1797 continued to be the standard type
of military weapon the harpers ferry armory was es tablished
in 1796 but the fabrication of arms was not begun
until 1801 in 1804 rifles were produced there in small
quantities a rifle re sembhng the sporting model of the
period was brodt out at this armory in isu it
had a halfoctagon barrel short forestock no bayo net and
a curved butt plate and was adapted to a onehalf
ounce ball the hall rifle issued in 1818 was the
first breechloading rifle to be manufactured by the govemmenl it

musket and rifle of the model of 1842 were the
first service weapons to be originally made with percussion locks
during the gvil war a great variety of arms were
in use the percussion irinciple was ap plied to many
of the flintlocks in the possession of the government and
the musket and rifles made in the government aimories were
adafited to that sle of imtiltmi breechloading nfles snd carbines
of private manufacture were pur chased in large quantities several
types of re peating arms doing excellent service foreign weapcuis
were also used to some extent espe cially in the
confederate service at the close of the war the government
deemed it desirable to transform the large num ber of
muzzleloadin rifles on hand into breech loaders many devices for
this purpose were submitted to the ordnance board and that
pre sented by smoat a mechanic at the springfield armory
was adopted and the rifles were known is the model
of 1865 the progress in the development of ammunition resulted
in the pro duction of the rim fire cartridge a
great im provement over the powder and ball charge enclosed
in paper previously in use centre lire cartrics of 58
calibre the brass shell containinb 71 grains of power and
450 of lead became the standard ammunition for the later
nfles of this model in 1868 the calibre was changed
to 50 retaining the same weight of bullet and powder
charge in 1870 the ordnance board recommended for trial from
the many nfles submitted to them the remington sharps and
ward burton all taking the regulation socalibre cartridge they were
all tried in the field the verdict being that none
of them were superior to the spring field a reduction
in calibre was recommended however resulting in the model of
1873 spring field rifle calibre 45 taking 70 grains of
powder and a 405grain bullet in 1885 a bullet weigh
ing 500 grains was adopted as the standard for this
cartridge the 4scalibre leeremington and later the 236caiibre lee straight
jwll rifles both em bodying the bolt mechanism were adopted
for die i7nited states navy flintlock pistols of lare calibre
and smooth bore were considered an indispensable weapmi of defense
during the early history of our country no traveler on
horseback or by stage feeling secure unless one of these
weapons was in his possession accuracjr was a secondary consideration
as they were intended to be used only at short
range and hence were frequently kadcd with buckshot as well
as with single ballets duelling pistols were of a different
model the stocks bng attached at an extreme angle with
the barrel in order to allow the owner to assume
the approved duelling portion with the elbow dose to the
body these pistols were made in pairs and they frequently
snowed a high degree of skill on the part of
the makets being ehiboratcly engraved and inlaid in 1830 samuel
colt began to devote his attentioii to devetoiring a pistol
with a revolv ing cylinder containing a number of chambers
the cylinders were loaded from die muisle with powder and
ball each chamber containing an independent breecnpin adapted to a
percus sion cap these weapons were made with a solid
frame uetatlic cartridges added much to their utility smith and
wesson brout out a revolver with a hinged frame allowing
the chambers to be exposed for loading and the simultaneous
ejecting of the dischaikd shells the products of these two
firms soon became the models for manufacturers throughout the world
for hunting rifles the breediloading system came into general use
during the period of the civil war in the west
the sharps 4scaibre rifle chambered for a cartridge containing frnn
90 to 120 grains of powder and a 550grain bullet
paper patched was the standard buffalo hunters weapon tnese rifles
weied from 11 to 16 poimds and were usually equipped
with set triggers the tnazine principle was making rapid advances
at this time in the henry nfle th predecessor of
the winchester the cartndfcea were loaded into a tube under
the barrel beine forced by a spiral spring into the
carrier and thrown into the chamber by the action of
the lever forming the trigger guard the standard cartridge remained
the at40aoo in both vim and later central fire in
1870 the exprem principle attracted the attention of sportsmen consisting
in the use of a large powtur char in proportion
to the weift of the bullet in order to obtain
a high velocity and increased striking power on large game
the 4590300 cartridge was one of a number broujt out
in response to this demand and adapted to the rgt
peating sysltm of rifles the formation of the national rifle
aesltgt dation in 1871 resulted in a series of inter
national longrange rifie contests in which th american teams won
a majority of the matches both at home and abroad
the weapons used were of 44 and 45 calibre with
from 90 to 120 grains of powder and paper patched
bullets of from 500 to 550 grains of hardened lead
th limit of weight of these rifles was id pounds
and the minimiun trigger pull three pounds great 11 was
shown in the manufacture of these rifles and the results
attained have not been surpassed in accuracy by later develop
ments in weapons target shooting as a sport became popular
throughout the coimtry as a result of these con tests
and as many clubs were unable to obtain facilities for
longrange practice shooting at 200 yards in the standing position
was widely adopted the large bore rifles and heavy enlarges
in use at the longer ranges were found to be
unnecessary and a gradual reduction in calibres took place for
some years the limit of weight remained at 10 pounds
at the ger manamerican schuetienfests there were no re strictions
as to the weight of the rifle or the trigger
pull and these weapons while imprac ticable m oie field
were nevertheless superior for thdr specific purpose hence a change
in tvpe in offhand weapons has come about and the
standard weapon is the schuetien model weighing from 11 to
15 pounds the 32 and 38 calibres are usuallv adopted

qualities and workmanship and served as models for american fowling
pieces barrels and locks were largely imported in fact it
is only within a comparatively few years that many shotgun
barrels have been nude in this country the introduction of
the lefaucheaux breecbloading system from france in 1852 marked a
great advance over previous inventions a paper and brassshell was
used with a small percussion cap in the centre of
the base of the cartridge ignited by the blow of
the hammer on a brass pin extend ing through the
side of the head of each shell this pin also
affording a means for withdrawing the empty case the barrels
were hinged the breech being opened for the insertion of
the shells by means of an under lever this system
formed the basis for most american breech loading actions for

we have men tioned have been developed during the era
of black powder a propellant which while produc ing remarkably
uniform results has changed but ehghtly in its constituents during
the past cen the introduction of smokeless or nitro pow
der has marked new era in the field of fire
arms its characteristic features are absence of smoke and fouling
reduced recoil reduc tion in bulk and the attainment of
high vebd ties with relatively low chamber pressures in military
weapons smokeless powder was at once conceded to possess obvious
advantages during the spanishamerican war smokeless ammunition was made in
targe quantities for the 45calibre springfield rifle the ordnance board
after careful investigation adopted is stilt 1892 the kragiorgensen 30calibre
rifle this arm is of the boltoperated type wds nine
and threefourths pounds without the bay onet and has a
magazine holding live cartridges the cartridge contains a bullet of
230 ains consisting of a lead core and a steel
jacket the charge of smokeless powder giving a muzzle velocity
of 2000 feet per second as compared with 1300 feet
for the 45calibre springfidd a marked reduction of recoil a
flat curve of trajectory and economy in the weight of
am munition as well as a great gain in rapidity
of fire are notable features a 10inch twist is required
to rotate properly the long bullet in 1903 the ordnance
board adopted a new weapon known as the jocalibre springfield
the breech mechanism resembles in many re spects a form
of the mauserbolt action whidi has given excellent satisfaction the
magazine is of the box type and is situated under
the receiver the cartridges are loaded from a clip the
magazine being provided with a cut oft so that the
weapon may be used as a single loader if desired
twenty shots have been fired in government tests in 28j
seconds the cart ridge has a cannelure cut around the
head to engage in the extractor in place of the
flai on tee kragjorgensen ammunition allowing the cartridges to lie
compactly in the magazine the 150grain jacketed bullet is used
the powder charge being increased in order to give a
muzrie velocity of 2700 feet per second the rifle weighs
without bayonet 869 pounds and is 360 feet long the
bayonet adds one pound in weight and 133 feet in
length in 1917 a rifle of similar dimensions taking the
same cartridge but of a british type was adopted for
use in the great war the telescope sight is receiving
attention for the equipment of mititanf sharpshooters the hyposcope a
detachable instrument con sisting of a series of mirrors in
a tube ex tending below the line of sight allowing
aim to be taken without the body of the soldier
being exposed has recently been placed before the ordnance board
for adoption in hunting rifles the jacketed bullet and smokeless
powder have found instant favor for this purpose the lead
core of the bullet ifl exposed at the point and
upon striking game it expands or mushrooms making a most
deadly wound though the 3040 government cartrie with a soft
nosed bullet is largely used a number of spedal cartridges
have been designed the 405 winchester aoapted to thdf repeating
rifles contains a 300grain bullet the smokeless powder charge developing
a muzzle velocity of 2204 feet per second and a
ffluxile energy of 3235 foot pounds ine application of smokeless
powder to re volver ammunition has resulted in increased efficiency
as an unlimited number of shots may be fired with
no perceptible fouling of the bar rel or qrlinder and
a degree of accuracy main tained which was unattainable in
die days of black powder shotgun cartridges are almost exclusively
loaded with this propellant and american tna dy google shalxjey
suallfox cfunemade guns are now being produced in wobfats of
from six to seven pounds without the recoil becoming excessive
or general effec tiveness being sacrificed the imported twist barrels
have given way to special steel barrels of light weight
and great tensile streith automatic hrearms have within the past
few years attracted much attention the term automatic literally means
an ann that con tinues its acts of loading and
firing after the first shot until the ammunition is exhausted
the arm that after firing the first shot per forms
the work of ejectrng the emp shell recharses the chamber
and leaves the arm ready for the next shot by
merely pressing the trigger is a semiautomatic firearm but the
term automatic has been generally applied to this weapon there
are two systems in vogue at present that by which
a portion of the gas from the explosion is utilized
to operate the breech mechanism the other in whiui the
bar rel recedes by the action of the recoil and
accomplishes the same result the latter sys tem has been
successfully applied to american repeating pistols which are a marked
improve ment over the revolver as in the latter there
is an inevitable escape of the explosive gases between the
cylinder and the barrel metal jacketed bullets and smokeless do
wder are used on these repeating pistols smallbore rifles designed
on the recoiloperated system are a popular weapon and a
repeating semiautomatic shotgun is now before the pubhc see machimk

origin a smallpox as is the case with other similar
dis eases has not been definitely established the probabilities are
that it made its first appear ance in the orient
and was thence introduced into western europe a severe epidemic
of smallpox is said to have occurred in iceland in
134 we have no trustworthy record how ever or the
disease before the 15th century when it began to appear
in europe epidemics became progressively more common in the 6th
and 17th centuries and reached their maximum of frequency and
extent in the 18th century for official data concerning the
disease in the 17th and i8th centuries wc are chiefly
indebted to the london bills of mortality which ve a
weekly account of burials and christenmgs and from 1629 to
1845 the specific causes ot death including smallpox it has
been estimated that the population of london in 1685 was
530000 the mortality from smallpox for an average of 10
years from 1681 to 1690 was over three in a
thou sand in most of the years of the century
indeed the mortality was in the neighborhood of two in
a thousand sometimes more and al other times less this
would mean an aver age of over 1000 smallpox deaths
in london a year as it has been reckoned that
about one in five would die there were evidently abont
5000 cases of smallpox annually in the english capital as
will be readily comprehended smallpox was a great scourge before
the days of vac cination but a small percentage of
people es caped its ravages indeed smallpox was as prevalent
in the 18lh century as measles is at the present
time haygarth gives an account of an epidemic of smallpox
m chester eng land in 1774 at which time out
of a popula tion of 14713 1202 persons took the
disease and 202 died at the termination of the ei
demic there were but 1060 persons or 7 per cent
of the population who had never had smallpox in 1722
smallpox devastated the small english town of ware whose popula
tion numbered 2515 souls of this number there were only
914 persons susceptible to smallpox google loe sual inasmuch as
1601 liad already passed througb an attack of the disease
during the epidemic referred to 612 persons were attacked leaviag
but 302 individuals in the entire town who had never
had smallpox ejghtyfive per cent of the population therefore were
smallpox sur with these official figures in mind we may
be better able to appreciate the general esti mate of
the extent of smallpox given by writers of the dw
in 1802 admiral berkeley in a speech before the house
of commons said lt is proved that in this united
kingdom alone 45000 persons die annually of the small pox
but throughout the world what is it not a second
is struck by the hand of time but a victim
is sacrificed upon the altar of that most horrible of
all disorders the smallpox king frederick william iii of prussia
in a dispatch dated 1803 stated that 40000 people succumbed
annually to smallpox in his kingdom the french minister of
the interior in reporting on vaccination in 1811 estimated that
150000 people died in france annually from smallpox the disease
is reported to have destroyed in russia 2000000 lives in
a single year the distinguished mathematician daniel bemouilte writing in
1760 to t76s calculated that not less than 15000000 human
beings died of smallpox every 25 years this would give
a yearly aver age of 600000 dr lettsom estimated that
europe alone claimed 210000 victims aunually juncker placed the yearly
sacrifice from small pox in europe at 400000 when to
these figures are added the deaths due to devastating epi
demics in asia africa and america the esti mate of
bernouille does not appear to be over stated smallpox was
introduced in the western hemisphere by the spaniards about 15
years after the discovery of america in mexico within a
short period 3500000 persons are said to have died of
the disease it is alleged that in mexico smallpox has
exterminated whole tribes of indians sparing no one to tell
the story of the annihilation robertson refers to smallpox among
the south american indians as follows la consequence of this
various calamities together with the introduction of smallpox a malady
unknown in america and extremely fatal to the natives the
number of people both in new spain and peru was
so much reduced that in a few years the accounts
of their ancient population appeared almost incredible catlin states that
of 12000000 american indians 6000000 fell victims of smallpox washington
irvings astoria makes mention of terrible epidemics of smallpox among
the indians in which almost entire tribes were destroyed lloyd
who translated prince maximilians travels in the interior of north
america states in the preface in refer ence to a
smalluox epidemic among the in dians in 1837 the bigbellied
indians and the ricarees lately amounting to 4000 souls were
reduced to less than the half the as siniboins 9000
in number are in the literal sense of the expression
nearly exterminated according to records published by the gov ernment
of denmark a devastating epidemic of smallpox appeared in iceland
in 1707 which destroyed 18000 out of the 50000 inhabitants
36 per cent of the total population perished it is
stated on good authority that in the danish colony of
greenland in 1734 6000 to 7000 persons perished from smallpox
representing nearly twothirds of the population the dis ease was
introduced by a danish ip the natives of new england
likewise suf fered great losses by smallpox robertson writes at
the same time 1631 the smallpox a distemper fatal to
the people of the new world swept such multitudes of
the natives that some whole tribes disappeared n 1752 boston
had a severe epidemic of this dread disease the population
of boston at that time was 156 of this number
5998 had previously had smallpox during the epidemic 5545 persons
conttracted the disease in die usual manner and 2124 took
it by inoculation ejgh teen hundred and fortythree people escaped
from the town to avoid the danger of infec tion
there were therefore left in the city but 174 people
wtio had never had smallpox the population at the end
of the epidemic prac tically consisted of persons who had
survived an attack of this fearinspiring malady smallpox was essentially
a disease of chil dren in former times to such
an extent was this true that the disease was called
kinds pocken childpox or kindsblalterti owing to the pronounced contagiousness
of the dis ease and the almost universal susceptibility to
it smallpox was largely contracted during child kfe as measles
is at the present time but comparatively few adults contract
measles at the present day because they are protected by
a previous attack in infancy or childhood the same conditions
obtained with relation to small pox in the days before
vaccination the adult population represented mostly the survivors from smallpox
in childhood it was estimated that less than 6 per
cent of persons were naturally insusceptible to the disease vac
cination has totally changed the age period of smallpox it
is now excessively rare for a successfully vaccinated child under
five years of age to die of the smallpox it
is even uncom mon for a successfully vaccinated child under
10 years of age to die of the disease as
was adequately proved in the testimony presented before the british
royal commission on vac cination sraallpox perhaps more than any
other disease has inspired fear and terror in the popular
mind because of its loathsome ap pearance its extreme contagiousness
and its disfiring consequences lord macaulay writing of the untimely
death from smallpox in 1694 of the young and beautiful
queen mary of england gives us a powerful pen picture
of the ravages of this pestilence that dis ease over
which science has since achieved a succession of glorious and
beneficent victories was then the most terrible of all of
the min isters of death the havoc of the plague
has been far more rapid but the plague has visited
our shores only once or twice within living memory and
the smallpox was always present filling the churchyards with corpses
tormenting with constant fears all whom it had not yet
stricken leaving on those whose lives it spared the hideous
traces of its power turning the babe into a changeling
at which the mother shuddered and making the eyes and
cheeks of the betrothed maiden objects of horror to the

of a classic attack of smallpox suffers from a pronounced
chill followed by sudden fever and severe backache nausea and
vomit ing occur with great frequency and tbe latter may
persist for several days diuiness and general aches and pains
are common in severe cases there is great wemess and
prostration during this sta while the symptoms may be most
suggestive of smallpox no positive diagnosis can be made as
the grip and cer tain other infections may imitate the
early symptoms of smallpox not until the eruption appears can
one be absolutely sure of the nature of the disease
many persons are commonly exposed to smallpox before the diagnosis
can be definitely established eruptive stagabout the third day of
the illness the fever abates the pains subside and the
patient begins to feel that his illness is at an
end but he is woefully mistaken for it has hardly
begun at this time the eruption makes its first appearance
it is not formidable at first sight and looks not
unlike a multitude of fleabites on the face hands and
elsewhere soon it spreads over the greater part of the
body from day to day the eruption under goes a
change soon the face is covered with numerous pustules the
features are swollen beyond their normal proportions and the patient
disfigured bond recognition the fever again rises and acquires the
characteristics of blood poison fever the patient suffers greatly from
tbe soreness occasioned by the multitude of pustules present particularly
those on the hands tbe presence of smallpox sores in
the nose and mouui causes reat difficulty in breathing and
great distress in swallowing m plagae of boiu at about

he has passed smallpox in its usual form is a
terrible disease and there is an almost universal sus ceptibility
of the human family to its infection but there is
no malady against which science k assesses a surer and
more complete safeguard or that great discovery the world is
indebted to edward jenner like all other infectious diseases smallpox
varies in severity and fatal ly in different epidemics one
of the most virulent outbreaks occurred after the franco pnissian
war in 1871 this became a veritable pandemic spreading over
the entire civiliied world and destroying the lives of hundreds
of thousands of persons in other epidemics the type of
the disease nu be much less virulent and may be
characterized by a lower mortality rate since 1896 there has
been widely prevalent in the united states a peculiarly mild
type of smallpox which kills only a very small propor
tion of those attacked hundreds of thousands of such cases
have occurred throughout the country this mild type is doubtless
due to the weakness of the infecting germ two entirely
different types of smallpox have prevailed in america one the
virulent imported variety which destroys the lives of onequarter of
those whom it attacks and the other the mild type
above referred to an interesting feature of the latter type
is that it is not only mild as to mortality
out also as to its contagiousness practically it attacks only
the un vaccinated while vaccinated persons even if the vaccination
dates back 30 or more years are as a rule
protected against it the opponents of vaccination point to this
mild type of smallpox and say that the disease has
lost its terrors those who are thoroughly familar with the
subject however know that neglect of vaccination may prepare trpei
of smallpox the most malignant nd fatal type of smallpox
is that known as hemorrhagic or black smallpox in this
fomu the patient is overwhelmed with the poison antl succumbs
to it before the charactenstic erup tion is enabled to
appear instead of the usual eruption bkxtd spots occnr on
the sidn and the patient dies in one two or
three days this malignant type i more prone to occur
during virulent epidemics and appears diiefly in pregnant women men
addicted to alcohol and in those debilitated from various causei
confluent smallpox is a severe form of the disease in
which the vesicles and pustules run together and cover extensive
areas of the sldn surface in discrete smallpox the pustules
are separated hy areas of skin free of eruption the

studley niece to charles the proud duke of somerset smithson
seems himself to have observed no reticence about what he
ihout the true facts of bis birth but the name
of made appears to have been imposed upon him from
his youth by his parents and his feeling that he
must create for himself a posi tion which his birth
had denied htm is per haps a reason for his
subsequent bequest to the united states of the means which
founded the institution bearing his name which he had bter
assumed and which was the family name of sir hu
smithson the first duke of northumberland it cannot but be
supposed that something of this kind was in his mind
when he wrote my name shall live in the memory
of man when the titles of the north umberlands and
the percys are extinct and for gotten nothing material is
remembered of his life at oxford where he entered under
the name of uade as a gentleman commoner in 1782
thou he appears to have been partly occupied in chemistry
which was the scientific interest of his later life and
this at a time when the study of physical sdence
was almost unknown in the university he was graduated at
pembroke college with the degree of master of arts in
1786 aiid was admitted as a fellow of the royal
society in the following year on the recom mendation of

prof f w clarke gives the following view of the
value of smithsons sdentific work to theory smithson contributed little
if anything but from a theoretical point of view the
tone of his writings is singularly modem his work was
mostly done before dalton had announced the atomic jicory and
yet smithson saw clearly that a law of definite proportions
must exist although he did not attempt to ac count
for it his ability as a rcasoncr is best shown
in his paper upon the kirkdale bone cave which penn
had sought to interpret by reference to the noachian deluge
a clearer and more complete demolition of penns views could
hardly be written today smithson was gentle with his adversary
but none the less thorough for all his moderation he
is not to be dasscd among the leaders of sdentific
thought but his ability and the usefulness of his contributions
to knowledge cannot be doubted an importaht ore of zinc
was named smith sonite after him that he held a
high place among his con temporaries is evident from the
fact that the president of the royal society in a
necrology for the year 1829 associated the name of smith
son with those of wollaston young and davy sagting that
he was distinguished by the inti mate friendship of mr
cavendish and rivaled our most expert chemists in elegant analyses
he was then most noted in this connection and exhibited
an industry the more creditable to him since be was
at this time a man of large means of smithsons
later fife little is known but his declining years appear
to have been tried by painful infirmities he lived in
these years prindpally in paris and genoa and one gathers
from his letters and from the uniform consideration with which
he speaks of others and from kind trails which he
showed the impression of an innately gentle nature but also
of a man who was renoundng not widiout bit terness

of the library of congress 50 sets a number since
increased to 100 of all government pub lications and in
1889 a treaty was entered into between the united states

of the service while not having a large space in
the public eye has been of great convenience to scientific
men of use in derel oping the libraries of this
country and indi rectly has stimulated scientific research and publicatioii
since by relieving scientific socie ties and individuals of the
expense of exchange ing their own publications it has set
large sums ofmoney tree for research during the war in
europe it became necessary to suspend ship ments to about
10 c early in the history of the institution whose
first publication in the series contributions to knowledge was on
ancient monuments in the mississippi valleyj by squier and davis
in its present form the work of the bureau was
gt3mmenced in 1872 by maj j w powell at he
request of the commissioner of indian affairs wbo desired trustworthy
information concerning the affinities of the indian tribes in 1879
the bureau was definitely organized under the direction of the
smithsonian institu tion and major powell was made director serving
in thai capacity until his death in 1902 the bureau
has engaged in researches in the languages habits customs tribal
organizations google smithsonite shokb government myths and ceremonies of the
american indians and it is proposed to sum marize this
material in a cyclopedia of amer ican indians it has
also issued the voluminous publications already alluded to which contain
information of importance with regard to the political dealings of
the united states govern ment with the indian tribes in
addition re searches are conducted among the natives of abtrophyaical
observatory the astro physical observatory was established in 1890 under
the immediate direction of the present secretary it has been
devoted in the main to researches in regard to that
invisible portion of the solar spectrum which lies beyond the
limit of the red this work first rendered possible by
mr langleyls invention of the bolometer has been carried still
further resulting in a great map of the infrared solar
spectrum com pleted in 1899 which extends our knowlete of
the spectrum to many times that known to newton it
is believed that these studies will erove of great practical
importance since they ave to do with that region of
the spectrum wiiich includes the greater portion of the en
ergy of the sun which throih its heat affects climate
and crops important expeditions were sent out in 1900 and
1901 to observe the total solar eclipses of those years
and especially valuable results were obtained at that of 1900
including photographs of the solar corona of unexampled size and
excellence an expedi tion was planned to enlarge the work
of meas uring solar radiation by establishing a station in
south america owing to war conditions this has been stationed
temporarily at hump mountain n c 1917 national zoolotical park
the national zoological park was established by congress in 1890
at the initiative of the present secretary to secure the
preservation of such american animals as are upon the vere
of extinction and also for the pleasure and instruction of
the people the park is situated upon rock creek two
miles north of the centre of the city and has
an area of 167 acres being four times as large
as the zoological garden at london it is amply supplied
with water and its surface is of a varied and
picturesque character the col lection comprises 1235 animals mostly ameri

summing up what has been said about the smithsonian institution
we see that it occupies the exceptional position of a
ward of the gov ernment its regents expending its own
income which is largely supplemented by direct govern ment grants
for its museum and other bureaus while through its extended
system of pubiica tions its library and its means for
encouraging research and diffusing knowledge through a body of over
30000 correspondents abroad and approximately half that number at home

by state legis latures and ordinances by municipal bodies but
these enactments have only been partially successful there are many
practical difficulties in the way of consuming smoke but experience
has shown that none of them are insuoerable the principle
involved is that of mixing air with the combustible vapors
and gases gener ated by the action of heat on
the fuel so that by virtue of a due supply
of oxygen at the correct temperature they may be made
to burn with flame and become entirely converted into incombustible

still more important ad vantage that weight for weight they
are much mote powerful than black gunpowder in con sequence
of this we not only by their use are able
to impart higher velocities to our pro jectiles and thus

he tested the properties of his newlydiscovered mercuric fubninate and
found hat though this violent agent produced little smoke imparted
a low velocity to the projectile and but a slight
reooll to the piece it burst the chamber and demon
strated its unfitness to compete with gunpowder as a ballistic
agent though it has found a limited use when mixed
with solid diluents which act as restrainers in ammunition for
parlor rifles and it is noticeable that when firing this
ammunition there is little smoke and a scarcely audible report
attending the dis charge ttie next step was taken when
soon after the discovery of guncotton in 1845 attonpts were
made to use this material in its fibrous condition as
a propellent these experiments were made in germany france and
ejigland while a ven extended series were carried on by
major mordecai of the united states army at the washington
arscncl but the material owing to its fibrous form and
the imperfection in its manufacture proved too brisant and too
irrular in action and it was so unstable as o
undergo dangerous decomposition in storage so that it was not
adopted the material had however been proved to possess so
many valu able qualities that it continued to be the
subject of study by many chemists and especially baron von
lck of austria and sir frederick abd of england the
latter devising a method of purification by reducing the guncotton
to a pulp or dust besides affording a means for
the better washing of the guncotton this pulverulent condidon permitted
of the dust being formed into grains and a patent
was issued to abel in 1866 for the production of
powder by agitating this pulp in a vibrating vessel with
or without a binding material whereby the pulp was fonned
into granules of different sizes which were subsequendy sorted the
grains thus pro duced were quite soft easily crushed when
dry and readily absorbed water in 1882 reid and johnson
of england improved the process by moistening the dried grains
with a volatile solvent which on evaporation left the surfaces
so hardened as lo better resist crushing and the absorption
of water from the atmosphere during this dme superficially hardened
soft grained powders composed of mixtures of dif ferent cellulose
nitrates or nitrolignins to gether with unnitrated material and nitrates
such as sodium or barium nitrates came into use as
smokeless sporting powders under the names among others of schultze
c bracketts j d and american wood powders these powders
were from the method of their manufacture quite bulky and
are therefore also classified as bulk powders in 1886 vielle
in france produced the first military smokeless powder of the
modem class by gelatinizing a mixture of cellulose nitrates only
or these mixed with barium and potas sium nitrates as
oxidants and sodium carbonate as a neutralizer with etheralcohol or
some other solvent when the solids and the solvents were
intimately mixed and gelatinization was complete the plastic mass was
rolled out into sheets cut into strips and dried bv
which a dense powder which was hardened throughout was produced
this powder was staled paudre b when it consisted of
cellulose nitrates only or poudre bn when it consisted of
these nitrates mixed with the inoanic salts named above in
1888 nobel in france discovered that by the aid of
camphor or benxine he could effect the solution of as
much as 40 per cent of nitrocotton in nitroglycerin forming
a plastic mass which when rolled out into sheets and
dried formed a mass resembling india rubber this was cut
in blocks or strips or flakes and was known as
ballistile as adopted in italr the plastic mass was squirted
through spaghetti lubcnines forming cords which were cut into the
desired length and the powder in this form was known
as pilite in 1889 abel and dewar in england made
a plastic mass from nitroglycerin nitrocottoii gimcotton and tannin dextrine
or vaseline and as it was made up into cords
it was called cordite in making this powder the gejatiniia
tion was effected by using acetone as a solvent the
mixture being kneaded to a dough in a wa terjacketted
kneading machine ine gelatin iied mass was compacted in a
mold by a prelun inary press and the mold transferred
to a spa ghetti machine or stuff press where the

of walsrode germany discovered that gelatinized cellulose nitrate if immersed
in water underwent a kind of coagulation and division into
small lumps which latter was promoted by stirring and he
based upon this a method ot manufacture by which dense
small grained powders that are hardened throughout could be produced

the same result by throw ing his pulped cellulose nitrate

r munroe pointed out that all powders either gunpowders or
smobeless powders made up co that time consisted of mixtures
of different materials even the straight cellulose nitrate powders being
made of mixtures of different nitnogen contents and he set
forth the novel principle of powder making that the finished
powder should consist of a single chemical substance in a
state oi chemical purity and this was realized in the
smokeless powder which he styled indurite and which was lopularly
known as united states naval smokeless powder as made it
consisted only of cellulose nitrate of the highest nitration in
an indurated condibon and resembled ivory it was made in
the form of flakes for small arms and in the
form of macaroni for large calibres the smokeless powlti fot

compendium s and translations though good qarrative have no further
value as a novelist he seems on first sight to
have added nothing to the art of fiction instead of
beginning with richardson and fielding he went back as he
said himself to the loose narrative of le sage which
admitted of digres sions and episodes without number for a
consideration he incorporated into peregrine pickle the memoirs of a
notorious lady of quality he held too closely it is
said further for the highest art to his own experiences
his best known novels are not much more than autobiographies
all this may be granted but there is the other
side in his early years he cultivated versesatire had he

whole length of the animal but tike snails slus frequently
raise their heads and move their tentacles in search of

them selves to the ground by the accumulation of mucus
at the extremity of the tail hardening into a thread

partial to decaying wood upon which they in part feed

shoots of plants and the garden species often inflict considerable
damage upon lettuce celery etc but much less in this

existence to great springs these side canons receive no surface
streams and there is no other explanation of their formation
the springs undermine the rock by removing the soft material
on which it rests the rock falls into the spring
and gradually sinks into its soft bed and thus the
canons are formed often the undermining is on so large

dance the snakes are taken out of the tent and
carried in armfuls by the indian men are placed on
the ground within a circle of sacred meal in front
of a sacred rock here to the accompaniment of prayers
and chants the serpents are sprinkled with the sacred corntneal
until the whole writhing wrig gling mass is completely covered
by the meal the dance concludes by the indian men

tail quills like most species of the family it breeds
northward from the ex treme northern united states to beyond
the arctic circle within the united slates it is widely
distributed during the spring migrating from march to may and
more abundantly iu the fall from september to november it
fre quents open marshes both fresh and sail and is
consequently chieliy an inland bird and is plentiful m the
central west in its southward journey it reaches the west
indies and south america but seems less sensitive to cold
than many of its relatives and individuals sometimes haunt the
vicinity of open springs during the prevalence of severe frosts
both in the late fall and early spring unlike the
bay birds the snipe is mostly solitary and never forms
large flocks night is its chief season of activity when
it flies and migrates and to a great extent feeds
the soft ground in its haunts is probed in all
directions for worms insects larvae and similar creatures which with
snails and slugs are consumed in great quantities when flushed
it utters a loud rather harsh note and flies rapidly
and very irregularly for 20 or 30 yards before setting
a direct course during the mating and nesting season these
birds are much about by day and are said to
perform remark able aerial evolutions often dropping swiftly from a
height with a peculiar drumming sound caused by the air
rushing through the wings the nest is a mere depression
in the ground lined by a few grasses or leaves
usually in the shelter of a tussock or bush in
a bog the eggs are four and of the pyriform
shape usual in the family and grayisholive tinged with brown
and blotched with browns the snipe is justly a favorite
gamebird and presents qualities which fully test the skill of
the sportsmail its habits and haunts are so easily affected
by weather and other conditions that an intimate knowledge of
its peculiarities are necessarv first to find and then to
approach the snipe on windy stormy days these birds are
extremely wild and their senses are so keen that an
unskilled gunner will see only their jerky 6ight in the
distance on such occasions leave the dog at home and
approach the birds from the windward side with a strong
shooting gun as they always rise toward the wind some
good shots may be afforded before the birds get well
started on warm murky days they lie close and a
welltrained setter or spaniel is necessary to flush them especially
if they be scarce it is of course necessary to
work against the wind but when the dog marks the
gunner will do well to work to windward in order
to get a quartering shot when the bird rises the
erratic flight of this bird in starting is very disconcerting
to a novice and the best plan is to wait
until it has steadied before shooting as a table bird

it into rain over the circumpolar region pei petua snow
covers the earth to the defith of many feet and

the northern portion of the temperate zones and extending equatorward
from 80 to about 45 snow commonly covers the ground
continuously during the winter months and serves a most useful
purpose in the econ omy of nature in protecting vegetation
and the earths surface from the intense cold of winter
owing to many causes both meteorological and topographical the amount
of snowfall varies greatly at different locahties even as regards
those situated upon the same parallels of lati tude upon
the tops of high mountains whether these be situated within
the frigid temperate or tropical zones snow falls inter mittently
throughout each year and above a certain height upon them
called the snowline remains permanently covering the summits owing to

crystalline and the granular the latter some times occurs as
a distinct formation by itself but more frequently as an
accretion depositea by mist or by clouds laden with minute
rain drops upon the crystalline varieties while these are passing

a tendency to divide into six due to me fact
that snow crystals belong to the hexagonal system of crystallization
the majority of snow crystals assume forms which by virtue
of outline structure or general characteristics may be grouped into
two principal classes the columnar and the tabular those comprising
the former class are all such as appear in the
form of hexa gonal columns long slender needleshaped crystals or
columns tapering at one end the tabular snowcrystals develop upon
an ex tremely thin tabular plane whether they pos sess
open or solid structure or both combined these two principal
types often combine tabti lar crystals forming upon one or

segmentary semtlance to tabular or columnar forms the various types
of snow crystals do not occur with equal frequency or
form an equal bulk of the lota snowfall the tabular
crys tals and especially those of an open branchy structure
appear the most frequently and the others in the following
order tabular crjtals possessing solid nuclei granular snow minute irregular
subcrystalline varieties solid tabular hexagons columnar crystals compound crys tals
the columnar crystals vary much less than do the tabular
ones such variations as occur being chiefly those relating to
their dimensions rather than their structure or aspect the com
pound crystals exhibit a much greater variety of form and
structure the connecting bar varies greatly in both length and
thickness in the same and in different snowfalls the tab
ular crystals attached to one or both ends of the
columnar bar also vary greatly at different times both as
regards size outline and struc ture and these variations often
apply to the tabular crystals attached to the same bar
com monly whenever the connecting bar is ex tremely short
one of the tabular crystals at tached lo its ends
will greatly exceed the other in size and as a
result the compound crystal resembling a cuffbutton in shape is
practi cally converted for purposes of descent into a tiny

far the larger part of the total snowfall the varia
tions of outline structure internal ornamenta tion etc of the
individual crystals of this class both in the same and
in different snow falls are all but infinite no written
descrip many of them it far transcends that of the
crystals of any other mineral sjecies they occur in three
principal subdivisions and the frequency of the occurrence of each
is in the following order i those of a wholly
open structure branchy 2 tliose possessing nuclei of a dose
structure surrounded by growths of an open nature 3 those
whose structure is wholly close solid owing to various un
favorable coniitions as violent winds and the collisions and fractures
due lo these develop ment proceeding while they are in
motion as in falling or while they are in close
juxta position and to other unknown causes the majority of
the crystals of snow fail to attain perfect symmetry in
all their parts commonly the nuclei outline a minute star
a hexagon or form compound a circle the number of
snowstorms deposit ing large numbers of beautiful and symmetrica crystals
at a given locality in the northern part of the
united states during any one winter does not usually exceed
16 and may not exceed eight the great majority of
the more perfect and beautiful crystals usually emanate from the
clouds of the western southwestern or north western segments of
great storms in general similar tiies of crystals occur in
most storms within corresponding segments of each due to some
law of general distribution each cloud stratum the tiigh the
low and the interme diate and the temperatures airpressures etc
corresponding with each seem to favor the for mation of
a certain type of crystal the low clouds give large
branching crystals the high clouds small compact ones the intermediate
clouds mediumsized crystals in form a com posite of the
kw and high types the feature of chief interest and
importance concerning the internal structure of the crystals is the
occurrence therein of minute inclusions of air and airtubes these
appear by trans mitted light as dark lines or shadings
etc be cause of the absorption interference or refrac tion
of the rays of light that strike or pass through
them the beautiful and usually sym metrical arrangement of these
airtubes and compartments impart to this type of crystal its
principal charm these airinclusions are of great interest because of
the great number of distinct and varied inclusions mat often
appear within the same and within different individual crystals and
also because it may be assumed that they were not
formed in regular progress ive order but in intertniltent order
from the nuclei outward while each new and distinct outgrowth

issued by the united states weather bureau entitled studies among
the snow crystals winter of 1902 these photo graphic studies
in connection with the meteor ological ones made simultaneously have
greatly ig v google snowball snowbound increased our knowledge of
these most interest ing crystal forms the manner in which
the snow crvstau form is this they crystallize in a
liquid the air of small density which is often in
a siateof asitation where the crystals are forming and whose
degree of density humidity etc is ever changing and usually
among a multitude of uncongealed or uncrysiallizcd particles of vapor
called cloud the commonly accepted theory is that these visible
cloudparticles unite to form the true snow crystals this is
doubt less true in so far as the granular varieties
are concerned but the true crystalline varieties probably form krcct
from the invisible waier mokcules floating in the air before
these unite to form the vastly larger cloudparticles it is
possible that the cloudparticles are essentially the dross residue or
excess of moisture left over during the process of crystalbuilding
a portion at least of this residue or excess of
moisture ascends and is congealed in the upper air into
the semblance of minute snowcrystals appearing in the fonn of
the cirrus cloud above and often around all storms of
great duration or magnitude many occurrences are on rec ord
of snowfalls occurring from skies clear or nearly free from
visible clouds and this lends additional weight to this theory
so very light are many of the snowcrystals especially while
they are in a nuclear or uncompleted state and so
strong are the expanding uprushing aircur rents within many portions
of great storms that it must be assumed that many
crystals are wafted upward perhaps repeatedly and ac quire growths
at greater altitudes than that wherein the nuclei originated before
they at tain sufficient weight to fall to earth doubt
less the multitudinous changes of form and structure that many
of the crystals undergo withii the clouds during growth are
due to these many vertical and horizontal flights within the
clouds and to the great and ever changing variety of
meteonolocal and other conditions prevailing therein each of which im
presses its espedal condition upon them the production and deposition
of the snow occurring as it does over so large
a portion of the earths surface are phenomena of great
magnitude and importance snow not only dtanges the whole aspect
of nature but it also serves many useful purposes it
conserves the beat of the earth and protects vegetation from
the intense cold of winter and even in northern regions
where deep snows occur it is not considered a serious
impediment to travel or commerce a track once made the
compacted snow affords an excellent roadbed over which heavy loads
of merchandize can be easily and quickly transported on sleis
but while in the abstract its manifestations are beneficent in
the concrete some of them are otherwise much damage often
results from the great inundations caused by the sudden melting
of deep snow over large areas and its sudden ac
cumulation to great depths often causes a tem porary blockade
of railroad service and travel in general a large fall
of damp snow or sleet sometimes accumulates so heavily upon
tele graph and telephone poles and wires and upon the
limbs and smaller trees of the forests that they break
under the great weight snowslides from ihe steep sides of
mountains occur and bury and destroy whole vitlairea al together
the snow fills a most important place in natures plan
not only is it beautiful in itself composed of the
most graceful crystal forms that occur in nature but it
plays an im portant part in beautifying earth and sl
for the measurement of snowfall is often a mailer of
considerable difficulty on account of the drifting caused by the
winds various types of gauges are used to collect the
snow fall over a given area and measure the amount
of water formed by its melting hollow tubes are used
to gather and weigh fallen snow so that the total
amount of snow over a given area may be estimated

not attached to the snowshoe at all when the heel
is raised in walking the snowshoe is not lifted but

powder manufactured from to bacco and used for chewing and
for inhaling through the nose for the manufacture of the
finest grades of snuff only the choicest por tions of
fine leaf are used but for the ordinary gonmiercial brands
the thick stemmy portions the midrib and scrap tobacco are
employed the making of snuff is one of the most
intri cate processes for which the tobacco leaf is used
the peculiar aroma and fragrance in snuff are obtained iw
a species of fermentation induced in the leaf by packing
it moist in large quantities and subjectink the mass to
a high temperature snuff is either moist or dry the
details in manufacture differing only in re rard to the
amount of moistening unttergone the moist snuffs are known as
rappees and the dry under various names the varieties known
as irish scotch and sweet snuff being common the manufacture
of french rappee has been brought to a high degree
of excellence by the french government which owns large factories
the tobacco is subjected to two processes of fermentation whereby
aroma and slrenh are acquired and the nicotine and organic
acids re moved the leaves and stalks moistened with salt
water to prevent putrefaction are pressed into cakes and sliced
and left in open chambers for five or six months
to ferment and develop aroma the temperature at times reaching
140 f after that time the tobacco is ground in
mills out of contact with air in order to pre
serve the aronv nd the powder rap sec is after
damping conducted to closed wooden chambers to undergo during 10
months the sec ond fermentation which imparts strength to the
snuff during this fermentation the temperature is kept at from
120 to 130 f and the snuff is frequently repacked
to ensure uniformity finally tne snuff is gathered from the
ferment ing rooms into one large chamber where it matures
for one month it is then ready for stamping into
casks the machinery used in snuff is very commonly adulterate
increase its bulk or pungency durmg its man ufacttire various
flavoring sauces and waters are used for dampening both the
leaves and the lapi sec and in this way the
flavor of the finished snuff is eltecied the processes of
manufacture occupy about 18 to 20 months and in this
timc by the repeated fermentations about twodiirds of the nicotine
is destroyed the acids malic and citric are destroyed and
the acetic sdds and bases evolved leave free a in
the snuff this with the slightly dtine and the aromatic
pungents are de sired qualities the scotch and other dry
snuffs are commonly slightly adulterated with quidc bme which gives
the biting desiccating effect for which they are peculiar snuffs
are scented with musk essences of bergamot lavender attar of
roses tonquinbeans cloves orange flowers jasmines etc the practice of
snufffaking was introduced into europe from america during the 16th
cen tury and during this and the following century became
very general throuout the continent and in england its use
in england greatly in creased under the reign of william
and nnc and in france undn the various louis the
practice although almost entirely abandoned by the upper classes today
is more widely prev alent than is commonly thought the
consump tion of the drug in the british isles is
said to amount to more than 900 tons annually in
the united states where the consumption is about 9500 tons
a year the chief users are foreign born the snuff
used in this country is ail of domestic manufacture the
small amount of french snuff imported not being worth con
sidering the habit of taking snuff is said to be
one of the pleasantest ways of using tobacco the snuff
tiinched up between the thumb and fore finger is drawn
into the nostrils by sharp deep inhalations in a few
moments it produces a ticklish sensation which frequently causes sneezing
and is highly gratifying to the user the habit of
dipping snuff at one time com mon among the poorer
classes in the south atlantic portions of the united states
consisted in holding in the mouth the wellchewed end of
a dry twig which bad been dipped into powdered snuff
the habit is still prevalent in some sections snuffboxes for
retaining small quantities of the powder about the person are
of great vari ety of shape and material when snufftaking
was one of the habits of society these boxes were
often of much value and beauty of work manship gold
silver and precious ston were employed in their manufacture and

are made for the market hard soap and soft soap
in the former type soda is used as the combining

in economic use for the manufacture of soap may be
divided for discussion into live groups or alliances 1 coconut
oil and palmkemel mi 2 olive oil olive oi foods
cottonseed oil peanut oil sunflower seed oil and com oil
3 tallow greases and pni oil 4 castor oti and
lin seed oil 5 red oil and resin the oils
in the first group saponify very quickly at ordinary temperatures
upon the addition of cold con centrated caustic soda during
the action great heat is evolved a larger yield of
firm soap is obtained from these oils than from any
others they are however rarely used alone but are added
to tauow and cottonseed oil and this combination results in
a superior grade of soap better than can be made
from either of the in gredients alone their glycerine content
is higher than in any other group amounting lo 12
per cent the second group is composed chiefly of glycerides
of oleic acid they yield a thin soap very soluble
in water and make good toilet and textile soaps the
wellknown green castile soap when pure is made from olive
oil their glycerine content is about 10 per ceitl the
third group are glycerides of principally stearin and palmitin and
yield a firm soap of good body dissolving slowly in
water much improved by the addition of oils from die
first and second groups the oils of the fourth group
saponify readily yielding highly soluble soaps of a pale brownish
color useful in mak ing transparent sijaps the adds of
the fifth group combine directlv with caustic soda they are
used only in combination with other groups in the last
few years the process known as hydroenation has made oils
which had been unavailable for soaps a very important factor
in the raw materials market whidi had been seri ously
narrowed by the demand for all edible oils by the
manufacturers of oleomargarine and nut butter by this process oleic
acid is con verted into stearic acid t passing a
current of hydrogen gas through it in the presence of
re duced nickel while at the temperature of about 550
f this process is applied chiefly to cheap fish oils
which lose their objectionable odor during the treatment huuifactnre soap
is made generally by one of three processes i that
in which the glycerine of the fats is set free
and separated out 2 that in which the glycerine is
set free but not separated 3 that in which there
is di rect saponification and no glycerine is produced more
than 90 per cent of the soap produced is made
by the first plan the byproduct glycerine being very valuable
the oils and fats in pre determined proportions are measured
into the kettle a large cylindrical tank which may be
as much as 25 feet in diameter and 30 feltt
deep this kettle has an open steam coil in the
bottom to supply the heat part way uii the side
is an outlet pipe with a valve throu which the
crude soap is drawn into the crutcher after the saponification
is complete at the bottom of the kettle is another
outlet through which is drawn the watery residue after the
soap has been separated out following he charging of the
kettle with fats a measured por tion of a dilute
lye made with caustic soda is run in and the
steam turned on and the con tents of the kettle
vigorously boiled as the soda unites with the tat more
lye is added at intervals care being taken thai at

upper oac being of the searaled soap and the lower
one i mixture of brine glycerine and excess lye this
step in the process is called graining because oi the
granular appearance of the soap the amount of salt necessary
de pends upon the kind of oil and fat used
as the raw material some fats requiring much more than
others the salt is added in small instal ments until
the separation is complete after standing several hours the lye
is drawn off from the bottom of the kettle and
clear water turned in if the soap is to have
an admixture of resin it is added at this stage
a propor tion of caustic soda is added to remove
im purities and the boilinc is renewed and the soap
iin becomes a dear mass it is salted out a
second time and the process reated if i tr seems
desirable with the addition of lye only i the next
step in the process is fitting water is added by
degrees and boiling contmucd until the soap gains the proper
appearance readily i recognized by the experienced soap boiler it
is then allowed to settle which if the batch is
large may take four or five days more or less

re cently come into use whereby the cooling proc ess
has been reduced from several da in the ordinary frames
to two hous or even less the device consists in
forcing the liquid soap into metal casinss the sides of
which are con tinually cooled by the passage of currents
of cold water by the turning of a screw the
casings are released and the blocks of soap readily removed
when hard enough the blocks i the mass they are
then cut again lengthwise and crosswise into cakes wmich are
placed on racks to dry when diey have dried out
to the proper hardness they go to the presses where
each cake receives defitiite form and the imprint of the
mer thence they go to the machine whidi wraps them
preparatory to boxing for the tnarket toilet soaps are usually
milled the process beginning with shaving or chipping of the
blocks of soap as they come from the frames these
chips are allowed to dry hard perfume and coionng matter
are added and they are then run several times through
a mill of rollers which transforms them into thin flakes
while flakes are entirely homogeneous they go machine called the
plodder a cylindrical or conical casing in which revolves a
longitudinal screw the screw forces the soap forward under great
pressure and it is finally exuded through a form plate
in a continuous bar hav ing the outline of the
cake in which it is eventu ally sold the bar
is cut into sections of the proper size and these
receive their final shape the second process of soapmaking in
which the glycerine is set free but not separated is
used in the manufacture of soft soaps lar luantitics of
soft soap are used in the textile industry they are
made chiefly of unseed oil corn oil whale and fish
oils and in the finer grades of olive oil specif
white soaps are made with cocoanut oil and some tallow
as previously noted the lye used in making soft soap
is made from caustic potash the lye is added by
degrees as in making hard soap and the boiling is
done with a closed instead of open steam cou the
color of the finished soap depends largely upon the kind
of oil used but to a considerable extent upon the
care taken in the making good soft soap contains about
43 per cent of tatty acids 10 per cent of
alkali and 47 per cent of water in some grades
a per centage of saponified resin is added but this
is highly objectionable in certain textile soaps and the practice
is therefor limited the third process that in which the
glycer ine is not formed is known also as the
cold process the soap is not boiled the oils and
alkali being carefully proportioned to form complete neutralization while this
process was formerly restricted to cocoanut oil it has proved
workable with other oils and fats when the lye is
made strong it is required how ever that the fats
be adsolutely clean as all of the ingredients remain in
the soap the caus tic also must be of the
highest grade of purity the fats and oils are warmed
to the melting point and a little beyond and placed
in a crutcher the lye heated to 80 f being
run in gradually with constant stirring replacing a part of
the soda lye with potash up to 20 per cent
improves the soap when the appearance of the soap indicates
tnat saponification is well established the soap is run into
the frames and left to stand for a week being
covered to pre vent it from cooling too rapidly this
method is very ijopular with makers of toilet soaps as
it is available for small batches and docs not require

made of cocoanut ail as a base with some stearic
acid to give hardness both soda and potash lyes are
used and gum added to prevent its drying quickly glycerine
is a common ingredient and often a little sugar castile
soap when pure is made of olive oil and a
soda lye it soon becomes very hard however and to
remedy this cocoanut oil or linseed oil is used in
the mixture the cheaper google 150 so grades of castile
soap are made from cotton light or floatant soap is
produced by agitat ing a solution of soap to whidi
a fifth or sixth ert of water has been added
untii the lather s risen to a considerable height and
then transferring it to a mold where it remains until
the quality of transparency is fixed transparent soap is prepared
by drying ordinary soap dissolving it in alcohol allowing the
solution to remain at rest so long as any impurities
are precipitated decantinr off the alcoholic liquid and evaporating it
until it is of such a consistency as to solidify
when cooled in metallic molds many kinds of transparent soaps
are made by the cold process the trans parency being
accomplished by the addition of sugar glycerine is often incorporated
with transparent soaps for emollient effects while for disinfecting purposes
carbolic acid coal tar eucalyptus oil and other substances are
added mottled soaps are produced by mixinf min eral coloringmatter

the addition of arsenic a large mdustry has developed in
this country in scour ingsoaps which are produced by the
addition of fine sand or pumiccslone to the ordinary soap
when in its plastic slate soap powders are made by
mixing dry sal soda and borax with hot liquid soap
with the addition of a definite proportion of hot water
sufficient to provide the necessary water of crystallization to the
soda in its subsequent cmnge the mixture is stirred constantly

trays where the soda completes its crystallization it is then
milled to powder form hibtory the use of soap is
ol great an tiquih a wellequipped soap factory was found
by the excavators of pompeii histori cal records of italy
and spain show that soap was in use in those
countries in the 8th century it was known in france
in the 12th century and in england in the late
14th or early 15th century in 1622 james i granted
a monopoly to a soapmaker under which he was allowed
to make 3000 ions a year and paid 100000 a
year for the privilege in 1711 a tax of one
penny per pound was laid upon the soap pro duced
by english soapmakers and in 1816 this tax was increased
to three pence per pound in 1833 it was reduced
to one and onehalf pence and this tax when abolished
in 1853 was bringing annually into the british treasury a
revenue ot more than 5000000 soapmakiiig in america in the
amer ican colonies soapmaking was at first largely a household
art the housewife utilizing the fats saved from the drippingpan
to make soft soap for her own use and also
even a sort of hard soap of a quality however
that would not suit the housekeeper of today as early
as 1608 on the second ship from england to the
jamestown colony came a num ber of germans and poles
skilled craftsmen among whom were several proficient in handling fat
and soapashes in 1621 soapashes for export to england were
worth from six to eirht shillings per hundredweight and 50
years later the settlements now included in maine and new
hampshire derived their chief wealth from soapashes and fat while
there were small soapboiling establishments in nearly all the large
towns by 1795 their aggregate product probably did not exceed
300000 in value the discovery by nicolas leblanc qv about
1791 of a process for manufacturing soda on a large
scale was utilized some 30 years later when chemical manufacturers
and soapmakers began to avail themselves extensively of the supply
of soda thus cheaply afforded among the early establishments of
the soap trade one of the laiest was that of
william colgate of new york founded in 1806 fancy soaps
were at this time unknown and the mak ers of
the american product contented them selves with a very common
grade of soap but so rapid was the advance that
by 1835 they were supplying nearly all the home demands
and were also heavy exporters principally to england about 1850
american manufacturers were employing substantially the same methods and processes
that were used in england new england was then the
principal centre of the manufacture for the united states although
new york and philadelphia were gaining prom inence at that
time filling materials were practically unknown and settled soaps were
merely run into the wooden frames and crutched for hours
until rendered thick from cooling or were finished by boiling
down the matenal was ladled by hand from the kettles
into the frames or put into buckets or tubs and
carried and emptied into the frames tlie kettles themselves nad
castiron bottoms to which a wooden curb was fastened by
means of cement the composition of this cement which was
used to prevent leakage was re garded at that time
as a great trade secret especially when the cement was
capable of pre venting the leakage for some length of
time the waste lye was run off throng a pipe
reaching through the wooden curb to a point near the
bottom of the kettle the kettles were healed by open
fire and the contents were kept from burning by stirring
them with a long iron rod flattenedat the enot the
lye was made by leaching woodashes since the use of
caustic soda had made very slow advances while processes and
methods were thus comparatively speaking at a standstill during the
first four decades of the 19th century the soap industry
nevertheless steadily advanced in importance and prepared itself for the
wonder ful development that immediately followed the discoveries of chevreul

seen that american life presents a multitude of social citres
for the greatest variety of social activities religious sects fraternities
clubs and associations of all kinds both the activities and
the meeting places are roullitudinous the variety of such is
one of the most diiracteristic features of american life but
they tend to disintegrate the neighborhood and the com munity
rather than to draw it together and only to further
enhance the already overde veloped individualism which lies at the
base of so many of our problems of social and
civic life this general condition is of course the result
of the eclectic composition of our people gath ered from

as ins much that is best american county or neighborhood
is embodied in be school and educational policy there are
difficulties indeed in the way of making the school into
the social centre but it has always been and is
even day much more serving as a social centre the
tradition of its wider use is strong for in the
early days in the new com munities it served as
church meetinghouse pollingbooth as well as school and many other
social purposes for which with the time special buildings have
come into existence nor is the church without its claims
to be considered as a social centre in a way
not unlike the school there are some 15000 ro man
catholic churches and nearly 175000 protestant churches and meetinghouses like
the school the church is universal its tradi tion as
a social centre is longer historically and it has advantages
over the former of being an adult association and centre
and in appealing to wider range ot lifeinterest the development
of the sunday school and of weekday meet ings has
also greatly extended its capacity and social significance ln the
last generation much earlier than in the school the churches
saw their social duty and the opportunity for social service
in a society like ours the mstiltttionai church was in
existence long before any wider tuf of the school plant
was conceived as a result the church adapted its architecture
and arrangements sooner and developed power as a social centre
the greater use of the church plant was also more
apparent than even in the case of the school it
is fast becoming a very convenient social centre building for
the catho lic church has developed its separate parish houses
for the like purpose the modern in stitutional church thus
serves the need for an auttoriiun as well as for
the miscellaneous recreative and convivial activities of the com munity
and not only the physical arrange ments but also the
current spirit of religiuiis work increasingly tends toward the ideal
of social service it too has conceived the pur pose
of becoming a neighborhood or even com munity centre for
social service denomina tional divergence is its chief limitation in
ihi relation but the large unchurched masses of our populations
alike in city village and open country give large scope
to such purposes the specific communily church ot definitely social
service methods is becoming increasingly common church federation in various
forms and interdenominational action for many pur poses are fast
rendering the accomplishment of the churchs purpose to become a
social centre more and more feasible more receutty the great
fraternal orders are making their claim to serve as a
social centre the lodges are broadening their membership in various
ways to include women and the more recently organized oies
are showing a strong tendency to be more broadly social
in method rather than strictly secret or narrowly fraternal often
too their halls are in wide and frequent use as
the most available place for miscellaneous social gatherings our communities
have it is true not yet developed the townhall or
civie centre as of the european type the townhalls of
new england and of the north centra states where its
institutional influence has extended in a minor way often serve
this purpose but for the country in general there is
as yet no sign of such a development the civic
centre is probably a long way off in our insttutional
development although it may some day crown our efforts toward
social centies thousands of halls espeoially in the north and
east states approach somewhat to the char acter ot social
centres so the social settlements which have been established in
various parts of the great cities with the object of
furnishing neighborhood centres have in a sense pioneered the move
ment in urban populations city churches and school administrations have
been foremost in the same direction also a favoring condition
in the creation of urban social centres is the formation
of neigh borhoods neighborhood business centres have long been in

the 10000 villages al ready existing are now fully realizing
their function as social centres for their farmdis tricts moreover
the new means of communi cation and transportation have brought
the fanner closer to his neighborhood centre the significance of
the development of the village in our rural districts cannot
be overestimated for although in the case of manj of
the re cently developed special community centres they have been
located in the open country there seems little doubt that
the social as well as the business ceneics of such
districts will naturally appear in the villages this is in
creasingly true of the consolidated schools and of the new
rural churches more and more the village serves as a
locus for the social centres of the rural community such
then are the more normal widespread and underlying tendencies making
for the de velopment of social centres in american cotn
muniiies and neighborhoods much more spectacular and noteworthy but really
much less significant are the many special and local centres
that hae been established special local or personal conditions have

centre in the city of rochester may be regarded as
the leading pioneer the krider use of the school plant
has become a commonplace among educators in all parts of
the country it has taken many forms but all in
the direction of making the school a ii not the
social centre more particularly it has involved use of the
building for educational purposes in other than sehoolhouses evenings and
weekends holidays and vacations in fact during fully onehalf of
the total available time the schoolbouse has become useful as
a social centre this has all come about in a
few dec ades the conception too of the educational function
of the school has broadened it is now used for
play as well as study for work as well as
for learning it now gives opportunity to those whose school
education has been interrupted and even for parents to gather
that they may keep in touch with the schools work
for their children this expansion of use and function began

new duties and opportunities for the sduols as social centres
are thus being yearly con to the smallest towns and
villages the leaders of the country church in all the
denominations have furthered the movement in this sphere notable and
successful examples of community rural churches have been created by
individual personalities especially have the presbyterian and methodist eihscopal churches
been active in furthering the social service ideal the most
notable ones have been in the open country under especially
favoring local conditions village churches have frequently seen their future
in serving in broader ways the social needs of their
community and thrir rural districts the redirection of church policy
has been not less noteworthy than that of cdu in
a few conununities strictly jono ctntres separate from any partictilar
existing institu tion or establishment have been created but these
are rare and are rather a foretaste of the future
of the movement than an ideal eo be held out
for practically immediate realization american local life is ready for
social centres but not yet for a social centre unless
under very special circumstances those who have the movement at
heart must rather seek to facilitate widespread and normal tendencies
making for the realization of their purpose rather than to
artificially create a premature institution the movement for the development
of social centres is thus widespread arising from the need
of all classes of our population and in all types
of community it has affected every type of existing social
institution and almost transformed hr material equipment their spirit and
method of work it is the ex pression of and

the con stitution and ordering of states in 1743 rousseau
had gone to venice as secretary to m montagu and
had acquired some slight practical experience of diplomacy and state
craft some time after he conceived a vague noiect of
composing a treatise along these lines and about a decade
later after tne suc cess of his first discourse seems
to have set himself to work in earnest on an
ambitious dy google social dehbcracy soctal tnurahtiti volume political institutions
which remained in his mind for years but which was
never finished the work was probably distasteful to lis eloquent
and imaginative author because of its abstract and theoretical character
and was therefore laid aside as an afterthought he later
revised rthought 1 of ms tially a fragment and in
his own mind and that of his contemporaries was set
on a lower plane than his novel ltla nouvelle heloise
or emile his treatise on education it is in this
light that it should be regarded today in writing it
rousseau intended it as ap plicable onw to an ideal
communal state of about 20000 inhabitants whose interests and character
were homogeneous he himself warns against attempts to apply it
outside this sphere his theory involves an orgaiiic con ception
of the slate in which sovereignty is represented as the
will of the organism more or less closely attached to
this conception are several important assumptions government according lo rousseau
exists by virtue of a tacit agreement with each individual
governed by virtue of this contract every individual agrees to
abide by the general will the individual citizen thus stipulates
that on all questions and at all times it is
his will that his state shall he governed by the
general will therefore even in cases where the particular individual
is overruled bj the contraryminded majority he has the satisfaction
of knowing that his fundamental principle of government is being
maintained the greatest danger of rousseaus system lay in the
fact that on this basis he developed a mystical notion
that the general wiu which in practice is only the
will of the greater number cannot err he failed therefore
to put any check on the tyranny of majorities much
of the radical democratic theorizii of our time like that
of the recall and referendum find their beginning in the
sodal contract intended as we have seen in the iirst
instance to provide an ideal basis for a small city
state in spite of many interest ing suggestions as a

term which originated within the last dec ade in germany
socialversicherung and france assurance ioeial to cover that field of
social or labor legislation known heretofore as workingmens insuranceabor insurance
or even industrial insurance the broadening of the term indicates
not only the tendency to extend the methods of worungmens
insurance over other groups and social classes such as the
agri cultural cls or lower middle class but also the
desire lo draw a clearer line of demarcation be tween
this form of insurance and other branches of insurance conducted
as a private business though an enormous literature concerning social
insurance has grown up in america as well as in
europe no generally accepted defini tion exists and the new
term s somewhat more difficult to definje than the older
term work ingmens insurance in an official report pub lished
by the united states government it is de fined as
the method of organiied relief by which wage earners or
persons similarly situ ated and their dependents and survivors be

occurrence of certain emergen cies dr fr l hottman defines
it to com prehendall efforts methods and means to pro
vide in conformity to insurance principles a sufficient pecuniary method
of wage workers and others in moderate circumstances as against
the economic consequences of industrial acci dents disease incapacity for
work and finally dependence in old age resulting from sickness
infirmity or even imprudence or personal neg lect the absence
of a generally accepted dec of view is gradually gaining
ground however that the term cannot be described simply on
the basis of the groups to be insured or the
dangers against which insurance is provided but largely on the
basis of the methods and the attitude of organized society
ie the slate and its govern ment thus there exists
private insurance operated for profit and mutual insurance as a
form of mutual protection but in absence of a definite
governmental policy mutual insurance is not necessarily social insurance which
latter comes into existence through legislative action historically it holds
true uiat social insurance is still largely workmens insurance that
is ex plained by the fact that modem industrial so
ciety is based upon a system of wage labor that
wageworkers exist by sale of their labor and therefore depend
entirely upon the preser vation of their working capacity on
the other hand they are more exposed to all possible
hazards because of the nature of their work and therefore
are more in need of insurance protection finally the workingmcn
themselves have laid the foundation to social insurance through the
development of mutual benefit so cieties through several centuries divisions
of social idsurance the fol lowing divisions or branches of
social insurance are at present recognized and exist in some
countries 1 industrial accident insurance or work ingtnens compensation 2
occupational dis eases insurance or compensation 3 insurance ainst nonindustrial
accidents 4 general sickness or health insurance s maternity in
surance 6 invalidity insurance 7 old age insurance 8 funeral
benefits insurance 9 widows and orphans pensions or insurance 10
unemployment insurance this classification is based upon the forms of
insurance in actual existence many efforts of a systematic classification
have been tnade usually on the basis of the economic
or physical hazards involved barring vice and crime or feneral
economic inefficiency and low wages actors of a genera character
with which ihe social insurance method does not concern itself
directly ihe three conditions which threaten the workingmens family are
1 absence of any d 6 google 1 social insurancb
wabeeamer itirough premature death which may be due to sickness
or industrial or non industrial accident 2 the physical incapacity
of the wage earner lo earn which may be lem
krary or permanent partial or total and may due to
old age sickness or accident and 3 the inahility of
the ablebodied wageearner to find a sale for his labor
power by some of the 10 forms of social insurance
above mentioned each one of these three causes of destitution
can be met and destitution pre vented by the insurance
method of spreading the loss over a larger group in
fact over the entire community concerned the admitted social insurance
methods may be classified into four groups or graduations i
the establishment of state insurance funds or institutions through which
insurance to the workinen is made cheaper and more attrac
tive 2 substantial subsidy of the working mens insurance by
the state offering to pay a part of the premium
in further effort to attract the wageworkers 3 the method
of compul sion under which certain groups or classes are
required to become insured by virtue of legis lative enactment
4 the method of enforced contributions from employers or industry
for the benefit of the insured wageworkers in some social
insurance systems all of these four methods may be combined
while in others only one of the four may be
utilized modem students however seldom feel justified in ap plying
the term social insurance unless at least one of these
four methods is used while in popular use the term
is beitig somewhat im properly restricted to the compulsory methods
considerable difference of opinion exists whether straight governmental pensions paid
out of public funds may be included under the definition
of social insurance since they op erate without any consideration
of insurance principles or methods this holds true of old
age or invalidity pensions in some european countries and british
colonies and widows and orphans pensions in many states in
america nevertheless textbooks of social insurance usually include these pension
systems nolwith standinf their deviation from insurance prin ciples social
insurance is not governed b the strict requirement of private
insurance science it emphasizes the assurance rather than the mathematical
accuracy of rates it merges into what is known in
france as prevoyance so ciale in germany as soziale ftirsorge
and may be translated as social care of needy individuals
history the origin of social insurance at least in its
modern phase is usually credited to bismarck and to the
acts of 1883 and 1884 by whid the german sickness
and accident insur ance sgtstem5 were established but as a
matter of fact the elements of mutual insurance em ployers
contributions state subsidy and even compulsion were well known in
germany and partly in other countries before the acts of
1883 and 1884 were important however as germany the social
compulsory ment extended to other germanic and gradually to all
other european until perhaps turkey remained the only country without
any social insurance legislation the extent however to which this
branch of social legislation expanded in each country differs considerably
see workmens comfensatioh health insurance old ace insurance and pensions
the compulsory principle met with consider able opposition outside of
germany and austria hungary for perhaps a quarter of a
century in opposition to it the latin countries italy france
spain and belgium experimented with the method of subsidized liberty
liberty as sistfe ie by granting more or less substantial
subsidies to stimulate voluntary insurance the scandinavian countries showed a
tendency to follow the latin principle great britain re mained
indifferent leaving the problem to the gontaneous efforts of mutual
insurance and e slavic worid neglected this as well as
other branches of labor and social legislation within the last
8 or 10 years there has taken place a very
marked development in the attitude of all europe to this
question of compulsion in social insurance so many compulsory insur
ance systems ainst sickness old age employ ment etc were
passed between 1909 and 1914 when the european war put
a temporary halt to all constructive social legislation that it
is highly inaccurate to describe the compulsory method as a
germanic method compulsory compensation for industrial accidents is fairty universal
in europe compulsory health insur ance is found in 10
countries while voluntary subsidized insurance exists in four france and
sweden have followed gcrmans example in establishing compulsory old age
insurance great britain marked a very important step in 1911
by establishing at once systems of com pulsory insurance against
sickness invalidity and unemployment in many countries without a general
compulsory system partial systems for certain industries exist and in
several others many steps have been taken for an estab
lishment of compulsory systems and these were only postponed through
the action of the war social insurance legislation was perhaps
tihe most important topic of legislation in europe during the
last decade the entire modem social insurance movement proceeds from
the theory that not only is the individual wage worker
unable to meet the hazards that face him or the
cost of insurance against them but that also holds true
of the wageworkers as a group financial assistance is therefore
a very essential principle of social insurance in regard to
industrial accidents the principle is fairly generally recognized that they
consti tute a proper charge upon industry and with a
few minor exceptions industry through the em ployer is made
lo bear the entire cost thai is also true of
occupational diseases wherever they are specifically provided for health or
sickness insurance has developed upon a basis of joint contribution
of employers and em ployees in proportions varymg in different
countries itle more recent enactment added hovever the principle of
slate subsidies so thai in ihe acts of norway great
britain and some others the cost is divided between em
ployer and employee and the state in invalid ity and
old age insurance this method of con tributions from three
sources has been recog nized in the benning and gradually
the ad vantage of distributing the cost between em ployer
employee and the state or in some google social insurancb
168 cases the local geographic and administrative unit are gaining
the position of a general social insurance standard in favor
of such a method the advantages of a wider distribution
of the cost are empha sized it is argued by
some students that the same advantages can be achieved in
a very much nmpler way by putting the total cost
at once upon the state this has expressed itself in
the old age pension systems of great britain eeiimark france
and some australian coun tries in a few maternity pension
acts and some 20 mothers pension acts in the united
slates further extension of this method of gratuitous pensions at
least in some branches does not appear impossible development in
united states interest in social insurance problems in the united
states is very recent and scarcely extends over nx or
seven years though of mutual etforts toward insurance of worlonen
there have been many trade unions fralemal societies large employing
corporations railroads municipalities and some other political entities have tried
to build up some systems of insurance protection of wageworkers
in a leslative way the prob lem began to attract
attention only toward the close of the first decade of
the 20th century when the movement of compensation legislation spread
throughout the country though the early acts were declared unconstitutional
in 1911 and 1916 32 states passed accident com pensation
acts and compensation is almost uni versal outside of the
black belt almost simul taneously with that from 1913 a
very active agi tation for mothers pensions developed which proved
successful in more than 20 states old age insurance and
pensions have been discussed for some years and were made
the subject of several state investigations with occasional en dorsements
of the underlying principles but as yet without any specific
recommendation for immediate action the unemployment situation of the years
1913 and 1914 especially coming after the establishment of the
compulsory un employment insurance system of great britain has stimulated
interest in this most difficult branch of social insurance but
the strongest recent development has been in the direction of
sodal health insurance in 1915 an investigat ing social insurance
commission was provided for in california and in 1916 in
massachusetts both spedatizing in the problem of health in surance
the american association for labor legislation has a standing committee
on social insurance since 1912 devoting most of its work
to health insurance the first national con ferences on social
insurance were held in chi cago in june 1913 and
the second one under the auspices of the united states
government ill december i9i6 the california commission in its report
recommended health insurance legislation as the most practical solution of
pressing social problems after workmens com pensation it advised the
adoption of the com pulsory system because of the probability
of a law of this kind being declared unconstitu tional
by the state courts a constitutional amendment was submitted to
the voters in 1918 and meeting with violent opposition from
the christian scientists and from the commercial insurance companies was
rejected up to the beginning of 1919 massachusetts was the
only state which provided vocational training for industrial cripples as
part of its compensation scheme eight state legislative commissions were
investigating the subject of health insur ance in the winter
of 191819 organiied labof was pressing more insistently for the
enactment of compulsory health legislation the new york state federation
of labor placed health a tive candidates in 191amp despite
this a aiy legislature in the 1919 session defeated all
efforts to enact health insurance legislation in new york members
of the medical profession were opposed to such legislation the
massa chusetts commission reported in favor of sickness prevention in
1918 but made no veiy definite recommendations as tomcthods among
the states which have appointed commissions to investigate social insurance
problems are con necticut illinois ohio new hampshire penn sylvania
and wisconsin compensation and in surance for soldiers and sailors
and allowances for their dependents were provided by federal enactment
in 1917 at the close of hostihties in november the
government reported that nearly 37000000000 had been taken out in
life insurance by our over 4000000 men of the army
and navy this was the greatest ii for such it
is that the world has wiu hitherto since the total
amount of life ance carried by commercial and other companies
is estimated to be 3000000000 less than this amount it
is generally admitted that health insurance of a compulsory character
will be the local development from compensation les the effect
of social insurance upon the well being of the working
masses is recognized by students of economic conditions with hardly
any exceptions there are probably some 60000000 in europe who
with their depend ents enjoy some one or more forms
of social in surance protection the financial operations of the
social insurance systems annually measure many hundreds of millions of
dollars which go to relieve destitution and suffering among wage
workers either in form of pecuniary benefits or medical or
similar curative care a substan tial proportion probably more than
onehalf of that amount is contributed by the employers and
the state in virtue of the law but it is
frequently pointed out that of more importance than the mere
relief of existing distress is the preventive effect accident compensation
proved to be an important factor in accident prevention health
and invalidity insurance though a better form of organization of
medical surgical and hospital aid is recognized as a powerful
factor for general conservation of life and health maternity insurance
is advocated because of its effect upon the health of
mothers and also as an additional force in the struggle
against ex cessive infant mortauty unemployment insur ance to exercise
a salutary effect in prevention of excessive depressions because it
preserves to some extent the purchasing powers of the unemployed
wageworkers as against these advantageous effects social insurance is being
frequently charged with pro viding a stimulus to malingering that
a cer tain amount of such malingering develops un der
social insurance as well as under any other fonn of
insurance is usually admitted but it is claimed that this
evil tendency may be kept in check by appropriate administrative
care and google 164 social legislation social psychology diat it
is more than counterbalanced by the salutary results upon the
health and happiness of the working class it is admitted
that in no country has social insurance as yet entirely
abolished pauperism and destitution because in no country has this
method been developed to its highest capacity and also because
there exists certain factors of destitution not amen able to
the social insurance method but the rapid extension of this
method from one coun try to another is pointed to
as a sufhcient argu ment in favor of the advantages

psychology social psy chology is that branch of psychology which
deals with the mind as it is affected by and
manifested in relations with other minds it deals with the
behavior of human beings and animals in groups and the
emotions and thoughts which group behavior involves there is a
tendency on the part of certain writers to regard it
as the psjchology of the group mind or of group
behavior while others would em phasize rather the individual in
the group and consider it as dealing with the behavior
and experience of individuals when they form part of groups
the former hold that the mind of a group of
individuals is a real beingj something more than the aggregate
of the individual minds which compose it in this article
we shall take the position of the latter that all
psycholon deals with individuals and that social psychol ogy deals
with them in their relations to one another social behavior
is manifested throughout the animal kingdom i in the form
of special re sponses to living that is moving stimuli
2 in that of special responses to individuals be longing
to the same species in the tendency to form collections
of individuals to respond wkh aid to sounds of alarm
to imitate the sounds and movements of other animals and
even in the case of ants and bees to assume
certain special functions in the service of the social group
certain individual bees for instance take upon themselves the work
of ventiladne the hive by placing themselves near its moutfi
and rapidly moving their wings social be havior is manifested
also 3 in the sex reac tions of animals both
those connected with mating itself and those concerned in guiding
the sexes to each other through the senses of smell
hearing and sight it is manifested 4 in parental behavior
where the movements of the parents are adapted to secure
the welfare of offspring from our animal ancestors we in
herit ail these forms of social behavior as in nate
tendencies or instincts excellent discus sions of social instincts may
be found in mc dougalls social psychology and shands the
foundations of character the social instincts of man however differ
from those of the lower animals in being acgt companied
by imaginative sympathy the so cial behavior of animals shows
features which that i of the mental state of others
stance an adult wasp engaged in feeding the young lacking
other food to present to a larva bit on a
piece of the larva itself and offered it as food
to the larvas mouth the social be havior of animals
is determined wholly by ex ternal stimuli and by the
animals physiolocal slate that of human beings is determined largely
b these but also by the imaginative in terpretation of
other persons minds thus ani mals imitate merely the movements
of other ani mals htunan beings imitate the mental states
of derived from such animal instincts as the gregarious instinct
the imitative instinct the fighting instinct the self exhibiting instinct
the sex and parental instincts we have the social emotions
anger jealously sex and rental love and the sentiments such
as admiration con tempt agreement vanity and so on it
is pos sible also to trace the moral sentiments and
the religious sentiments to innate roots which are denved from
the lower animals thus sodal psychology furnishes the scientific basis
of ethics the instinct of imitation has been given es
pecial prominence ty socialpsychologists the french sociologist gabriel tarde in
his works les lois de 1 imitation tmd ltla logique
so dale regarded imitation as the most funda mental phenomenon
in sociology he defined a society as a group of
persons who imitate each other and pointed out that like
undulation in the physical world and heredity in the world
of life imitative currents in society spread in geometrical proportion
arc modified by the medium throu which they pass and
interfere with each other out of the interferences of imitative
currents inventions arise e a ross social psychology is based
largely on tardes teachings recently the tendency has been to
lay less emphasis upon imitation but it seems dear that
only through imitating other person are we enabled to understand
their mental states and that an innate tendency to imitate
ts the toot of that imaginative sympathy which accompanies social
behavior in man another instinct which is of especial import
ance to the social psychologist is obviously the gregarious instinct
the different types of so cial groups formed by human
beings are espe cially interesting to those who regard the
mmd of a group as an independent entity we may
distinguish groups linked by the sex and pa rental instincts
ie families groups linked by necessity by a common aim
such as social psychology lee phiianihropy or relion by likeness
of external drcumscances or situation and so on each of
group has its peculiar features and the mind of an
individual differs according to which type of group he is
related to at a given time it is interesting also
to study the mental differences between groups such as the
races and the sexes separated by congenital unlike an innate
tendency of the first significance to social psychology is suggestibility
it is really the tendency which we all have to
carry out ideas into action but the term usually indi
cates this tendency in the case where the ideas are
recognized aj coming from some other mind the strongest influence
which opposes suggesti bility is the fighting instinct inherited from
the lower animals individuals vary greatly in the deeree of
their suggestibility some persons bauc at every suesuon coming from
others even though it be in the line of their
own de sires while others are at the mercy of
the last person who advises them measurement of the suggestibility
of a given individual is a task of much practical
value in diagnosis it has been attempted by the method
of showing pictures and then questioning the individual about what
he has seen a certain number of the questions relate
to details which were not really present in the picture
and the number of such sugges tions that the person
accepts is regarded as indi cating the degree of his
suggestibility binet in his la suggestibility developed a number of
other simple methods of testing suggestibil ity especially in children
every normal pfer son tends to resist suggestions to a
certain de gree thus sidis in his psychology of sug
gestion states as the law of normal suggesti bility that
it varies inversely with the directness of the siiggesdon direct
suggestions tend to ex cite the fipiting instinct in certain
cases how ever even a normal person will accept direct
suggestions the most important conditions of such acceptance are the
prestige of the sug gestor and repetition of the suggestion
indirect suggestions are suggestions given in such a way that
ihry do not obviously come from another mind they seem
to proceed from the individ uals own thoughts or from
the surroundings the whole problem of securing the acceptance of
suggestions is probably the most practically important part of social
psychology it con fronts the advertiser the salesman the educa
tor the rehgious and the political leader the psychology of
advertising for instance is now 3 distinct branch of research
to which the busi ness world is lending strong financial
support and from which it is getting valuable returns under
certain contutions suggestibility be when the field of rowed so
that the criticism which a suestion ordinarily encounters in the
mind of the per son to whom it is made
is lacking the sug gested idea takes entire possession of
the at tention and no reasons for opposing it are
con sidered such a narrowing of the field of con
sciousness called dissociation occurs in hysteri cal states in strong
emotions and in the hypnotic trance persons thus abnormally suwestible
may be dangerous to the community the ex istence of
abnormal suggestibility thus is a fact of which the criminal
law must take cognizance it is probable however that no
person other wise dioroughly normal can be hypnotized into the
performance of an act of crime abnor mally suggestible persons
are likely to be men tally defective although breuer claims
that the hysterical temperament is found in persons of the
highest intellect and character goddard in the criminal imbecile records
a case of murder apparently due to the abnormal sugges
tibility of a feebleminded person in the hands of another
individual abnormal suggestibility is interestingly manifested even by normal persons
in a psy chological crowd a mere aggregate of inu
viduafs however closely crowded physically does not constitute a psychological
crowd the individuals must have their attention fixed on a
common object as soon as a number of per sons
concentrate their attention in the same di rection thty lend
to become abnormally siie gestible this is due largely to
the loss of the normal sense of the criticism of
others a con siderable portion of the criticism with which
a person in the normal slate opposes a suggestion is
derived from his thought of what persons other than the
suggestor may think of his con duct the feeling that
others are with us as in a psychological crowd obliterates
this criti cism thus persons in a crowd do what
they would never do as isolated individuals since the emotions
are the experiences which all man kind has in common
while ideas vary greatly from one person to another an
aggregate of persons becomes unified into a psychological crowd more
quickly under the influence of emo tions than under that
of ideas the crowd has the characteristics common to all
humanity and often displays instincts which are in the normal
individual suppressed it is incapable of real thought since most
persons enjoy emotions and dislike to think most persons enjoy
enter ing into psychological crowds lebons the crowd is the
classic discussion of the phe nomena of crowd psychology the
phenomena of the religious life offer a fruitful field for
the social psychologist reli gion itself in so far as
it concerns the relation of man to a higher personality
is a product of the social instincts the desire for
companion ship and protection and is closely related to the
gregarious parental and sex instincts in the striking phenomena of
sudden conversions we have an mteresting illustration of the ultimate
effect of suggestions which have been resisted their effect has
nevertheless been registered in the subconscious or unconscious regions of
the nervous system and the sudden transforma tion of the
individuals life and ideals is due in all probability to
their having accumulated suf ficient force to break down the
resistance of fered to them by processes in the conscious
lev els of the nervous system persons of a hys
terical temperament who are subject to disso ciadon or splittii
of consciousness are more likely to experience sudden changes of
heart and ideals closely related to social psychology and in
deed forming an essential supplement to it b folk psychology
this is the study of the ori gins of social
phenomena such as sodal groups language relion and art these
origins must since they lie in a past long preceding
the dawn of history be studied chiefly through the in
vestigation of the phenomena of savagie ifamp d google social
reform programs and movements it is difficult 10 say how
far these really repre sent primitive levels of culture in
the case of religion the remarkable longevity of relious rites
enables us to trace certain religious ideas back into prehistoric
times the facts point toward the existence as the earliest
known germ of religion of a prepersonal type of reli
gious attitude marked by rituals designed to use the supernatural
power or virtue the mana in various objects and animals
which aroused mans awe a stage of totemism which preceded
belief in gods in the case of art a study
of savage customs strongly suggests that one group of arts
is derived from the danc which with its power of
forming psychological crowds is a great factor in the life
of primitive peoples music poetry and the drama are all
protbly in debted to the dance for their origia the
deco rative arts can be studied almost from their bennings
through the preservation of buried objects and of drawings on
the walls ofcaves it is more difficult to trace the
earlj history of language than that of either religion or
art owing to the rapid and complicated processes of change
which it undergoes and to the fact that when in
a primitive state it is not written the reader will
find interesting material on folk psychology in thomas source book
of social origins and in wundts folk psychology translated by
schaub margaret floy washburn department of fsychology vassar college social
reform programs and movements their hutodcal develop ment i introduction
the programs and movements for social reform date back in
their origins almost to the dawn of written history oppression
of certain classes existed in the first historic societies and
it is not surprising that some of the earliest literature
reflects the growth of discontent among the subject groups as
professor selig man has pointed out the desire to improve
the social environment has ever been the dynamic impulse back
of the evolution of economic doc trines though it is
quite true that theories which have once been the harbingers
of prog ress may later be utilized as a bulwark
of the existing order while proposals for the better ment
of social conditions have appeared in all ages they have
been most numerous after great social and economic revolutions which
have al tered the status of existing classes and have
brought an abnormal amount of misery to those whose condition
was most seriously affected by the transition the development of
athens into a commercial empire the growth of the plutocracy
in the roman republic the disinte gration of roman society
in the 4th and 5lh cen turies ad the breakdown
of feudalism and the origin of the national states the
rise of the bourgeoisie following the commercial revolu tion that
greatest of all social and economic revolutions the industrial revolution
of the late isth and 19th centuries and the growth
of modern imperialism with the expansion of european civiliiation throuout
the world are wellknown examples of social and economic transformations
which have produced their ac comikinying programs of social reform
thouf it mit be interesting to deal in some detail
with the early social reform movements preced ing the industrial
revolution the far greater significance of those which nave followed

of this brief survey to a sketch of the more
significant social reform move ments and programs which have developed
since the opening of the 19th century il social reform
movements betobe thx couuercial revolirnon though it was not the
first social reform program the earliest scheme for social recon
struction which has remained a classic through the ages was
the republic of plato here was proposed a society resting
fundamentally upon a social division of labor being physically perfected
by an elaborate plan of eugenics and governed by the
wisest members of the com munity but even plato recognized
the futility of hoping for the adoption of so rational
a social system and it was marred by another serious
defect beyond its utopian flavor on ac count of the
fact that it was designed to appl only to the
upper classes the others would it was hoped be reduced
to a still more severe and permanent state of subjection
the gracchi brothers made an attempt to check the growing
power of the roman plutocracy but die vested interests proved
too strong for their efforts the apostolic christians living in
the hope of an imminent return of christ developed com
munistic tendencies and doctrines but the spe cial circumstances under
which they were con ceived prevented them from having any
con siderable significance for the history of social reform programs
white the eschatological conception had been somewhat weakened by the
time of the later patristic period it was still powerful
enou to paralyze any social initia tive the faithful were
warned against undue concern over earthly conditions lest thej thereby
forfeit entry into the kingdom of heaven the poor were
regarded as a part of the divine order who existed
for the spiritual edification of the rich almsgivers the patris

system which developed as the social basis of feudalism and
the general backward ness of mediaval civilization made the mid
dle ages a period designed to discourage any radical movements
in social reform it should not be forgotten nevertheless that
the more radical relious movements of the mediaeval seriod associated
with the waldenses the ai igenses the franciscans and the
lollards car ried with them a varying degree of revolt
against the social and economic conditions as well as the
religious institutions and practice of the time it is probable
that of all the mediaeval programs of social reform the
most interesting and progressive was that set forth by pierre
dubois at the opetiing of the 14th century in his
de recuperatione terre sancle with which mr powicke has familiarized
eng lish and american readers finally the discus sions of
the conciliar movement bear perhaps some vague relation to the
problem of social reform in so far as that is
related to the de velopment of representative government iii the
commercial revolimon and thk resulting soaal refobm movements while as
professor shepherd has insisted there is need of a greater
preciaeness ot d google social reform programs and hovembnts 167
definition in dealink with die commercial revo lution as a
phase in modern history it will suffice for the purposes
of this survey to regard it in the conventional manner
as the period of uscoveries and colonization which befn in
the iaie islh century and lasted for about three centuries
in its first phase with it should be associated its
epochmaking reactions upon european civilization in nearly every field this
great transformation brought with it the decline of the feudal
order the rise o the mer chant dass in the
political as well as the eco nomic field and the
gradual development of the modem national state at first purely
dynastic but later becoming more and more a represen tative
if not a democratic institution at first the new merchant
class or bourgeoisie sup ported the kings in their attack
upon the feudal nobihty but once the feudal lords had
been coerced the middleclass arose against the mon archs and
brout them within the restraints of constitutional limitations upon the
royal pre rogative the social and economic effects were not
less distinctive the manorial system was undermined or completely shattered
the gild kstem was weakened or wholly supplanted by e
domestic system and the above changes profoundly affected all social
classes working its severest effects upon those whose status was
reduced by the transformation in the intel lectual realm the
curiosity stimulated by the discoveries led to those great scientific
advances in nearly every field for which the 17th century
is conspicuous the social philosophy which was produced by the
commercial revolution bore a close re lation to the politicai
social economic and in tellectual setting which was created by
it in the field of political theorizing the rogtal abso
lutism was accompanied by the divine right doctrine associated with
the names of filmer and others while the rise of
the bourgeoisie against despotism produced as a philosophy of justification
the social contract school with their apolces for revolution in
the writings of dney locke rousseau and their followers nie
social and economic changes with their accompanying misery to the
lower classes gave rise to the various utopias which attempted
theoretically to construct ideal societies which would embrace none of
the evils of existing conditions this class of writings was
best illustrated from widely differing pomts of view by sir
thomas uores utopia francis bacons new atlantis tommaso campa nellas
city of the suivgt james harringtons oceana and francois fenelons
tlmaque the growth of rationalism was especially sig nificant for
the development of social reform programs while the relational is
ts were rarely violent political or social revolutionists never theless
as professor robinson has made clear their very scepticism concerning
current views on the nature and significance of natural and
social phenomena inevitably led to a critical attitude toward social
institutions and the grad ual development of a spirit of
reform par ticularly important in this respect were the doc
trines of the english deists and their followers among the
french phiiosophes taking their premises from the laws of mechanics
governing e natural universe which had been discovered 4y newton
and his predecessors the deists in slstell that dlere was
a natural order a roeimc of natural laws which governed
the social system as well as the natural universe and
to which social institutions should conform tliey held further in
radical contrast to the depress ing theological views of auguslire
and calvin that man is inherently decent and worthy of
study in the effort to improve his earthly en vironment
this doctrine did more than any thing else to remove
the obstacles to social self improvement which were embodied in
augus tinian eschalology and the predestinarian an thropology of calvin
and was very effective in producing the growth of a
humanitarian spinl strangely enough however a part of their cosmic
and social philosophy became it self a great barrier to
social reform when their notion of the natural order was
adopted by the adherents of economic liberalism to form the
metaphysical basis of their defense of laissesfatre finally it should
be remembered that in spite of the fact that it
was designed wholly in the interests of the ujgtper classes
the extensive legislation involved in mercantilistlc commercial regulations furnished a
precedent for widespread state activity which might one day be
exerted in the behalf of the proletariat the french revolution
has long been re garded as a unique and heroic
event in human history but recent analysis has proved it
to be but a final phase of the reactions of
the com mercial revolution upon france henry iv richelieu and
mazarin with the aid of the new middleclass had destroyed
the political power of feudalism but had succes fully stifled
the growth of representative or democratic institu tions in france
the french revolution marked that stage of development in which
the bourgeoisie ended even the economic and social vestiges of
feudalism and terminated irrespon sible royal despotism the social revolution
achieved by the french between 1789 and 179s consisted mainly
in the despoiling of the feudal landlords and the elevation
of the middle or business class the latter not only
attained unto political power but also secured legisla tion giving
far greater freedom to business en terprise no other class
profited materially from the revolution while the nobility and th
clergy were greatly reduced in wealth power and prestige the
programs of social reform put forth during this movement varied
all the way from the advocacy of limited constitutional monarchy
by lafayette and sieyes to the fan tastic radicalism of
the mountain and the openly avowed socialistic proposals of francois
but in spite of some radical programs of s reform
and some mobviolence by the prole tariat the tower classes
both agrarian and in dustrial failed to profit to any
marked degree through the french revolution which was above all
a bourgeois movement for the ele vation of the proletariat
in france three subse uent revolutions and the growth of
modern industrialism were required one of the most important and
farreaching effects of the commercial revolution upon so cial history
was its preparation of europe for the more sweeping transformation
in the indus trial revolution by breaking up the feudal
system and agrarian isolation by stimulating commerce and thp growth
of capitali by inviting colonial enterprise aftd the dcvolopment of
for google 160 social rbporh programs and hovbhbnts agn trade
aid by developing constitutional gov ernment to give business liberty
and security the commercial revolution paved the way for the
coming of the industrial revolution that the latter came first
in england is to be ex plained by the fact
that england had partici pated most extensively in the commercial
rev olution that her industries and natural resources were best
adapted to the adoption of a mechani cal system of
manufacturing and that she had developed to the greatest degree
of any countiy in europe thai constitutional and legal protec
tion to industrial and conunercial enterprise which was indispensable to
any extensive expan sion of business iv the industbial revolution
and the so aal phobleus it created it will be
quite impossible in the space available to describe the mechanical
inventions which constituted the material basis of the industrial revolution
or even to enumerate all of its diverse results for
this the reader must be referred to the preceding article
in this encyclopedia by prof e l bogart on the
industiuai revolution it will suthce at this place to describe
it as that great economic trans formation which introduced the
mechanical era of manufacturing and the improved motive kgtwer for
transportation and the communica tion of intelligence together with the
great social political and intellectual changes which accompanied the economic
transition the effects of the industrial revolution amount in their
totality to modem civilization but only a few of uie
more generally recognized re sults can be mentionea here throu
the in troduction of machinery the minute divi sion of
labor and the special xation of indus trial processes there
resulted a vast increase in the volume of commodities produced
for sale and a eat consequent expansion of com merce
leading to that search for new markets which constitutes the
connecting link between the industrial revolution and the development of
modem national imperialism the factory system necessitated the congregation of
work men into the new industrial dties which now sprang
up for the first time and supplanted the agrarian age
the bourgeoisie were greatly increased in numbers and wealth and
evolved into a distinct capitalistic class a sharp distinc tion
now arose between capitalist and laborer and social and economic
relationships passed as professor burgess has pointed out from a
personal to an impersonal basis the laborer became progressively more
and more dependent upon the capitalist and the problem of
unem plcmnent became much more serious women and children were
introduced as laborers in the new factories to their moral
degradation and shysical deterioration the division of in uslrial processes
into minute stages made it impossible for the workman to
complete the manufacture of any ccwnmodity and thereby lessened his
interest in its production and created a psychological burden which
had hith erto been foreign to industrial processes the machine
technology as professor veblen has explained brought a psychic and
cultural standardiiadon correlated with the mechanical e recesses of the
new order in the large owever the industrial revolution meant
at professor shotwell has insisted a transition from an agrarian
civilization based on isolation repetition and stability to the modern
order founded upon a dynamic industrialism and the development of
worldwide relationships it has constituted far the greatest transformation in
he historj of humanity and has produced at least a
materia progress more notable than the race had yet achieved
from its beginnings down to the close of the 18th
century it was inevitable that so fundamental and sweeping a
transformation as this should bring great hardship upon those who
suffered most from the transition mad the proletariat been able
to support itself by handicraft trades and by petty agricultural
operations their lot would not have been so hard but
at the very time when the mechanical inventions were making
handicraft competition impossible an agrarian revolution was taking place in
england which ousted the peasantry from their agrarian hold ings
the new merchant princes desirous of attaining the social prestige
of the ancient landed nobility and encouraged by the new
agricultural methods which had been intro duced by tull townshend
and bakewell pro ceeded in the period from 1760 to
1840 to buy up most of me land of england
for great estates the peasantry were bought out or evicted
and were compelled to take refuge in the new industrial
cities where they became the helpless victims of the avarice
and greed of the parvenu capitalist manufacturer those who remained
in die country and tried to com pete with mechanical
industry or largescale agriculture met a fate not less severe
than that of those who migrated to the cities in
the cities the great surplus of laborers made wages low
and unemployment frequent the possibility of utilizing the labor of
women and children reduced the wages paid to adult tnales
or led to their discharge all men women and children
worked at monotonous labor during excessively long days for starvation
wages in dangerous and unsanitary shops amid moral conditions even
more deplorable at night they were herded into cheaply built
tene ments even less healthy than the shops as one
writer has expressed it they hved the life of a
madiine while working and at other times that of a
beast the chimneys of factories and dwellings were swept by
very small children under conditions which meant the permanent ustortion
and dwarfing of their bodies and serious diseases of the
respiratory tract if they were not fortunate enough to meet
an early death in the mines conditions were if anything
worse than in the factories women and small children as
well as men worked in damp and dark underground pas
sages amid vermin and filth for long hours at a
stretch at the most severe type of physical labor for
a jritlance whatever one may think of their remedies there
is no doubt that the socialistic analysts of these conditions
such as marx and engels have drawn an accurate pic
ture of the horrors of the social conditions during the
first stages of the industrial revolu tion it would scarcely
be possible to exag gerate them one must not however
foiget to give due recofpition to these early citalists for
their part in building up the industrial dviliiation of the
modem e probably tlw google social reform programs and movements
greatest achievement of human genius even though it threatens at
times to develop into a frankenstein further it is nol
necessary to assume that all of these early capitalists were
fiends to allow such conditions to exist among the working
classes they were usually in little personal contact with conditions
and the old business ethics that had governed the gild
and domestic systems were wholly inadequate for the new circumstances
while no new sys tem of industrial morality had yet
evolved nevertheless it must be remembered that the conditions in
the business establishments in the early staees of modem industrialism
re sembled what hobbes imagined the life of man in
the state of nature to be and it is there
fore not surprising that these evils produced a literature of
protest and reform which was un precedented in volume and
variety the proletariat found it impossible to help themselves out
of the serious oppression to which they had succumbed in
no important country in europe did they exercise the right
of suffrage permanently before 1848 and th played an insignificant
part in politics until the last quarter of the 19th
century labor organizations were forbidden entirely or penalized by unfavorable
legislation violent opposition to the existing order was made well
nigh impossible by the savage criminal codes of the time
which reached their worst form in england where nearly 300
capital crimes were enumerated any farsighted program of self improvement
by the laboring classes through education and enlightenment was impossible
of realization for no comprehen sive system of free public
education existed in europe except in prussia which was not
vitally affected by he industrial revolution until the decade following
1870 v ikueiiiate keuedies psofosed bv conteh pokabies to solve
the social pbobleus ckeated by the insustkial revolution 1 economic
liberalism the first great type of reform proposed to meet
the new conditions was that which has be designated liberalism
but which is more generally known as the economic doctrine
of laissesfaire or the political theory of individualism this body
of doctrine cannot be properly appraised un less the historical
circumstances surrounding its origin and diffusion are taken into con
sideration it began before the industrial revolution as an attack
upon the archaic legis lative restrictions which had grown up
as a part of the mercantilistic commercial and colonial doctrine
and in so far as it helped to clear away
diese obstructions it contrib uted to the coming of modern
industrial so ciety after the industrial reolution had come however
its later adherents utilized the lauttefaire concepts to defend the
new capi talistic order and to prevent as far as
possible the solution of the grave evils it created throuf
remedial legislation the founders of economic liberalism were the group
of french writers in the middle of the i8th century
known as the physiocrau from the work of one of
their adherents pierre samuel dupont de nemours entitled physi ocracy
or the natural constitution of that form of government most
advantageous to the human race 1767 they took their basic
doctrine from the english deists and the french philosophes to
the effect that the realm of social political and economic
phenomena was governed by the same natural laws that newton
and his associates had siiowfi to rul the physical universe
they believed that the perfection of all human social institutions
could best be realized by making them conform to this
natural order a condition which would most certainly be produced
by a regime of unlimited competition accordiny they vigorously advocated
the immediate and totu abolition of all restrictive legislation and
the introduction of an era of laissesfmre indi vidualism the
chief functions of the state and the promotion of education
so that i might grasp more sureiy the principles of
natural law extensive legislation was re garded as dangerous for
it would probably impede the operation of those benelicent natural
principles upon which they placed their chief reliance the physiocrats
contributed views of less significance in their interpretation of social
progress in terms of the net product of agriculture and
their scheme of a reform in public finance which centered
about the notion of a single tax on land the
moving genius among the physiocrats was francois quesnay 16941774 who
was ably seconded by goumay mirabeau duponl de nemours mercier
de la riviere badeau and la troine the general notions
of the physiocrats con cerning individualism and state inactivity ex
cept in the field of abolishing restrictive legis lation received
the support of the distinguished french economist and statesman anner
robert jacques turgot l72 and of the rst great systematic
writer on political econonw the scotchman adam smith 1723 90
the chief significance of adam smith for the history of
social reform is that he embodied the iausesfaire thesis in
a notable work ltan inquiry into the nature and causes
of the wealth of nations 1776 which re ceived so
wide a circulation and attracted so extensive a following tor
smiths doctrines that the historian buckle nearly a centurjf later
regarded this book as the most influential and beneficial one
ever written aside from his acceptance of the general physiocratic
position on the proper functions of the state smith abandoned
to a considerable degree the ex cessive physiocratic laudation of
agriculture and emphasized the value of commerce and manufacturing industry
especially did he re vive the platonic doctrine of the
importance of the division of labor in increasing and im
proving productivity and his emphasis upon the part played by
labor in production paved the way for the later views
of ricardo and the socialists respecting tfae labor theory of
smith however died before the industrial revolution had fully developed
even in eng land and there is good evidence for
holding that he did not even foresee the course of
this transformation much less stand out as an apologist of
the new capitalist clas but his dgt google 170 social
kbporh programs and uovehbht8 doctrines were of a sort which
fitted in ad mirably with the policy of noninterference which
the capitalist manufacturers desired to have prevail in order that
they if not their employees might enjoy the blessings of
ihe perfect freedom of contract therefore his notions were expanded
and utilized by the middle alass and sympathetic economists to
furnish an authoritative theoretical opposition to social legislation designed to
advance the interests of the industrial proletarial the most extensive
development of his con cepts naturally took place in england
where he had written and where that mdustrialism which was
most congenial to his views was the furthest advanced tut
he was honored by reverent disciples in every important european
state and in the united states his most dis tinguished
english disciples were thomas robert malthus 17661834 david ricardo 1771823
james mil 17731836 john ramsay mcculloch 17891864 and william nassau
senior 17901864j the one thing which in particular distinguished the
doc trines of smith from those of his disciples was
his greater optimism a difference which may be explained by
the great change in the economic environment in the interval
which had elapsed while the central importance of tiiese writers
was their elaboration of the in dividualistic hypothesis each contributed
some special interpretation of more or less origi nality aiul
significance malthus held that s also useless as far as
any hope of proving the poorer classes was concerned he
maintained that even though distribution were equalized no permanent good
could result be cause population tends to increase more rapidly
than the means of subsistence and this dis parity between
population and available means of support would ultimately be restored
and with it would come a return of poverty and
misery through an excessive birthrate the proletariat created its own
misery and the only hope of permanent relief lay in
the artiamp cial contra and restriction of the birthrate through
the postponement of marriage ricardo paid particular attention to the
subject of dis tribution from the physiocratic notion that the
wages of agricultural laborers tend toward the minimum of subsistence
and malthus doe trine of population he derived his famous
sub sistence theory of wages according to this theory wages
tend to that level which allows the laboring class to
ejdst and perpetuate itself without either increase or decrease hence
the folly of legislation designed to enlarge the in come
of the proletariat for the resulting in crease of population
would prevent any diminu tion of poverty and misery further
ricardo attacked the landlords by maintaining that rent tended to
absorb an ever greater share of the social income and
that their interests were op posed to those of all
other economic classes finally he laid the basis for the
marxian theorj of value by holding that within certain definite
limitations value is deteonined by the amount of labor involved
in production jamea mill brought into economic liberalism the utilitarian
philosoahy of bentham regarding the diaxiintim good for the laiest
number which mill and his associates confidently believed to be
attainable through the operation of the sirinciples of economic liberalism
mccul och was chiefly a systematizer of the principles of
his school and was the most sympathetic member of the
group toward the laboring classes being a supporter of place
and hume in the attempt to legalize tradeunionism senior represented
the final and most extreme stage of economic liberalism through
his attempt to perfect economics as a purely abstract and
ob jective science and by his ardent apposition to even
the mildest form of legislation beneficia to the laboring classes
while most of these writers took little active part in
politics their ideal of perfect competition for the em ployers
and subjection for the workers was eagerly adopted by cobden
brisht and other members of the manchester school and the
liberal parly in their effort to reduce the power and
privileges of the landed aristocracy and to enforce and perpetuate
the servile and helpless status of the laborers further their
notions were widely popularized and their gen eral views were
as much the order of polite conversation in british parlors
as the rous seau ean notions of the state of
nature had been in the french salons of a half
century in france the doctrines of the later version of
economic hberahsm were espoused by a number of economists the
most notable of whom were jean baptiste say 17671832 and
frederic bastiat 180150 says position was very similar to that
of senior he maintained that political economy was purely a
descriptive science and not in any way a practical art
the economist should simply study and for mulate economic laws
and should never usurp the functions of the statesman reversing
the position of the phvsiocrats he laid greatest stress upon
the poouctivity of manufacturing and he was the most enthusiastic
of all the eulogists of the new era of mechanical
in dustry he was the french bourgeois economist of the
period as guizot was the statesman of this group bastiat
revived the optimism of adam smith and as an ardent
aiimirer of cobden devoted his attention chiefly to an advocacy
of free tradamp the func tion of the state he
held was solely to main tain order security and justice
so obsessed were say and bastiat over the importance of
the manufacturing and commercial classes that many of their less
scientific followers came to deny that poverty or misery existed
in germany economic liberalism was de fended by johann hdnrich
von thiincn 1783 1850 and karl heinrich rau 17921870 while
in america henry c carey 17931879 first introduced the classical
political economy though he differed from smiths later support ers
by reviving the optimism of smith and at tacking the
pessimism of malthus moreover he advocated national proiectionism in contrast
to the free trade doctrines of the others of the
though it will be evident that economic liberalism was as
distinctly a capitalistic move ment as socialism has been a
proletarian agita tionthat as cliffe lesue expressed it they created
a science for wealth rather than a science of weajthtteverfheless
it cannot be d google social kbforh pkooram8 and hovemsnt3
denied that their efforts accomplished much that was good before
rational stateactivity to solve the problems created by the industrial
revolution could begin in an effective manner it was necessary
that the antique rubbish of mercantilism should be cleared away
and this was the great contribution of the economic liberals
and their political adherents even though they offset much of
the value of their destructive efforts by obstruction of subse
quent progressive legislation it should also be fointea out in
passing that the economic berals were aided by the contcmimrary
losophy of romatiticism with its denial of the possibility of
artificially accelerating the rate of political progress and by the
political individualism which had been set forth by wil helm
von humboldt and was later taken by john stuart idill
in his earlier days and by herbert spencer in england
the more notable practical effects of economic liberalism were the
growth of free trade associated with the work of huskisson
cobden bright peel and gladstone the abolition of such archaic
politi cal restrictions as the test and corporation acts the
increase of the political powers of the middle class in
the central and local gov ernment by the refonn bills
of 1832 and 1amp35 die abolition of slavery in the
colonies throng the efforts of wilberforce and buxton the re
peal of the savage criminal code as a result of
the work of romilly mackintosh buxton and peel the development
of a policy of pre ventive treatment in the handling
of the prob lem of poor relief which was evident
in the nouble poor law of 1834 and the first
antic ipation of a more liberal policy of imperial government
through the leadership of lord durham and others in france
serfdom and the gild monopolies were abolished before the close
of the 18th century guizot directed the orleanist regime solely
in the interests of the capitalists and bastiats doctrines were
able to win napoleon iii for free trade in prussia
stein and hardenburg were able to secure legislation looking toward
the complete aboli tion of serfdom and gild monopolies and
the development of municipal self government following 1819 a more
liberal economic and commercial policy was embodied in the famous
zollvereitt the work of maasscn billow eich hom and von
motz most of the other ger man states followed prussia
in this liberalizing policy and some like baden quite outdistanced
her in this respect it will be apparent how ever
that none of this legislation materially benefited the proletariat indeed
some of the legislation of this period was specifically de
signed to paralyze ail efforts of the laborers at selfimprovement
and the agitators for the abolition of negro slavery in
the colonies passed by unnoticed a far worse type of
slavery which existed at home among their own countrymen such
a body of doctrine could not endure long unchallenged in
the face of the growth of modem industrialism and the
increasing misery of the proletariat 2 english philosophical radicalism and
utilitarianism utilitarianism a term used by jeremy bentham and pven
currency by john stuart mill is the designation usually applied
to the school of writers headed by bentham ltampi8s2 and
including among otbers james mill george grote john austin alexander
bain and john stuart mill they represented primarily the spirit
and tenets of economic liberalism in the field of political
theory and their work constituted the only signincant contribution of
england to this field between the time of burke and
that of spencer essentially they were a further development of
that philosophical radicalism in england which grew out of english
sympathy with the french revolution and was represented by william
godwin thomas paine william cobhcrt francis place anl that group
of literary men such as shelly byron and words worth
with whose works and ideas mr brails ford has recently
made english readers famil iar this roup stood in direct
opposition to the satisfaction which blacks tone and burke expressed
over the alleged perfection of british institutions and maintained the
necessity of radical changes in the direction of eliminat ing
archaic laws institutions and practices in his earlier years bentham
might have been logically classed with this group for his
first notable work a frjjnent on government 176 was a
violent attack upon the com placency of blackstone but he
gradually de veloped a general philosophy of reform and thus
remolded radicalism into utilitarianism his doctrines were based upon the
hedonistic psychology which had been anticipated by machiavelli hobbes and
helvetius and upon the ethical slogan of the greatest happiness
for the greatest number a principle earlier enunciated but not
greatly developed by hutcheson beccarla and priestley institutions were to
be judged according to their contribu tions to the attainments
of this greatest happi ness his practical program of reform
however indicated that like the economic liberals he re garded
unrestricted competition and enlightened selfinterest as the chief avenues through
which his utilitarian program could be reahzed his chief concern
was vrith the abolition of restric tive legislation but he
did urge some positive reforms such as education of the
masses the extension of savings institutions public health legislation and
prison reform further though bentham and his immediate followers might
seem to have regarded the greatest good to the greatest
number as best attainable through conferring the greatest amount of
goods upon the business classes his terminology was one which
if honestly interpreted was excellently adapted to serving as a
basis for urging a large amount of positive remedial legislation
in the behalf of the proletariat in this way the
utilitarian premises later became an important force supporting constructive social
legislation in fact this evolution of utilitarianism is evi dent
even within the circle of its own ad herents for
john stuart mill eventually evolved from an exponent of marked
individualism into a vigorous exponent of social legislation in the
interest of the laboring classes and a not unappreciative student
of distinctly socialistic proposals probably the only im portant achievement
of this group in the way of aiding the lower
classes was the work of francis place and joseph hume
in securing the temporary legalization of tradeunionism but they made
important contributions to ecimng that abolition of olulructiv legisla d
google social reform prograhs and hovehbnts tion which was described
above in connection with he practical results of economic uberalism
3 the rise of distinct forma of oppo sition to
the individualism of economic liberalism a the criticism of economists
there were a number of theoretical difficuhies ir economic liberalism
which would naturally attract the opposition of political economists while
smith had actually assumed to be more concerned with the
wealth of a nation than of a class it is
nevertheless true that his fol lowers seemed to be chiefly
concerned with the wealth of the new business class rather
than with the problem of increasing the prosperity of the
entire nation this brought upon the school the criticism of
economists who presented a national or sodal theory of wealth
and main tained that the increase of the wealth of
in dividuals or classes was no safe criterion for judging
of the value of an economic social or political policy
to the state or society this was the point of
view especially of the english man lord lauderdale 175w839 and
the scotchcanadian john rae 17861873 the position of the economic
liberals generally and of senior and say in particular that
the economist must maintain his science as a purely abstract
and descriptive discipline and severely refrain from advocating any policy
of state manship or social reform was vigorously at tacked
by jean charles leonard de sismondi 17731842 an itinerant swiss
scholar he was the most distinguished and effective ex ponent
in his age of the notion that economics has a
distinct function in promoting general prosperity and social leform a
point of view since urged with vigor by economists like
schmouer gide webb hobson fisher fetter and seager he saw
clearly that economics should be intimately concerned with the prob
lems of practical statesmanship and applied sociology and more than
any other writer of his time he foreshadowed modern social
eco nomics moreover his practical program of reform embraced most
of what is now mcluded in tradeunionism factory legistadon and
social insurance he was a sohtary figure in his age
but his doctrines were later accorded respect as economics swung
back more and more to the sodal point of view
again the economic liberals were internationalists and exponents of free
trade this attitude was attacked by the early nationalistic economists
adam hen rich miiller 17791829 frederick list 1789 1846 and
henry c carey 17931879 they defended the poucy of a
national protective tariff to give national selfsufficiency and pros perity
the nation rather than individuals classes or human sodety as
a whole received their spedal solicitude they were not how
ever inflexibly dogmatic in this position and list in particular
held that after the indus trial revolution had become thoroughly
estab lished in a country free trade might be bene
ficial but to protect infant industries in the first stages
of industrial development a pro tective tariff was indispensable finally
the economic liberals erred in the direction of too great
an abstracdon and absolutism in economic doctrines they generalised too
much from contemporary conditions and were confident in the universal
and eternal applicaulity of their r laws and theories this
defect was corrected by the early representatives of the historical
school of ecunomics chiefly richard jones 17901855 bruno hildebrand 1812
78 wilhelm rosdier 181794 and kari knies 182198 the predominance
of the germans in this group has ted to the
practical identification of me historical school with ger man economists
these writers ridiculed the element of absolutism in the clascal
economic doctrines and maintained that any set of eco nomic
theory could be true only for the society from which
the facts or premises were drawn therefore economic theories must
change with historical alterations in the economic consti tution of
sodeties and there can be no in variable economic laws
nor any valid economic theory which ignores the dynamic elenfent
of economic progress b political opposition and humanilarianism it has
been shown that economic hberalisra was primarily an economic philosophy
and a political program designed in the interest of the
capitalists who in politics adhered to the whig or liberal
party it was but natural tlierefore that it would be
assailed by the party whose economic and political interests were
diametrically opposed to the business element namely the landed proprietors
who made up the biilk of the tory or conservative
party the tories had a number of leasons for dis
liking the capitalists in the first place there was the
social aversion of the aristocrat for what he regarded as
the parvenu eager to break into his ranks then they
felt that the new industrialism had destroyed forever the merrie
england in which the landlords were supreme again they entertained
a jealousy of the grow ing political power of the
middle class espe cially after the latter had forced through
the reform bill of 1832 finally the economic iiueresls of
the two classes were fundamentally opposed the tories desired a
continuation of the corn laws to keep the price of
grain higi while the business class desired their abolition to
secure cheap wheat and therefore accord ing to the current
economic reasoning cheap labor the tories were extremely fortunate in
finding a point of attack upon the capitalists which enabled
them to cloak their political and economic aims under the
mantle of humani tarian sentiments and to entertain some hope
of increasing their political following among the proletanat this avenue
of assault de cided upon by the tories was factory
legisla tion which would reduce the prosperity of the manufacturers
by compelling them to gram higher wages or shorter hours
and introduce better physical conditions and appliances in their factories
probably too much has been made of this point by
recent writers who have followed arnold toynbee in emphasiiing the
political and economic selfishness that motivated the landlord factorv reformers
doubtless many of the leaders in tnis movement were governed
by real humanitarian impulses but it can at least be
said that they were especially favored in finding a line
of social reform which harmon ised particularly well with thdr
economic and political interests the leaders in the earlier sts
of this tory social reform were an thony ashley cooper
seventh earl of shaftes bury 180185 michael thomamps sadler 101835
richard oasller 17891861 and dy google social reform programs and
movements its john fidden 17841849 they secured the appointment of
the investigating commissions that have furnished the preseni generation with
most of their sources of information concern ing the contutions
amone the laboring classes in england during the first half
of the 19th century and obtained much remedial legislation designed
to alleviate or eliminate these con ditions it is impossible
in the space available to describe in detail the contents
of this legis lation but its general character can be
indi cated the factory acts of 1802 1819 1831 1833
1844 1847 1850 and several minor laws of the sixties
secured for the laboring classes in practically all factories the
10hour day proper factory inspection safety appliances better sanitary conditions
and a general dis couragement of child labor wornen and
chiu dren were excluded from mines and better hours and
safely devices provided for in acts of 1842 18ss and
1872 the distressing evils iu the employment of juvenile chimneysweeps
were eliminated by laws of 1834 and 1840 particularly the
work of ashley was the im portant factory act of
1833 and the famous tenhour bill of 1847 thus political
jealousy and economic rivalry between the upper and middle classes
were able to achieve for the bet terment of the
proletariat much more than the latter and iheir sympathizers were
able to ob tain for themselves while shaftesbury ma have
been motivated by some genuine humani tarian impulses in his
campaign for social re form it is doubtful if the
same can be said for the continuator of his policy
benjamin disraeli 180481 probably the most un scrapulous and selfcentred
politician in ene lish history that he thoroughly understood the
oppression of the peasantry and the industrial eroletariat no reader
of his sybil can doubt ut little evidence exists that
he was touched by any real personal sympathy for the
op pressed atid much leads one to the conclusion that
his advances to the lower classes were founded upon purely
partisan and persona motives and ambitions in part he continued
shaftesburys social legislation but his appeal for the support of
the proletariat was primarily political by the reform act of
1867 he ex tended the suffrase to the greater part
of the urban laboring class this type of social re
form again appeared in england during the conservativeunionist rigime when
it was par ticularly associated with the name of joseph
chamberlain this benevolent paternalism born of political rivalry was confined
in its earlier stages chiefly to england for there alone
had the new business class attained to sufficient proportions to
attract the organized opposition of the landed interests it appeared
at a later time in other european stales most notably
in the case of the bismarctdan social insurance legislation c
early ckristiansocuiium thenewcapi lahsm and industrialism and its theoretical apolosts
among the economic liberals were nndemably associated with materialism and
rationalism and this inevitably led to opposi tion from the
churchmen and the faithful of all types while programs of
social reform hostile to economic liberalism were put forward by
catholics high churchmen broad church men and dissenters one unifying
purpose runs throuh all of their work namely the desire
to socialize christianity and thereby to capture social reform for
the church and to attract for religious institutions and practices
the in creasing gratitude and favor of the nimierous members
of the proletarian classes in the field of social catholicism
there were a number of interesting developments particu larly in
france under the bourbon restoration and the orleauist monarchy the
movement began as a revival of emotionalism obscuranti cism and
political reaction in the doctrines of francois rene dc lateaubiiand
17681848 louis gabriel ambroise de bonald 17541840 and joseph de
maistre 17sw821 but the growth of democracy affected church as
well as state in france and the exponents of the
religious revival clearly understood that if they were to make
any headway they would need to liberalize the catholic standpoint
this was partially achieved by antoine frederic ozanam 181353 who
founded the society of saint vincent de paul and linked
up neocatholicisin with practical philanthropy by alphonse de lamartine 17901869
who attempted to con nect the catholic movement with the
growth of republican sentiment in france by robert de lamennais
17821854 who tried ineffec tively to harmonite cathoucism and the
prin ciples of the french revolution and by phtl hppe
joseph buchei 17961865 who adopted the historical viewpoint of the
jerman school of economists tried to prove the spirit of
christianity to be revolutionary anticipated the gild socialism of bishop
von ketteler and franz hitze and advocated a scheme of
co operative production and distribution the protestant members of the
first im portant group of christian social reformers have usually
been those specifically designated as christian socialists but there seems
no doubt that this title could with equal accuracy be
extended to the catholic reformers the leaders in this movement
were chiefly anglican deicymen of the broad church party though
there was some support accorded by the uni tarians the
most prominent members of the christian socialist group in england
were john frederick denison maurice 180572 charles kingsley 181975 and
thomas hughes 1822 96 others of influence who adhered to
their general point of view were john m f ludlow
18211911 and johnlalor 181456 maurice conventionally regarded as the founder
of tlfc movement in england was especially interested in promoting
the cause of the education of the laboring class kingsley
analyzed the sodal problems of his day in powerful sermons
and telling books like alton locke yeast and waterbabies xjke
buchei he also urged the formation of worlringmens organizations and
the institution of cooperative associations probably the most enduring contribution
of english christian socialism to social reform was the impulse
which it gave to the organiza tion of cooperative and
profitsharing socie ties of which one the famous rochedale pioneers
has endured to the present day the cooperative movement spread
rapidly on the continent and has developed particularly in denmark
and belgium the other important effects of christian socialism in
this first sta was its aid to the cause of
the education o ig v google 174 social reform proqrahs
and m0vbhsnt8 the proletariat and the arousing of the interest
of the anglican church in social reform the impulse to
social refornl within the anglican church originated by he christian
socialists attracted even members of the high church partj and
the leaders of that obscurantie and emotional reaction the oxford
movement such as whately arnold froudc hurrell newman keble and
pusey lent their support to the development of tradeunionism and
the betterment of housing conditions among the poor finally even
the dissenting sects par ticularly the quakers and the newer
evangelical organizations as dr faulkner and miss simeral have shown
took a very significant part in agitating for remedial legislation
for the poorer classes d the jesthetic revolt against material
irm and misery while the industrial revolu tion has produced
nearly all the material com forts of modern life and
created many new forms of art and beauty as well
there can be no doubt that in its first stages
at least the new industriahsm with its dismal factories clouds
of smoke and filthy tenements was ex tremely ugly and
repulsive to the aesthetic tem perament and to humanitarian impulses
there fore the new order of things and its supporters
among the economic liberals received a vigorous attack from those
who were the representatives of the literary and artistic standards
of the ae this socalled aesthetic revolt against the origins
of the modem industrial order was of a rather varied
sort ranging all the way from the purely cultural protest
of men like matthew arnold to the conversion of leading
literary figures like george sand and william morris to open
socialistic programs while most of the lead ing figures in
art and literature during the second third of the 19th
century were repulsed by the new industrial developments a few
can be singled out as the leaders in the aesthetic
protest among these were robert south ey 17741843 thomas carlyle
17951881 samuel coleridge 17721834 charles dickens 181270 charles rcadc 181484
john rus kin 181919x matthew arnold 182288 william morris 183496
ralph waldo emer son 180382 george sand madame dude vant
180476 and leo tolstoy 18281910 of this group the most
important were carlyle rnsldn george sand and tolstoy carlyle is
significant chiefly as a critic of materialism and the economic
abstractions of the classical school he had no constructive program
of reform further than a willingness to wait for some
unique genius to appear with a ready made solution ruskin
was as bitter as carlyle in his criticism of the
new industrial society and its ideals but he offered some
solution of the problems through his advocacy of a restora
tion of the dignity of labor the institution of a
regime of industrial cooperation stateeduca tion government workshops and state
insurance for the working classes a part of his program
bordered on the gi idsocial ism of a slightly later
period but he set education above all other types of
relief for the situation jeorge sand of a slightly earlier
period imbibed freely the utopian and revolutionary socialism of the
forties in france and by her writ ings did much
to populariie these notions in particular the doctrines of pierre
lerouk tolstoys reform program was espe cially retrogressive and irrational
he advo cated a complete abandonment of the new in
dustrialism a return to an agrarian age and the organization
of the agrarian economy ac cording to the principles of
the russian mir with its communistic practices considerably ex panded
while one can appreciate the real and valid motives for
this revolt of the aesthetic against the repulsive features of
industrial society this group oflered little in the way of
workable constructive re forms few except those who went over
to socialism had any real reform program only an insane
person could accept the proposal of some of them that
society should revert to a e reindustrial revolution economy where
kings ved with less comforts than the average work iiigman
of today further even those who like ruskin had some
program to offer were scarcely in line with modern industrial
de mocracy but desired the establishment of some sort of
authoritative and benevolent paternalism in spite of all this the
esthetic protest was a real contribution to the reform cause
for it effectively insisted that an increase in material gain
was no complete justificatian of a new order of civilization
and maintained that modem industrialism must make a place for
the realm of the ideal and the aesthetic the more
recent circle of htcrary critics of the social order like
fimile zola analole france bernard shaw h g wells john
galsworthy maeterlinck and upton sinclair differ from most of their
predecessors in that instead of favoring a re turn to
a more primitive economy and social order they are among
the most ardent ex ponents of radical social reform only
a few enamored with the best of older civilizations and
seeing only the darkest phases of the pres ent order
have looked back with longing eyes to a bygone age
in this class may be put profs j p mahaffy
and warde fowler ralph adams cram and j a symonds
e utopian socialism and the reconslrueticn of the social and
economic environment it has already been shown that those extremely
radical schemes of social reform which are con ventionally known
as utopian appear in the greatest numbers after some great
transition which brings with it an abnormal degree of misery
the industrial revolution the great est of all such transitions
and probably the most productive of accompanying misery natu rally
brought forth an unprecedented number of utopian plans for the
solution of existing social problems but all of these programs
were more realistic and practical than the somewhat fanciful utopias
of the 17th century in the most fundamental sense utopian
socialism of the first half of the 19th century was
a revolt against the semifatalism of the premises of economic
liberalism which had represented so ciety as the product of
natural laws and forces had accused the proletariat of being
the authors of their own miiieries and sorrows and had
sharply denied the possibility of improving con ditions artificially through
constructive lepsla tion utopian socialism denied this premise of romanticism
individualism and economic hb erahsm and revived the notions of
the french revolution to the effect that human intelligence and
ingenuity were fully equal to the task of i a
v google social reform programs and movbmsnts 175 m temporary
i forging held that human i u of the i
ingly the solution of the was to be found in
the creation of a better set of social institutions and
practices they maintained that man can by rational thought determine
his own social system and social re lations and some
like foutier even claimed that man may by wellconceived legislation
an licipate the normal course of social evolution the initiator
of the utopian schemes of this period is conventionally assumed
to be count henri de saintsimon 1760182s though he can
be quite as much regarded as the formu btor of
the chief theses of comtian sociology and a forerunner of
christian socialism and though there is no doubt that the
other utopias would have appeared out of the surrounding conditions
had saint simon neer written probably saint simons most important
con tribution to social science and ultimately to sccial reform
was his contention that the social problems created by the
industrial revolution were of so serious a sort that a
distinct science of society or of social rcconstiuction must be
evolved to deal with them this goal was at last
realized with the foundation of scientific sociology in the works
of auguste comte her bert spencer and the early jrganicists
saint simon s practical program of reform rested upon the
reconstruction of society according to two somewhat divergent proposals namely
the restoration of the practices and principles of primitive christianity
and the handing over of society to the control of
a group of industrial experts who would reorganize things in
a rational and humanitarian manner his em phasis on the
abiuty of a purified christianity 10 solve current political questions
constituted an impulse to the later development of christian socialism
while his proposal for a scientific direction of modem industrial
society was elaborated by his disciple auguste comie in the
latters principles of a positive policy the disciples of saintsimon
developed his diverse notions enfantin and bazard em phasized the
communistic principles which were to be found in that primitive
christianity which saint simon had so much admired leroux defended
the notion of the sodal and moral equatip of men
and stressed the concept of the essential and desirable solidarity
of societyand of the interests of all social classes comte
attemjjted to systematize the new social science of which sainisimon
had seen the need the greatest of the french utopians
was francois marie charles fourier lt17721835 he was one of
the most thorough belieers in the possibility of reforming mankind
throupft the cieatioq of an ideal social environment this he
believed would be found in an apartment house utopia a
cooperative community or phalanstery of some 1800 individuals he hoped
ultimately to see human society reconstituted as a world federation
of phalansteries the capital of which was significantly to be
lo cated at constantinoile fourier wisely did not plan a
society which would wholly abolish all private property or attempt
to equalize all classes and individuals but worked out what
he believed to be a proper fractional distribu tion of
the sodal income between labor catntal and enterprise while he
did not profoundly affect france no other member of the
utopian group attracted so large and sympathetic a following in
america and many phalansteries were established in the united states
the most famous of which was brook farm founded and
conducted by some of the most noted members of the
brahman caste of new england literary lights the remaining french
utopian reformer was etienne cabet 17881856 whose follow ers established
an experimental community first in texas and later in nauvoo
111 the lead ing engli utopian was robert owen 1771
1858 who came info the field of utopian theorizing fresh
from a practical demonstration of the possibility of establishing an
ideal in dustrial community at the cotton mills in new
lanark he had ornized an advanced industrial community which at
the opening of the 19th century possessed most of the
features which characterize the more progressive indus trial ornizations of
the present day and which was unique at that time
while owen gave his support to almost every type of
constructive philanthropy which was current in his day hc is
knovn espedally for his agitation in the cause of factory
legislation and tradeunionism his vigorous advocacy of industrial coopera tion
and his concrete plan for ideal industrial communities the latter
did not differ markedly from that of fourier though each
group was to be slightly smaller though his plan was
adopted in several places in the united stales most notably
at new harmony ind it re sulted in little practical
success and the en during mark which owen left on
social reform consists chiefly in his support of every means
of aiding the solution of existing evils and his emphasis
upon the peculiar virtues in coop eration but significant as
were the premises and the achievements of utopian sodalism in
emphasizing the ability of sodety consciously and artifidally to solve
its own problems this type of sodalism could scarcely lead
directly into marxian sodalism it was too imprac tical and
from the standpoint of the marxian it was not suffidentiy
democratic the utopians did not set forth plans designed to
aia the proletariat alone but aimed at a reconstruction of
all of society in a very real sense they were
as much the forerunners of modem french solidarism as of
marxian socialism between utopian and marxian socialism there intervened the
stage of transitional socialism by which socialism was made a
revolutionary and a proletarian movement more recent echoes of the
utopian movement have been william mor ris news from nowhere
and edward bellamys looking backward f transitional or revolutionary socialism
the most important figures in oie socalled transitional sodalism were
the irishman wil liam thompson 17851833 the frenchmen louis blanc
181382 and pierre joseph proudhon 18095 and the germans wil
helm weitling 180870 and ferdinand la saile 182564 though proudhon
played a more prominent part in founding modem anarchy and
lasalle is equally distinguished as an advocate of stale sodaksm
as far as his practical reform prtram is concerned thompson
was a disciple of robert owen but his inquiry into
the prindples of the dis ig v google 176 social
rspdrm programs and movbhbnts tribulion of wealth most conducive to
human happiness 1824 contained a very clear state ment of
the famous marxian postulate of the doctrine of surplus valuc
he mainleiined that labor produces all value and should get
the whole product but under capitalistic so ciety it is
exploited out of a great part of its just income
louis blanc was one of the first to insist that
the only effective help which the proletariat could expect must
come from their own efforts he believed that the laboring
classes would have to triumph through revolu tion and his
postrevolutionary program con sisted in social woricshops which practically meant
slate support and control of industry according to a democratic
plan of organization in the french revolution of 1848 his
plan was tried but as it was operated by his
enemies who solely desired to discredit it the scheme proved
a hopeless failure proudhon made an especially bitter attack upon
the institution of private property or rather upon the abuses
of private properly which then existed but he was equally
critical of the doctrine of com munism he proposed to
base the income of everyone solely upon the amount of
labor per formed the unit value of which was to
be equal and uniform among all members of so ciety
he attempted to secure the establish ment of a national
banking system founded upon this labor script following the revolu
tion of 1848 but he failed utterly in this onslaught
upon the abuses of the bourgeois regime weitling a magdeburg
tailor who later came to the united states anticipated marx
by a comprehensive and trenchant re view of the evils
which modern industrialism had brought to the workingmen and by
au eloquent appeal to the proletariat urging them to rise
in eir own behalf and overthrow their capitalistic oppressors lasalle
stressed the fact that the laborers could only escape from
bond age through political activity and assumed a leading part
in urgiii and guiding the forma tion of a labor
par in germany his con crete plan for reform was
slate workshops much like those proposed by louis blanc but
this phase of his doctrines and activity had little subsequent
influence transitional social ism thus in many obvious ways prepared
eu rope for marxian socialism 4 early philosophies awtrchibm it
might be thought that the economic liberals had attained unto
the most perfect apotheosis of the individual but another contemporary
school exceeded them in this respect namely the earliest philosophical
anarchists the economic liberals proposed to retain the state for
at least the function or preserving life and protecting property
but the anarchists declared for the total abolition of the
state and alt coercive juristic institutions the first of this
group was william godwb 17561836 whose in quiry concerning political
justice 1793 was prolbly the best example of the adoption
of the extreme notions of the french revolution by an
eilish social philosopher he held that all evils in society
result from the detri mental effect of coercive human institutions
he proposed that all collective organizations larger than the parish
should be abolished that the unequal distribution of wealth should
be done away with that the institution of marrie should
be wiped out that manlcind should be free from everything
save the moral censure of their associates and thereby made
ready for their ultimate perfection through the influence of reason
proudhon inveighed mightily against the state which he regarded as
wholly an institution for exploitation and op pression his ideal
society was to be founded upon that combination which may
be created in metaphysics but which has never yet been
realized as a practical condition namely ihe union of order
and anarchy he believed that if the obligations of contract
could be en forced society would function perfectly but he
scarcely comprehended that until human nature has reached a higher
state of perfection there can be no certain enforcement of
con tractual obligations without the force of the law behind
them while both jodwin and proudhon had rejected the utility
of the stale they had stressed the importance of society
of the concept of humanity it was left for max
stirner 180556 in his the ego and his own 1844
to exalt the individual above even humanity and society to
assert that the individual constitutes the only extant reality to
maintain that the only limitation upon the rights of the
individual is his power to obtain what he desires and
to contend that the only right is might while these
early anarchists were guilty of many excesses of statement and
offered no wellreasoned substitute for the state which they proposed
to destroy they did pet form a real service in
insisting that the state as long as it was undemoc
rati zed was un justly oppressive and a legitimate object
for the suspicion of those who were excluded from participation
in it 5 the political revolutioiib of ibm in the
winter and spring of 1848 the masses throughout central southern
and western eu rope rose in ihe attempt to secure
for them selves freedom from oppression through par ticipation in
political activity in the german slates freedom from political autocracy
was desired in the hapsburg realms and in italy not
only political liberty but also freedom from the social and
economic burdens of feudalism were sumed at in france political
participa tion and the overthow of the oppression of the
bourgeoisie were the goal and in elngland the chartists hoped
to achieve economic better ment and that part in the
world of politics which had been denied to them in
the reform bill of 1832 for various reasons primarily from
a division of the revolutionists through national party or economic
rivalry the move ments failed in every country though the
aboli tion of serfdom in the hapsburg possessions was made
a permanent achievement the fail ure of these political revolts
of the masses turned many into a following of economic
channels of attack upon die forces of privi lege the
programs of social reform in the first half of the
19th century had cleared away the archaic obstructions inherent in
mercantilism and had made vigorous assaults upon the suc ceeding
rigime ot industrialism and economic liberalism from almost every angle
ranging from an ssthetic protest to political and eco d
google social reform programs and movbmbmts itt nomic rivalry in
england some progress had been made toward the beginnings of
construc tive factory legislation but elsewhere little had been achieved
along this line nowhere were worktnen freely allowed the nghc
of self protection through organisation in no t major european
country did political democracy exist in 1850 there were few
constructive programs of social reform of a concrete or practical
nature only in prussia was there any free ublic education
but in spite of these early ailures to achieve permanent
results the ground was being prepared for the rise of
those i reform movements which have brought the be ginnings
of economic as well as political de mocracy into the
modem world vi the rise of pbesentday sooal theories and
social reform programs l the historical background before i 1850
the new industrial order had thoroughly taken hold only of
england but had af i fected france to a considerable
degree the i other european countries were little affected by
i ibe industrial revolution until the last third of i
the century when the new industrialism came j to these
states it produced 3 wider following for the programs of
reform again the first i half of the century was
spent by the proletariat and their champions in groping about
feeling their way in formulating impracticable pro lt grattis and
in discovering successful methods of organization and achievement after 1850
i this preliminary training began to hear fruit in successful
proletarian movements in both the political and the economic fields
further the mad rush for wealth tended to slow down
lo some degree and even the capitalistic classes became more
resigned to the coming of a moderate restriction of their
absolute indus trial freedom finally the darwinian biology made any
static outloolc upon social and eco nomic problems absurd and
preposterous 2 the effect of the german philosoiriiy of the
state the political philosophy of both economic liberalism and utilitarianism
had been i built up about the thesis of the
preeminence of the individual and the state was looked upon
i as merely the communal policeman aside i from the
protection of life and properly and the i erection of
public works the chief function of i the state was
represented as being the abolition of restrictive legislation previously enacted
i the notion of the state as the chief instrument
i of social reform was wholly repulsive to this i
school and a new doctrine of the state was es
1 sentiai before extensive reform legislation could be given a
respectable theoretical founda tion this new theory of the state
was found in the doctrines of the german idealist political
philosophers particularly hegel here was discovered a notion of the
state which was wholly reverent took the community as the
starting point of pohlical reasoning and be lieved the individual
capable of finding per fection only as a member of
the state this view was brought over into england by
t h green f h bradley and bernard bosanquet prof
ernest baker thus summarizes the nature and significance of this
transformation in polit ical philosophy not a modification of the
old benthamite premises but a new philos ophy was needed
and that philosophy was provided by the idealist schooljf which
green is the greatest representative that school drew its inspiration
immediately from kant and hegel and ultimately from the old
greek philosophy of the citystate the vital relation between the
life of the individual and the life of the community
which alone gives the in dividual worth and significance because
it alone gives him the power of full moral de
velopment the dependence of the individual for all his rights
and for all his liberty on his membership of the
community the cor relative duty of the community to guarantee
to the individual all his rights in other words all
the conditions necessary for his and therefore for its own
full moral development these were the premises of the new
philosophy that philosophy could satisfy the new needs of social
progress because it refused to worship a supposed individual liberty
which was proving destructive to the real liberty of the
vast ma jority and preferred to emphasize the moral wellbeing
and betterment in and through the community herein lay or
seemed to lie a revolution of ideas instead of starting
from a central individual to whom the social system is
supposed to be adjusted the idealist starts from a central
social system in which the in dividual must find his
appointed orbit of duty this tgthilosophy laid the foundation for
state activity but it carried with it certain exaggera tions
and dangers which professors dewey and hobhouse have recently revealed
3 the rise of scientific sociology the genera sdenee of
society or sociology took its origin as professor small has
made clear from the social conditions and reform programs of
the first halt of the 19th century which called for
some objective science capable of weighing the merits and detecting
the defects in the many plans for social reform saintsimon
had recognized the need for such a science and it
was founded by his disciple auguste comte and by herbert
spencer though there can be no doubt that the science
would sooner or later have come into existence had these
men never written since their day sociology has at iracted
many students and many schools of sociologists nave developed each
embodying some fertile method of approach to the diverse problems
with which sociology must concern iteit comte spencer giddings ward
and hobhouse have developed comprehensive systems of social philosophy the
methodology of the science has been perfected by such men
as le play durkheim small simmel and the statisticians such
as quetclet jevons galton pearson bowley mayo smith willcox chad
dock hankins durand and others me bio local point of
approach has been cultivated by the organicists like ltlienfeld schaeffle
worms ana roberty and by their more critical successors psychological
sociology has been advanced by bagehot wallas trotter tonnies tarde
durkheim le bon sighele ross euwood cooley and sumner the
conflict be tween social groups and interests has been dealt
with by gumplowicz ratzenhofer oppen heimer small and bentley the
historical mode of approach has attracted thomas hobhouse giddings westermarck
and durkheim the significance of geographical factors has been shown
by ratzel reclus brunhes and semple d google social reform
programs and movemsntb while close contact with social reform has
been made by the scientific students of philanthropy like webb
devine and taylor and a sound basis for social legislation
has been formulated hy jethro blown pound freund and lindsay
tlie attitude of sociologists toward ptate activity has varied greatly
comte believed in a thorough program of social reform but
dar winian biolopy affected sociology much as new tonian mechanics
had affected oolitical and economic thought for two centuries before
sociologists of individualistic leanings like herbert spencer and william graham
sumner interpreted the darwinian dpc trine to mean that social
institutions like the animal organ ism evolved in a spontaneous
and automatic manner and that human efforts could onl be
harmful a view similar to that entertained by the physiocrats
toward interference with the natural order of physical and social
phenomena others particularly prots lester f ward and leonard t
hothouse have con tended that while the eariiest stages of
social evoluuon are spontaneous there comes a time when social
progress may be artificialiy con trolled and accelerated by the
conscious direc tion of mankind this dividing line will ap
parently be reached when statesmen shall have evolved into sociologists
most sociologists following jevons have avoided dogmatism on this point
and have shown that laissezfaire and state socialism are policies
which may each have their virtues in proportion as they
are adapted to a given society but sociologists are more
and more coming to leave the individualist point of view
and to stand with ward and hobbouse in favoring extensive
state activity while it can scarcely be said that every
sociolo gist is on that account a talented statesman it
is certain that no scientific program of social reform can
be formulatea independent of sociological investigations or divorced from sociological
principles 4 the development of marxian or scien tific socialism
the origins of the socajled scientific socialism are generally and
correctly associated with the work of karl marx 1818 83
and friedrich engels 182095 as prof bertrand russell has well
said socialism as a power in europe may be said
to begin with marx it is true that before his
time there were socialist theories both in england and in
france it is also true hat in france during the
revolution of 1848 socialism for a brief period acquired considerable
influence in the stale but the socialists who preceded marx
tended to indulge in utopian dreams and failed to found
any strong or stable political party to marx in collaboration
with engels are due both the formulation of a coherent
body of socialist doctrine sufficiently true or plausible to dominate
he minds of vast numbers of men and the formation
of the international socialist movement which has continued to grow
in all european countries throughout the last so years it
would probably be futile to attempt to indicate all the
sources of marxs views for he read deeply in all
the hterature of his age and was in contact with
most of the tendencies of bis period but a few
of his more conspicu ous obligations may be set down
to hegel he was indebted for his dialectical system and
his faith in state activity his materialistic the 1a1gtor theory
oi value was derived from ricardo and rodbertus the doctrine
of surplus value was found by marx in the writings
of thompson the notion of a class conflict and of
the necessity of a proletarian upheaval was found in the
works of louis blanc proudhon and weitling while from sismondi
he re ceived bis conviction that the capitalists would be
weakened by the progressive concentration of wealth in the hands
of a few men of great possessions the communist manifesto
a document drawn up by marx and eiigels for the
german communist league in paris in january 1848 contained the
essence of marxian socialism this begins with the terpretation of
history the contention that the prevailing systems of the production
and dis tribution of wealth determine the accommny ini social
and political institutions then comes the labor theory of value
the belief that labor produces all value from this is
derived the doctrine of surplus value by pointing to the
difference between the total social income and that received by
labor this difference is the surplus value created by labor
and out of viliich it is exploited by the capitalist
hence there arises the notion of an inevitable and ir
reconcilable struggle between the proletariat and the capitalists this cannot
but terminate in the overthrow of the latter for they
are being continually weakened by the steady con centration of
wealth in the hands of their more powerful representatives while
the proletariat will become progressively stronger through party organization and
the obtaining of the suf frage when they shall have
secured a ma jority in the lawmaking bodies of the
several states the proletariat will rise up and expro predicicd
but wisely refrained from describing in detail these doctrines were
elaborated with greater thoroughness and in more ponderous and obscure
language in the work on capital begun by marx anct
completed by engels the enduring theoretical contributions of marx are
his economic interpretation of history and his extremely effective criticism
of the individual istic industrialism of the first half of
the 19th century the latter of which cannot but stir
into fury any passionate workingclass reader and into unbearable shame
any possessor of capital in whom generosity and justice are
not wholly extinct few if any of marxs other major
doctrines are now regarded as possessing sub stantial validity marx
was also instrumental in establishing origins for a conference of
laborers at the london international exhibition of 1862 it was
organized at london two years later and its principles were
drawn up by marx and adopted at the geneva conference
two years afterward a german witig started hy wil liam
liebknecht in 1864 and under his leader ship and that
of august bebel it was developed into the democratic workingmens
association at eisenach in 1869 in the meantime a ger
man general worwngmens association had been organized and its program
enunciated by lasalle in 1863 these two groups coalesced at

bismarck from 1878 to 1890 ihey grew in power until
they commanded 110 out of 397 votes in the reich
stag of the otd empire and have now captured in
a seemingiy permanent manner the german government the beginnings of
the modern french political organization of labor dates back lo
1878 two years later french marxianism was originated under the
leadership of jules guesde but the french socialists for a
long time were unable to arrive at the same unity
that char acterized the party in germany numerous sects developed
and there grew up much bitter feeling particularly between the
marxians led by guesde and the revisionists or opport these
factions failed in 1899 but met with more success in
1905 and the united socialist party was able to elect
102 out of 602 members of the chamber of deputies
in 1914 besides 18 mem bers of the alhed independent
socialist party the socialist party organisation has made rapid progress
in a number of the other chief european countries notably
austria italy and russia and has reached remarkable strength in
some of the lesser states particularly finland sweden denmark and
belgium in part this has been the result of the
increased strength of the proletariat and in part the etiect
of a moderation of socialistic proposals which has attracted many
liberals who refuse to accept uarxian postulates 5 the english
fabians and the growth of reyiwonist socialiani in spite of
the significance of marxian socialism in attracting a sufficient following
to make it a political and economic movement of the
greatest importance it possessed certain obvious theoretical diffi culties which
embarrassed its more thoihtful supporters and rave its enemies a
vulnerable point of attack these weaknesses were chiefly the untenable
labor theory of value and the deductions from it and
the refusal of the marxians lo cooperate with existing capital
istic governments in securing remedial legisla tion for the projetaiiat
a program of re form which was not to begin
until after a re mote and complete social revolution bad
been achieved was much less attractive than oie which would
accept partial amelioration on the road lo complete triumph this
situation was first adequately compre hended by a group of
english radicals known as the fabian society they organized out
of a general sympathy with socialistic propositions which had been
brought before them in part by english followers of marx
like william morris and h m hyndman and in pari
by two american radicals henry george and thomas davidson the
most important mem bers of this group were sidney webb
graham wallas bernard shaw oiioiza money ed ward pease h
g wells and stewart head lam thev derived theit name
from the roman leader fabius and their resolution to delay
their final convictions until the socialistic movement had developed further
they relied chiefly upon the hope of arousing an intellectual
movement in favor of radical social reform and their great
significance lies in the fact that they repudiated the fatalism
of marx and came out for opporiunism or remedial social
legislation through he agency of the existing political organization they
made socialism an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary move ment
they were also less enamored with the internationalism oc marx
and laid greater stress upon national progress in social reform
while the fabians originated the tenets of revisionism the spread
of this movement was due more to the agitation of
a german socialist savant edouard bernstein 1850 bern stein uved
in npland during the period of the socialist persecution in
germany and was con verted to the ideas of the
fabians returning to germany in the early nineties he began
the dissemination of his new convictions and in his work
on evolutionary socialism he system atized his principles which were
chiefly a de nial of the marxian economics especially the
labor theory of value a declaration for op porlunism or
piecemeal remedial social les lalion a willingness to coopera i
e with existing governments and more concessions to the prin
ciples of nationalism and patriotism than the marxians would allow
in other words he aimed at the practical transformation of
social ism from a proletarian party of revolution into a
party of radical social reform which could attract the support
of nonmarxian liberals while he was not able to capture
the german socialist party until after the death of bcbel
and the elder liebknecht the marxians now constitute a hopeless
minority among german socialists and many of the revisionists have
even passed bernstein in the degree lo which ihey have
modified the marxian doctrine and program the general history of
socialism in every important modern state has been much like
that of german socialism marxianism has served as the entering
propaganda and the growth of the movement has led to
the domina tion of revisionism only in russia where socialism
did not have long enough a period of development to
allow the triumph of oppor tunism have the marxians remained
in the majority the leading revisionist socialists have been jauris
in france emiie vandervclde in belgium filippo tutati in italy
and peter struve and m tuganbaranovsky in russia the intellectual
leaders of socialism in the united states have also generally
capitulated to revisionism though the majority of the party clings
to marxian principles thus as sociausm has increased in strength
it has de veloped moderation this has been due in
part to the greater validity and practicality of revisionism and
in part to the very growth of socialist power for
as professor orih has well put it ambition brings power
power brings re sponsibility responsibility sobers the senses socialism has
in this manner been purged of the nightmare of revolution
except in russia and while it is undoubtedly increasing in
strength almost everywhere it can no longer frighten any person
except the one who opposes the ven principle of progress

related to the principles and program of revisionist socialism and
in part contributing to the growth and vitality of the
former is he socalled slate socialism the chief difference between
them is that state socialism has primarily come from radical
bourgeoisie instead of moderate socialists digit zed google 180 social
rkporm programs amd movements thoi it must be remembered that
in some cases most notably in that of bismarckiaii social
legislation state socialism has been used to aid autocracy and
check radicalism the same general prcram of remedial legislation is
proposed n both though their ultimate goal is sligntly dinerenl
the revisionist hopes for an ultimate proletarian state but plans
to ease as touch as possible the passage of the
capitahst over the jordan of social democracy while the state
socialist hopes to retain the capitalistic system with great concessions
to the laboring dasses state socialism received some consider able
impulse from lasalle but its chief earlv leaders were the
german karl johann roa bertus 180575 and the frenchman charles
brook dupontwhite 180778 more re cently the program of state
socialism has re ceived not only the support of statesmen
in the german progressive pa the french socialist radical party
and the iglish liberal parly but also in different degrees
from the profes sorial champions of social reform within the
capitalistic state the socalled socialists of the chair such as
schaeffle wagner and schmol ler in germany bougie and gide
in france webb hobson and hobbouse in england and fetter
fisher patten seligman and seager in the united stales state
socialism in actual legislative achieve ment has made the greatest
progress in ger many where there has been enacted an
elaborate program of social legislation covering almost every phase of
protection to the laboring classes it has also included the
adoption of the stale ownership of railroads and other pub
lic utilities and a vast amount of municipal socialism france
has made extensive progress in this direction in the latter
half of the period of the third republic and italy
as well es pecially in the libera regime since 1900
aus tria has followed much of the example of ger
many in this movement while in england the home of
economic liberalism even the party of cobden has been converted
to state socialism dirough a process of change which professor
hobhouse has clearly explained its vigorous leader david lloyd george
has secured in the period since 1905 the adoption of
a legislative reform program designed to make cobden turn in
his grave and rivaled in content onhr by german achievements
in the united states state socialism made scant progress until
the accident at buffalo put mr roosevelt in the presidential
chair down to thai time theplulo cratic admirers of the
philosophy of cobden and bright such as roscoe conkling and
mark hanna nad maintained individualism iu a po mtion of
dominance while mr roosevelt atjiieved relatively little in the way
of rosilive remedial lepslation he aroused ihe spirit of the
people in this direcuon and made possible the very considerable
progress in advanced social legislation which has taken place in
mr wilsons administration of all the enemies of the political
postulates of economic liberalism state socialism has to date been
the most deadly in practical results 7 recent developments of
christian so cialism the growth of social problems and the
development of programs of relief have not been without their
reaction upon ecclesiastical orguuiationi and policies since 1850 the catholic
party has been especially active in this matter in germany
adolph kolping 181365 proposed assoaations of young worldngmen for religious
as well as economic betterment bishop von ketteler 181177 f
c j moufang 181790 and frani hitie 1851 advocated not
only social legislation but also the organization of idsociausm under
catholic auspices but with stale financial sup port as the
best agency for solving modem mdusirial evils the program was
designed in part to weaken the slate the secular rival
of the church and in part to attract the proletariat
to the ecclesiastical authorities the catholic party in germany has
been strong est in bavana from which the center party
always an exponent of social reform has been chiefly recruited
in austria karl lueger 18441910 adopted the program of the
or man catholic gild social sis and organized tbt powerful
austrian christian socialist party in france frederic leplay 180682 pro
posed to solve modem social and economic problems by developing
the family group an organization midway between the old patri
archal family and ihe modem family organiza tion but much
more important than this for social reform was his method
of stuctying social problems for he is ripjitly regarded as
the real originator of the social survey method of social
investigation much more influential has been the work of albert
de mun 1841 1914 who accepted the gild socialist program
and organized the action librale franise virtually the catholic socialist
parly of france hibire belloc and gilbert chesterton have tried
without success to organize a similar movement in england even
the liberal pope leo xin in his euctciical rerum novarum
sent out in 1891 advocated remedial social legislation for the
laboring classes espoused the program of gildsocialism and maintained the
spedal solicitude of the catholic church for the lowly laborer
whether urban or agrarian the social impulse has also affected
prot estanism in recent times in germany the fanatical hoheniollern
court preacher stocker organized what was called a christian social
workingmens party but which was in reality more antisemitic than
either chris tian or socialist friederich naumann in the nineties
also made an unsuccessful attempt to capture german protestantism for
a radical social reform policy in france the protestants have
been noted for their philanthropic organizations but they have never
been strong enough to create a powerful parly of social
reform in england the work of maurice and kingsley has
been carried on by aggressive anglicans like bishops west colt
and gore who founded the christian socialist union in 1889
and like john neville figgis who formulated an elaborate theoretical
justification of what might be called ecclesi astical syndicalism in
america christian socialism was founded in the late eighties by
josiah strong and profs richard t ely and jeorge d
herron and received its most effect ive support from prof
walter rauchenbusch in his famous works christianity and the social
crisis and christianizing the social order other adherents to this
point of view dy google social reform proorahs and hovieheht8
161 have been professots francis peabody of har vard c
r henderson and shailer matthews of qiicago harry ward of
boston e l earp of drew and p a parsons
of syracuse the social point of view has attracted religious
radicals as well as conservatives indeed it ls probable that
the critical adherents lo chris tian doctrines are the most
inclined to stress the social phases in oiristianity for with
them the sodal and ethical detnents are about all that
remains to be saved and expanded 8 the newer anarchism
and the at tacks upon the bourgeois national state modern
anarchism is a revolt against the op pressiveness of the
agrarian or oie capitalistic state it is most significant that
the two leadii figures in the development of the modem
anarchist movement have been russians at a time when modern
industrialism was creating new problems and bringing the necessity of
modem democracy nearer to hand the russian autocracy tried to
maintain a system of gov ernment as medizval and intolerant
as at the lime of peter the great michael bakunin
181476 was the revolutionary propagandist ue propaganda of hatred for
the state organization of a movement committed to its destruction
to him the stale appeared as the great and central
engine of human oppression and its elimination seemed the one
chief need of he time once the state was removed
the task of the reconstruction of society on anarchistic principles
could safely be left to the future generations hence the
work of bakunin was chieflj the dissemination of the gospel
at de struction his views being most systematically expressed in
his god and the state where he maintained loyalty to
state and religion to be the chief obsiacles to social
progress and human liberty prince peter kropotkin lt1843 is the
chief systematic and constructive writer on modern anarchism according to
him ihe ideal organization of society is the noncoercivc com
munity without private property and function ing perfectly through the
operation of the pnnciple of mutual aid or cooperation to
support his position he has not only made a theoretical
defense of his system but has also executed a thorough
historical study of the im portance of the principle of
mutual aid from ihe first animal societies to the present
day and has brought forward a wealth of evidence to
prove this the chief factor in social evolution the happy
operation of which was terminated by the rise of the
modem dynastic and capital tsiic state which has created most
subsequent evils without in any way contributing to their effective
removal the communistic coopera tive and nonpolitical group then is
the goal of the philosophical anarchist human nature hav ing
been perverted by political institutions the removal of the tatter
will restore the pristine virtues of the race a notion
not far removed from the burden of rousseaus famous second
discourse the anarchistic views have also re ceived the support
of such writers as the rus uan leon metchnikos and
the frenchmen elisee reclus and jean grave the economic prcram
of the anarchists is not greatly discr cnt from that
of the socialists as far as the in stitution of
private property is concerned but their political ideals are diametrically
opposed the socialist proposes a vast increase in state activity
while the anarchist desires the complete extinction of political authority
and the substi tution of voluntary cooperation the anarchists have
erred in generalizing too much from rus sian conditions which
have been incomparably worse than in the more democratic states
of western europe further their movement is entirely unadapted to
modem conditions they are dther antiquated or greatly ahead of
their time voluntarily cooperation may have been gssme in a
small primitive group or it may practicable in the far
distant future when human nature shall have been perfected but
scarcely at the present time when imperfect humanity faces a
complexity of problems of unprecedented volume and when the state
is more than ever necessary the anarchists have done good
in showing how much oppression has resulted from autocratic states
and in stressing the unexploited potentiakiies of cooperation but the
remedy would seem to lie in the im provement of
the state through democracy and decentralization rather than in the
extinction of political authority 9 the development of tradeunioiuun and
its relation to social reform it was one of the
cardinal points of economic liberal ism that perfect freedom of
contract should prevail in the economic relations of employer and
employee but in actual practice the freedom was chiefly that
of the employer to reject the services of the employee
where one party to the contract coula refrain from participation
with equanimity while the other party would be threatened with
starvation there could be neither freedom nor equality of contract
un organized labor was thus wholly at the metcy of
the capitalistic employer on the other hand if the laborers
could combine and withhold the services not merely of one
man but of a large number the concern of the
employer over the failure to make the labor contract could
be greatly increased while the suffering of the employees could
be lessened through coopera tion in bearing the mutual loss
the desire to meet the employer on relatively equal terms
has been the central impulse in the development of modem
tradeunionism the question has often been raised as to the
relation between the modem tradeunions and the older id otni
zations it has been shown pretty conclusively that there was
no genetic connection between them in england there was a
long hiatus be tween the end of the gilds and
the origin of unions and even on the continent there
is little evidence that tradeunions grew up out of previous
gild organizations in england tradeunionism was early pro hibited by
the combination laws of 1799 and 1800 in 1824 francis
place and joseph hume smuggled an act through parliament legalizing
organization but this was repealed in the fol lowing year
owens attempt to stimulate unionism in the thirties failed in
the sixties the cause of unionism was taken up by
the socalled junta made up of alien applegarth coulson guile
and odger by acts of 1871 and 1875 organization and
strikes were legalized though the reactitmaries in tbt dgt google
social reform programs and movements taff vale and the osborne
cases 1901 and 1909 tried to weaken the unions iha
liberal party in legislation following 1905 has practi cally abrogated
the effects of these decisions today labor organization is probably
the most effective aid lo the english urban proletariat at
the outbreak of the world war these unions had about
3000000 members in france an act of 1864 gave the
laborers the right to organiie and a later law of
1884 authorized them to strike since that time there has
been a great increase in the number of unionists accottipa
nied by a bitter struggle between those who cung to
orthodox raelhods and those who incline to ward the greater
radicalism of the syndicalist movcmenl the french labor unions now
boast of over 1000000 members in germany trade unionism was
originally little impeded by oppos ing legislation but il came
under the ban dur ing the antisocialist campaign from 1878
to 1890 since then it has been little restricted uost
of the german unionists are organized in social democratic or
free unions eirftirac ing about 2000000 members in no other
im portant country have the unionists so faithfully maintained the
ideals of excellent craftsman ip which were so characteristic of
the me dieval gilds tradeunionism has spread to most other
european countries though in many especially in the romance nations
it has tended toward syndicalism in the united states extensive
labor organization began following the civil war with the kniis
of labor an oreanization which declined after the violent stnkes
of 1s86 their place was taken by the american federation
of labor an organisation which now numbers about 2500000 the
policies of labor unions have centred about two main avenues
of attack upon the capitalists matters of immediate interest such
as wage agreements with employers are ar ranged either by
peaceful collective bargaining or by more violent action such as
strikes and boycotts for the more general advancement of the
status of the proletariat they rely upon the possibility of
obtaining legislation favorable to the interests of the laboring classes
which of these two policies is most stressed varies with
different unions and ui different countries but on the whole
it is probable that the strike policy has predominated the
degree to which the tradeunions have attempted to gain polit
ical power has differed widely with time and nation in
germany most unionists are mem bers of the social democratic
party in france orthodox unionists tend to affiliate with the
socialists while the radicals who incline toward syndicalism eschew all
political activity in england the unionists have a more or
less dis tinct labor party of considerable proportions in the
united states samuel gompers has at tempted to keep the
american federation of labor out of distinct political activity though
he has several times declared his own prefer ence for
candidates at presidential elections an accessory but very important feature
of tradeunionism has been the development of fraternal and cooperative
activities among members attempt to prevent violence through making arbitration
of labor disputes compulsory hai met with only temporary and
local success most notably in australasia though the tendencies seem
to be moving in this general direction again many powerful
employers and associa tions of employers have even yet so
little adjusted their economic orientation to the modern industrial world
that they refuse to recognize the validity of the principles
or the practices of labor organizations as a result the
relations between capital and labor are too frequently of the
nature of sliehtly mitigated industrial warfare finally while there can
be little doubt that labor organizations have done more than
anything else to advance the material interests of the laboring
classes in the last half centuiy and hve been the
most potent factor in promoting industrial democracy yet trade unionism
is bound to be unsatisfactory to those who do not
believe in merely alleviating the misery of the proletariat but
hope to over throw the whole modem capitalistic order orthodox
tradeunionism aims chiefly to im prove the lot of the
laborer within a capitalistic industrial society but accepts the implied
per sistence of this order therefore those who wish the
institution of a society controlled by the proletariat and desire
to achieve this revo lution by economic means rather than
by the political methods of socialism have tended to leave
tradeunionism and go over to the more radical labor movemeni
which has found its greatest strength in syndieriism 10 the
development of syndicaliam and the radical labor movement syndicalism which
originated as a french labor movement and has since spread
to other countries par ticularly italy and america is the
most recent radical proletarian movement of any significant proportions to
develop syndicalism resembles socialism in desiring to end the present
capital istic economic order it bears some similarity to tradeunionismin
believing that the economic point of attack is most likely
to be most effect ive and in using labor organization
as the chief instrument for gathering the forces of the
pro letariat it is like anarchism in desiring the abolition
of political forms of control over mankind it differs from
socialism in reject ing the efficacy of political activity and
in re fusing to accept state socialism even in a
pro letarian state it diverges from tradeunionism in favoring as
the unit of organiation the in dustrial rather than the
craft union and in aiming to get rid of the
capitaustic employer altogether and while hearing a closer relation to
anarchism than to socialism it does not pro pose so
thorough an abolition of all existing in stitutions as the
anarchist desires and it seems likely to retain a far
greater amount of au thorative control over the members of
the syndicalist society even thou it may try to evade
this in theory by refusing lo designate such control as
governmental or political the historical origins of french syndicalism are
not difficult to understand a vigorous theory of the necessity
of a class war had come down from proudhon the
many fac tions into which french socialists had split and
the bitter animosity which developed between them weakened the cause
of the proletariat and the socialist cause was further discredited
d google social reform proorau3 and movements 188 with the
radical laboring element because for mer socialists like uillerand and
briand had been willing when they entered the frendi government
to use the forces of the capitalistic state against radical
labor revolts therefore there arose a determination among a large
num ber of french tabor leaders to cum their back
upon all political activiiv and to distrust polit ical methods
of reliei whether from state socialism or marxian revolutionary hopes
at the close of the eighties labor exchanges were organized
first in paris and later throughout the leading french cities
to act as a general clearinghouse for local labor prob
lems and policies in 1892 they established a national organization
the federation of la bor exchanges fidiration dts bourses du
travaii this movement was guided by ferdi nand pellontier 18671901
a french disciple of communist anarchism at about the same
time another radical labor organization was developing in france this
was the general confederation of labor conftdiratiom cin trale du
travaii founded in 1895 by a union of some 700
french local industrial unions or syuiicals from which the syndicalist
move ment gets its name in 1902 the federation of
labor exchanges and the general confedera tion of labor united
and became the basis of the organized syndicalist movement the
syste matic theorist of french syndicalism is georges sorel 1847
the syndicaksts eschew any attempt to come to favorable terms
with their capitalistic em ployers in any settlement which may
be re garded as permanent they aim frankly and openly
at conducting a class war by industrial lethods which will
sooner or later drive the the unit of organization at
which the syndi calists aim is the industrial union the
general organization of all laborers in a given industry which
it is hoped will give greater strength and less division
of interests than craft union ism their method of carrying
on the class war is the socalled direct action the
two chief types of which are sabotage and the general
strike the former is more of a temporary instrument designed
to serve until the general strike finally drives the capitalist
from the field it consists in every type of harassing
the employer from serious injury to machinery to slow and
inferior workmanship in production while some employers might be discouraged
and abandon the fight merely as the result of sabotage
a more vigorous method will be needed to deal with
the more obdurate capitalists and with the state and for
this pur pose the syndicalists propose to resort to the
genera strike which is not merely a suspension of labor
to improve locl conditions but a general cessation of work
which would place 5ie country in the rigor of death
whose terrible and incalculable consequences would force the government to
capitulate at once wre the syndicausts successful in destroying the
capital istic order they would institute a communistic economic sbciety
and a governmental organisa tion based upon the industrial system
as pro fessor orth has well expressed it syndicalists believe
in a local or communal government their state is a
glorified trade union whose confined to economic functions their nation
is a collection of federated com munal trade societies they
would then take government out of the frontdoor of the
state lo bring it in by the backdoor of industrial
regimentation of all the radical modern re form movements syndicalism
has come the nearest to translating the class war into
prac tical concrete action and it is that form of
or ganization and procedure into which the capital ists should
most hesitate to drive the laboring classes aside from its
own specific program syndicalism has attracted a sympathetic study from
many who are not willing to accept its whole economic
program but feel that some thing must be done to
decentralize the over grown and unwieldy modem national state and
to give representative government a more rational basis through allowing
the representa tion of economic interests and classes further many
exponents of the more orthodox trade unionism feel that they
would gain greatly by giving up the craft union organization
and ac cepting the principles of the industrial union organization
while syndicalism began as dis tinctly a french movement it
has spread into other european countries notably italy in the
united states it has been adopted by a con siderable
group the industrial workers of the world from the combined
influence of france and the united states syndicalism has built
up a considerable following in great britain 11 gildso cialiun
s a compromim b tween socialism and syndicaliim the generally
known as gild socialism is in its essence an economic
decentraliza and the solution of the labor problem mediieval gilds
adapted to the changed conditions of modem industrialism such a
proposal dates back to the first half of the 19tli
century when it was foreshadowed by some of the propositions
of the english christian so cialists and ruskiti especially congenial
hat gild socialism been to modem catholic social been defended
in a modified form by the french sociologist mile durkheim
while it has par ticularly attracted the younger british labor
leaders such as mr cole and his associates in its
modem and elaborated form it aims to effect a reconciliation
between state socialism and syndicalism the political control and ad
ministration which represents society as con sumers and which receives
the chief atten tion of the socialists will be retained
by the state the management of industrial affairs which pertains
to society as producers and is represented by syndicalism will
be turned over to gilds or associations of workingmen properly
federated into national organizations this will give essential industrial autonomy
above both political and economic authority will be a jcunt
committee composed of representatives of the state and the gilds
which will have the final decision on disputed points and
on those vital matters which concern the citizens as both
pro ducers and consumers to many gildsocial ism seems the
most promising of the modem reform policies and a clever
synthesis of two of the most powerful of radical reform
pro grams others however deny the possibility of any real
separation of political and indus trial functions as prof ernest
barker has igic social reform prograhs and movements expressed it
any doctrine of separation of powers such as guildsocialism advocates
is mund to collapse before ihe simple fact of the
vital intcrtkpendence of all the activities of the great society
of today either the state must go as syndicalists seem
to advocate and that means chaos or the state tnust
remain and then if you are to have socialism it
must be statesocialism gt 12 hctuy george the single tu
and land nationalization the great majority of radical reform prcrams
in recent times have centred about attacks upon the methods
of pro duction and distribution of the earnings in man
ufacturing industry apd commercial enter prises but these ignored certain
sources of mod ern social problems and evident causes of
pov erty and misery involved in the unequal and undemocratic
methods of landholding there fore it was natural that at
least one important reform program should revolve about the pro
posal to reconstruct the methods of landhold ing to bring
them more into harmony with mod ern democratic principles the
leader in this movement was a brilliant and energetic ameri
can henry george 183997 living in cali fornia in the
early days of its civic and indus trial development he
was struck with the great increase in land values that
took place from purely social causes in less than a
decade com ing to new york the same phenomena attracted
his attention in the extreme land values created by social
and economic concentration on man hattan island so forcibly was
he struck by these facts that he came to regard
this increase of real estate values and its absorption by
pri vate persons as the chief cause of poverty and
thinkers differ from henry george primarily in holding that the
singletax should not be re garded as the sole remedy
for modem social problems though the majority of them would
agree that society should in some manner ab sorb these
socially created values known as the unearned increment and all
would give him credit for having called attention to the
fact that the capitalistic manufacturer or merchant is not wholly
responsible for the evils and mis en of the present
order much of the vitality of the single tax discussion
has however been subsetuentiy destroyed by changed economic conditions particularly
the relative decrease in the proportional importance of landed as
com pared with other forms of wealth and the grow
ing fluidity and legal elusiveness of the present modes of
landholding 13 bourgeois attempt to absorb the radical proletarian movements
it could scarcely be supposed that the middle class would
sit by and idly contemplate the growth of these threatening
proletarian programs and movements without attempting to counteract ihem without
trying as one thinker has ex pressed it to set
a backflre probably the chief instrument which has been used
has been state socialism or legislation desired to aid and
placate the labonng class while retaining the essence of the
capitalistic system though it must not be forgotten that much
state social ism has been a result of proletarian or
land lord attacks upon the middle class the bour geoisie
have hoped to lead the proletariat to trust to the
adequacy of the national capitalistic state as an agent for
promoting the cause of social reform and the growth of
industrial de 1879 the general abolition of other forms of
revenue and the imposition of a socalled sin gletax on
land which would turn into the public treasury the unearned
or social incre ment in land values this process would
ulti mately drive the landlord out of existence and pave
the way for the democratic nationaliza tion of land georges
theories attracted the greatest amount of interest in england where
uie evils he attacked were especially prevalent and where the
liberal party found a modified version of his doctrines a
fine instrument to be used in attacking their traditional enemies
the tory or conservative landlords among his followers was the
famous scientist alfred rus sel wallace but it remained for
david lloyd george to give these doctrines some prelimi nary
application in legislation in the small holding act of 1907
and in his budget of 1909 he made a definite
attack upon the vested landed interests at the outbreak of
the world war he was preparing a radical program of
agrarian reform for great britain but the close of the
conflict found him detached from the reform party and sitting
at the peace conference with two of the most tenacious
adherents to agrarian autocracy in england arthur j balfour and
bonar law in the meantime the bolshevik government in russia
had proceeded to carry ttirough a plan of actual land
nationalization but it would seem that this was much more
a product of the peculiar aims of the agrarian so
datist or social revolutionary party in rus sia than it
was of the direct aooption of the views of henry
george most progressive and to aid modem scientific philanthropy in
the hope that such measures will both lessen mis ery
and hence the pressure for reform and will attract the
gratitude of those who receive aid such benefactions have not
been made solely for the relict of physical privation and
suffer ing but even for the intellectual and recrea tional
improvement of the lower classes through libraries y m c
a organizations playgrounds and parks then the more progressive and
farsighted leaders of modem industrialism have developed policies of industrial
conciuation designed either to placate the laborers or to get
them practically interested in the preservation of the existing order
the best known of such methods are profitsharing cooperation scien
tific management and industrial welfare work some have even gone
so far as to foster the growth of conservative tradeunionism
such as is represented by the american federation of labor
of course many of the modem capitalists still hold tenaciously
with strange fatuity to the attitude of tohn bright and
de clare for a war to the ena with stale
socialism and industrial democracy this group can be trusted to
decline with rapidity or if they show an unexpected tendency
to increase they may safely be left to the tender
mercies of syndi calists and i w ws finally a
philosophy has been evolved designed to effect a liberal compromise
between capitalism and labor which has received its chief elaboration
in france where it is generally spoken of as the
doctrine of solidansm it takes its orifpt from the doc
trines of comte the positivists and leroux dp ecg00glc 60cul
rbfosh psogkahs and hovbhsnts regarding the organic unity of human
inter ests it was further elaborated by the sociolo osts
of the organic st schcxil and has recently men expanded
by ln bourgeois from the ugai point of view by
charles gide from the standpoint of the progressive econoioist by
inile durkhdm as a profound sociologist in terested in piactical
social reform and very recently by uie germap nicolai from
a sodo biologicaj point of approach this doctrine aitns at
an honest and thoroughgoing attempt to reform the present order
so as lo grant essential economic and social justice to
the proletariat while retaining the tmdoubtedl superior directive and inventive
ability of capi taustic enterprise in its practical program it
proposes on the one hand an extension of remedial social
legislation through state social ism and on the other a
great extension of the principle of voluntary cooperatiotl its adher
ents also generally incline toward some consid erable decenlraliiation of
the administrative powers and functions of the modem national slate
some members of the group lean rather distinct toward gild
socialism and the rep resentation of economic groups and interests
all in all it is the one program of reform
which embraces the interests of both capitalists and proletariat and
which is at the same time suffiaently honest disinteresiicd and
progressive to entitle it to respectful consideration k l4 the
great war and policies of re cotutniction the world war
at some time in the future will probablf be regarded
by the historian as having constituted a crisis or a
dividing tine in the history of modem sodal reform movements
but it is too early to predict just what the
nature of the succeeding re form movement will be it
will doubtless be seen by future historians that back of
the stniggle of nations was what may have been the
beginning of the final struggle between the present sodal and
economic cuuses a struggle in which landlord and capitalist united
against the common enemy in the proletariat that the feudal
landlord has generally succumbed in the of the struggle except
in england is aliyi of inoividuahslic industrialism is apparent from
what is usually taken as the tnost profound utterance of
labor during the war the report of the subcommittee of
the british labor party on reconstruction the individualist system of
capitalist production based on the private own ership and competitive
administration of land and capital with its reckless profiteeringgt and
wageslavtrry with its aloritication of the un hampered struggle for
the means of life and its tpocritical pretense of the
survival of the httest with the monstrous inequality of dr
cnmatances which it produces and the de dalion and brutalization
both moral and spirit ual resulting therefrom may we hope
indeed have received a death blow with it must go
the political system and ideas in which it natu rally
found expression they expressed the further significant opinion that what
has to be reconstructed after the war is not this
or that government department or this or thai gece of
social machinery but society itself furdier during the struggle as
a result oe the necessity of maintaining the production of
necessary munitions at the highest level ab normal concessions had
to be made to labor a situation which did not
tend to make the imgt letariat particularly inclined to acquiesce
in any later restoration of the sodal and economic ilattu
quo ante bellum all countries were com pelled to undertake
what in times of peace would have been regarded as
alarming steps toward complete state sodalism in russia the feudal
autocracy was overthrown and there followed the first attempt in
history to apply marxian sociahim to t of revisionist socialism
in the german political system the capitalists did not fail
to recognize these various challenges to dieir very existence as
a powerful organized class nor did they hesi tate to
take steps to protect tbdr system thdr most effective program
was to muce patriotism just as far as possible synonomous
with rigid adherence to a belief in the sanctity of
the capitalistic stem and to brand all expressions of proletarian
discontent and all plans for radical social reconstruction as products
of dis loyalty or vile enemy propaganda radical leaders were
assassinated or sentenced to ions terms of imprisonment for criticisms
of ad ministrative policy of a much milder character than
were passed by unnoticed when uttered by political opponents who
were members of capitalistic parties severe espionage laws were passed
which were little ntihied to aid the miliary department but
were widely made use of to silence expressions of social
and economic discontent the close of the conflict left a
serious situation a proletariat deter mined to end an oppressive
sodal and economic order and an organiied effort of capitalists
to preserve the system to which they owed thdr economic
resources and political prestige the bolution of this problem is
what now faces the world with the coming of peace
and this solution is bound to be of infinitely eater
significance for the history of modem civiliza tion than the
redisiribution of national bound aries by the peace conference whether
the adjustment wilt be made in a peaceful manner through
a liberal compromise in which both parties will concede much
or whether it will be made by violence in a
bitter class war which cannot but end in the termination
of capitalism in a most unfortunate manner will depend wholly
upon the sagadly and statesmanship of those who will lead
in the negotiations what plans of reconstruction will be most
used cannot be foreseen the problem has called forth a
reconsideration of every one of the proposals of the 19th
century which have been discussed above not even excepting a
return to the complete iudiyiduahsm of the economic libeials a
final lesson regarding sodal reform pro kams has been taut
by the world war and al is as professor hobhouse
pointed out a number of years ago in his democracy
and re action that the slate is bound to be
obstructed in effective programs of social reform as long js
militarism menaces our civilization as long as citizens are bowed

warfare or to support vast armaments for prepared ness there

existence of all the states with their separate legislatures affords
a vast held for sodal service by helping all to
profit by the i experience of each most of the
great prob lems of all the slates are substantially the

capital and the like some states are much in advance
in one particular others in another what if in each
particular all the states could be brought up to the
stand ard of the most advanced state j how would
the nation leap forward in civilization for instance the experience
of several states has demonstrated the valne of juvenile courts
and of industrial legislation for children in the natara course
of things it takes years for such reforms to reach
the more backward states whereas the institute with the necessary
funds conld doubtless educate public opinion so as to secure
the desired lemslation in onequarter of the time as president
roosevelt says in a letter to the institute the possibilities
of the institnte are well nigh boundless it is ap
parently proving to be the beginning of a world movemcrl
and is being recognized by the best men of many
different countries as a necessity in each and all of
these countries in order to fadhtate a readjustment of sodal
relations to social and university settle ments sodal service is
the modern study of people and conditions looking toward the
betterment of mankind a forward movement dealing with life occupation
and environment embracii the observation and investigation of the relations

children education in stitutional churches and the like the houses
or buildings whence all these activities are directed are known
as social settlements and the fact that university men were
and are prominent in the movement has caused them to
be known fretjuentiy as university settlements the necessity for systematized
social service was impressed originally upon the minds of englishmen
due to the enormous increase in the indigent and submerged
class in london and in other large dties of great
britain wfiicli became apparent soon after the great expansion of
the factory system there in oie first half of ciq

studying the difficulties besftting them among the prominent leaders of
the movement in england were arnold toynbee charles kingsley john
ruslrin thomas hughes kckcns carlyle thomas arnold thomas hill green
and edward dennison a growing sense of social duty and
responsibility actuated these men in calling attention to the many
social evils of their period in 1864 dennison went to
lon don to live in a poor quarter of the
east end in 1871 arnold toynbee gave several addresses before
the workingmens organizations in lon don and in the provinces
he died in 1833 while still in early manhood it
was toynbees spirit and ideas more than any work which
he individually accomplished that gave to the set tiement movement
its chief characteristics and its abiding sense of social obligation
the work eral forms 1 relief through charity and medical
attendance 2 the providing of op portuaities of a social
and recreative character 3 the establishment of educational centres for
purposes of primary or advanced instruction including certain phases of
culture in 1860 f d morris established the workingmans college
in london in 1867 cambridge uni versity started its lirst
university extension scheme following this in 1869 the charity organization
society was founded in 188s toynbee hall was opened by
bamett in east london and in 1887 the neighborhood guild
later the university settlement was opened in new york gty
these initiatory steps were followed by others of a closely
allied diaracter in all large cities wliere the density of
popula tion is simcienc to indicate the need for social
rwice the dominant idea in settlement work is diat of
teaching wageearners to help them selves the goal sought is
individual develop ment stimulated into being under the guidance of
teachers the element to be eliminated in all these efforts
is that of patronage social serv ice in the nature
of direct gifts of food fuel clothing or money must
be extended with great disc rlthi nation lest chronic pauperism
be en couraged and the already too large class of
farasites on the charitable world be increased n all phases
of the work tact and judgtnent are required but these
are particularly requisite in dealing with those cases where pride
prevents an advertisement of need or forbids the accept ance
of unsolicited help persons possessed of these qualities and who
are capable of advising and preventing the development of acute
con ditions in particular cases are of the greatest value
in settlement work nature of settlement activtiea the work at
a centre is laid out into six classes 1 care
of infants 2 courses for children from six to 14
years of age 3 course for boys and girts between
14 and is years 4 a course for women of
more than 18 years s a course for men of
18 years and upward and 6 general courses of an
advanced nature in connection with talks to mothers ocular demonstrations
of the best care of infants and young children are
given children fit for kindergarten work receive the benefit of
esthetic culture through colored paper work music songs parties games
plays etc die older children of from six to 14
through physical culture classes are given opportunities for im proving
their general health they are formed into clubs for the
purpose of developing administrative ideals and encouraging self help their
work consists of drawing sewing mending woodcarving cooking nature study
musical classes chorus work including enter tainments art exhibits siunmer
outings picnics winter socials and receptions a late develop ment
is the teaching of dancing which is found to be
a most admirable means for the development of grace of
body and the powei of acting in concert those of
18 years and upward follow a scheme which includes the
preservation of health study and training along technical lines forms
of instruction in classes lectures concerts and various aids to
culture sociability and political breadth of mind the idea running
current through all these courses designed as ihey are to
meet the requirements of the child the youth and the
adult is that of inculcating the value of physical health
wage earning and other concomitants of economic welfare general instruction
an insight into the meaning of aeslhetic culture the value
of functions which increase sociabihty the advan tages of clubs
and discussions for the jpurpose of gaining political and other
cooperation and other means of creating a sense of community
interest and good citizenship social service to the immigrant while
in the older nations the class among which these activities
are exercised is made up of natives the submerged tenth
of london for instance in america it is the newcomer
the first generation of the immigrant horde and its children
that 11 for the labor of the social service workers
and the work required is the adjustment of the lives
of these people to their new environment and especially in
giving to the older ones a sense of nationality and
citizen ship and a knowledge of the power this gives
them when they fully realize that they can if they
will choose representatives to properly present their needs an immense
gain ts made and the feeling of class against class
and a belief in dominance of wealth in the govern
ment ideas only too prevalent and not wholly without foundation
will be in a fair way of disappearing to awaken
within the immigrant a consciousness of his power is a
mor as well as an economic necessity for social de
moralization disappears before healthy mental activity the religious question is
delicate only when misunderstandings arise if the expressed object of
a centre is to impart religious or ethical principles a
frank acknowledgment is proper some settlements operate along definite de
nominational lines so that no misapprehension arise even when proselting
results ambiguity in this respect is an injury to the
cause adminibtration of settlementsa head worker is the chief of
a staff of assistants which are divided into two classes
the rsl and most important class are the resident workers
the second class are nonresident workers the headworkers duty is

cbtaining practical results but no ecort must be spared to
avoid friction and to produce an ab solute harmony in
all parts of the work far the proper administration of
activities centred in a settlement money must be forch coiring
thou the city itself is the direct bene factor it
is never the main contribuiot tlie workers must be sufficiently
well paid to enable them to live decently while devoting
their time to the work to the nonresident workers no
remtueration is given it is then a necessary part of
the work to secure money when there is not a
regular income provided by endow ment or contributions as far
as possible the idea of selfsupport is advanced in all
phases of settlement work the headworker and his assistants plan
along economic as well as cultural lines a headworker of
strong per sonality and broad mentality with experience and judgment
is necessary as supervisor and manager diplomacy is a great
requisite particularly in the encouragement of those willing to sacrifice
lime and labor for humanitys sake as resident or nonresident
workers development of the settlement idea from toynbee hall in
1s85 the settlement idea spread out through the larger centres
of population in englana until today there are about so
such in the country in america the neighborhood guild of
new york was followed soon after by the college settlement
and in 1889 chicago saw the establishment of hull house
the greatest american settlemenl in america there are at present
over 100 settle ments doing excellent work in the congested
areas of 3ie large cities the universitf populaire and the
ceuvre de popincowt in paris are similar in their educational
work to the university settlements the ouis huis of amsterdam
holland is also similar there is a missionary settlement in
bombay the house of neighborly love in kioto japan and
kingsley hall and a french missionary settle ment in toldo
the movement has spread to australia the toynbee guild at
sydney bnne founded by an oxford man in america and
to a greater extent elsewhere social settlement work can ever
be but a palliative in that the fundamental causes of
poverty low wages etc are left untouched by the movement
young college men and women of humanitarian views speaa a
few years in the work after graduation but leave it
for a real career just when their experience would render
them valuale aides in the work by some it is
used as a means to acquire the necessary experience in

americaniia tion in the united states takes up the work
of the social settlement as far as regards the preparation
of ihc foreigner within our shores or dtiienship even here
the motive has not been cntirelj altruistic nor patriotic but
rather the effect of conservatives to stave off the in

socialism is a word having two dis tinct but related
meanings primarily it is used as the name of a
certain philosophy of histcry and method of interpreting and analyzing
social phenomena in the second place since this philosophy and
method have as one of their principal conclusions that socitty
is evolving toward a cooperalive social stage the word is
used to designate a cooperative social organiza tion where the
means for the production and distribution of wealth are the
collective prop erty of the working class while the goods
which are to be consumed become the private property of
the individual workers the phi losophy of socialism as generally
accepteil by the socialist parties of the world at the
present time takes as its fundamental hypothesis what has been
variously called the materialistic in terpretation of history historic materialism
or economic determinism this doctrine is stated as follows in

urge froia all exploitatir djatinctiotib and daisrulea it is maintained
that the form in which production is carried on in
any society con stitutes the fundamental fact which determines all
other social institutions this does not hold that each economic
era begins tabula rasa in the field of institutions eiach
historical stage in herits its institutions from the previous stage
and it can influence change and reconstruct these of establish
new ones alongside of them these inherited characteristics include customs
laws ethical standards public opinion and in short the whole
set of institutions and social psychology which has been built
u throiwh out the course of human evolution the analogy
between heredity and environment in biotcwy and in the social
organism is here veiy close since the appearance of die
institution of private property in die instruments by which wealth
is produced and distributed society has necessarily been divided into
two classes ac cording as their members own or do
not own these essential for the production of wealth the
struggle of these classes for power consti tutes a large
portion of the history of modern times in the middle
ages land being the most essential instrument for the production
of wealth the landlords were the ruling class and social
institutions were determined by them in accord ance with their
interests when the great trans fonnation of hand tools into
factory machinery look place at the close of the 18ih
and beginning of the i9th century this machinery of the
modern factory became ijie most essential cle ment in the
production of wealth and its own ers became the ruling
class when the owners of industrial capital had gained their
victory they set about establishing a society in accordance with
their interests they formed at this time the class most
nece sary to the basic industrial processes of society since
the accumulation and organization of cap ital was the most
essential thin at this histori cal period later on the
capitalist class laid down its function as organizer and director
of industry and became simply a shareholtfing class hired wage
workers including manual laborers overseers bosses and superintendents perform all
the essential social processes the capitalist class having handed over
its function to the working class the latter becomes not
only the most essential but the only essential class the
material interests of this class in volve it in continuous
struggles with the capital ists sooner or later this struggle
is transferred to the political field where me laboring class
is represented by the socialist party having as its object
the capture of the powers of govern ment and social
control in order that it may use them in the
interest of that class according to this philosofjiy the social
dy namic which compels advance is the continuous improvement of
the processes of production every new invention and every improvement
in the organization of industry starts in motion a series
of influences which do not cease until they have reached
and affected every institution witnin the sodety of which they
form the indus trial basis dunng the last looyears mechanical
improvements have multiplied many fold the productive power of each
individual worker but the army of unemployed prevent the price
of labor power as a whole from rising much above
the point necessary to maintain the efficiency of the wageworker
as a producer consequently the workers who use these im
proved instruments receive but a small fraction of the greatly
multiplied product they have no choice under the present system
but to accept these conditions while production is for sale
in the competidve market only the cheapest can continue to
produce if the workers are to produce and they cannot
live without pro ducing since thev have no power of
ownership to take from other producers they must gain access
to these highly perfected tools hence they compete with one
another for the privilege of using them and of selling
their laborpowct to the owners of the toots they finally
accept a wagecontract by which for the privilege of producing
their own wages during the first hour or two of
work they continue at work tor many hours more priltducinp
surplus value for the owner of the means of production
which they improvements in production often take other than mechanical
forms tht modern trust is to some extent to be
considered as such an improvement sociaust writers pointed out over
a half century ago the self destructive character of competition
it was then foreseen that one of the inherent characteristics
of large industrv was its greater economy as compared with
smaller competitors consequently the large in dustry tended to eliminate
all smaller competi tors within the circle of its market
