of words by means of letters or alphabetic sym bols
in certain languages like spanish for instance the system of
representing the sounds of the language by alphabetic symbols is
prac d google tically perfect in other words it is
phonetic in english on the contrary the muhiplicity of vowel
sounds attd the composiie character of the language itself have
in the course of severs cenluries of growth and continuous
imilatiods made of the alphabet a curious com plex and
complicated patchwork which is the despair of foreigners who attempt
to learn the language a technically perfect alphabet should have
an alphabetic symbol o represent each sound in the language
and no symbol should represent more than one sound were
this the case all the difficulty in spelling would at
once disappear in spanish schools spelling is not taught because
of the regularity of the span ish alphabet in italian
also there is very little necessity for the teaching of
spelling for the same reason but the irregularity of the
eng lish alphabet has placed a heavy burden upon the
shoulders of elementary pupils and of foreigners learning the language
years of study and practice are necessary to acqtiire a
command of english spelling the modern english alphabet illustrates vividly
the various changes through which the english tongue has passed
since ine days when the germanic tribes first began to
overrun the british islands saxon dane northman norman french celt
and latin have con tributed to make it what it
is today by ving it vowel and consonantal sounds and
modifying those it primitively possessed when saxon and celt first
met on english soil the english alphabet has grown up
without any attention be ing paid to its development or
any effort being made to direct its development or to
shape its ends the result is that enish has acquired
a great many more alphabetic sounds than it possesses symbols
with which to represent them this in itself is bad
enou but the confusion is made all the greater by
the fact that sometimes there are two or more symbols
to represent the same sound and that quite frequently compound
letters are used to repre illustrated by presenting the different
garbs under which the sound c or i as in
cat or kit presents itself it is represented by cc
as in account cck in bacchus ck as in back
cq as in acquaint cu as in biscuit ik as
in talk chalk ike as in folkestone q as in
ueen qu as in liquor que as in barque antique
qith as in urquhart ic as in viscount ugh as
in hough and x as in excise except and finally
by three combinations of the k symbol k as in
kite ke as in burke kh as in khan making
in all 19 letters and combinations of letters to represent
the same sound as if these various modes of representing
the same simple sounds were not confusing enough some of
the combinations are used to repre sent other sojinds thus
gk in cough repre sents ch in schism is mute
while in sdiist it is sounded as ft x in
anxious has the force of ish and ks in box
in kale kaiser and words of greek origin k has
the sound usually attribtited to its name and office which
betrays its greek origin though it came into english irom
latin where it was also used almost alto gether in
the spelling of greek words such irreeularities as the foregoing
are abundant in english spelling the original cause of these
irregularities was prolific of a good crop of chants from
the original saxon forms of the enghsh tongue these were
multiplied by the constant modifications produced by these vari ous
language sources acting and reacting upon one another by the
obscuring of full sounds and by the neglecting of others
these changes seem to have been many and to have
taken place rapidly between the time of chaucer and shakespeare
the evidence of the cause of many of these changes
is still to be seen in england and the lowlands
of scotland today in the various rural dialects which sharply
dif ferentiate localities or less to the sound of the
word as this sound was frequently quite different in different
localities the at tempts lo represent it phonetically produced widely
varying results a similar result may be seen today in
the conscious attempts of certain british writers to reproduce the
low land scotch yorkshire cumberland devon shire and other dialects
and of american dialect writers to present graphically the manners
of speaking ejiglish of the negro the various foreigners in
the country the new england ohio western and southern dialects
as there is no prescribed standard for the representa tion
of these dialects so there is no uniformity of spelling
employed by the different dialect writers this condition represents well
the lack of uniformity in spelung among writers of english
previous to the introducing of spelhng ana even for some
time afterward but the multiplicity of books made possible by
the in vention 01 the printing dress the vast reduc
tion in the cost of reproduction and the conse quent
spread of the printed word from the commercial centres made
the imposition of some standard of spelling necessary unfortu nately
the imposition of this standard came at a time when
the english biwuage was still rapidly undergoing phonetic changes and
the standardized spelhng made no provision for the modification of
itself in conformity with the changes taking place the renaissance
brout into the english language many foreign words generally in
their native dress and these in troduced new sotmds and
letters and combina tions of letters thus adding to the
confusion which became gradually greater as many of these foreign
words in the mouths of the il literate were modified
in pronunciation while still preserving more or less closely their
orial spelhng in the course of time these vanous manysided
influences syllables and sounds that were pronounced at an earlier
stage of the langua became mute but still the rules
of prinbng and custom engendered by them retained them these
attempts to pro mole a certain arbitrary uniformity and ac
curacy while beneficial contributed power fully to the increase of
the confusion already existing by failing to provide for the
recogni tion of signs becoming mute and of syllables and
letters changing their phonetic value this naturally continued lo increase
the ambiguity of the phonetic values of the letters of
the alphabet and to augment the irregularities in thwr use
no longer the name or given value of a letter
d google spelling ssform and its rounds in actual use
corresponded to such an extent has this confusion been carried
that there is at present not a single ktter in
the english alphabet that does not represent two or more
soiud values the vowels beii the actual voice sounds are
the most irregular in this respect an analysis of these
sounds is most sugrestive of the confusion existing in eoelish
imonetics thug o has 10 sounds a e and u
have nine each i has eight while y has two
as a vowel and three as a consonant were these
sounds not duplicated they would represent as different vowels but
they are constantly replacing one another thus making confusion more
confounded to ihe foreigner who attempts to learn the english
language the confusion in the use of the consonants is
great one of them r has six sounds four j
i and x have five sounds each three d a
g have four each six f h i m ft
q have ttiree each and the remaininir seven have two
each the confusion in english orthography is still further increased
by the presence of 3 great number of silent letters
some of which how ever serve to determine the value
of other let ters there are but 44 sounds in
the english language yet they are represented by about 500
symbols and combinations thereof with their various applications phonetic spelling
many attempts have been made at phonetic sklling and the
more scientific of these have come pretty near per fection
the failure to achieve perfection being due in some cases
to a desire to achieve the radical over the purely
scientific and phonetic the best of these attempts have been
made by the writers of methods of shorthand one of
the earliest and most satisfactory of which was thai of
isaac pitman qv which with its derivatives is the most
widely used of short hand systems pitman furnished an alphabet
of 24 consonant and six long and six short vowel
sounds as follows consonants p b t d i i

simple symbols in the pitman alphabet the work of pitman
and of some 200 workers in the field of shorthand
together with many who have followed in his footsteps has
tended toward the simplification of english spelling to some small
degree so far as the actual re forms accomplished but
the work is really greater than it appears since the
moral tn uence and te example of success attained of
shorthand writers are already strongly thrown in the balance for

did not begin with johnson his work simply marked the
place this reform had reached aiid set up a common

really no argument against the most advanced propositions to say
we are getting away from the language of shakespeare and

the spelling of certain classes of words into a uniformity

afrmc ih writ after 1884 the subject of spelling reform
did not attract any general allenlion for more than 20
years in spite of the publication of periodicals devoted to
the propaganda and the occamonal outbreak of some enthusiastic votary
but in 1906 the estabushment of the simplified spelling board
gave the reform a vigorous thrust forward the board recommended
for adoption a list of 300 simplified spellings with which
to begin the change toward a more scientific literation of
the language this move would probably have attracted no more
notice than many of its predecessors had not presi dent
roosevelt issued an executive order in august 1906 directing the
public printer to use all these spellings in the papers
sent out by his office the congress however would not
allow these changes to be made in the papers that
came to the members from the printer and in december
the order was rescinded the rather illadvised exuberance of some
of ihe advocates of the reform has made it an
object of temporary ridicule but the probabilities are that the
really great advantages to be gained will be more and
more appreciated until the work of the reformers produces tangible
and en during results the practice of isolated in dividuals
may help but real reform comes slowly and in accordance
with reason and the laws of language the simplified board
claims that 380 institutions of higher learning and 456 newspapers

his father was a teacher a nonconform ist who was
for years a wesleyan but who afterward seceded from that
religious body and remained to the end of his life
somewhat in different to outward relieious forms although a dely
religious man the subsequent tend ency of spencers philosophy was
indirectly but in a very potent way iklennined by the
education that his father gave him during his chiidtood and
early youth it was an educa tion that decidedly tended
to quicken his inter est in the study of nature
and to develop his powers of independent thought and of
inquiry into the nature of things furthermore the non conform
st atmosphere in which spencer grew up strongly tended to
cultivate in his mind fwlitical liberalism of the type then
character istic of many of the most progressive english minds
in 1837 spencer began the study of en gineering under
mr charles fox the engineer of the london and birmingham
railway then recently constructed spencer continued his work in the
service of me railway with some interruptions until 1s4i in
1843 he went to london and engaged in contributing to
the va rious periodicals and in somewhat varied ac tivities
of a miscellaneous sort until 1850 in 1842 he wrote
a series ot letters to the nott confomtist a newspaper
then recently estab lished as an organ of the dissenters
the let ters dealt with some principles relating to the
influence of legislation upon social processes and began the train
of thought which spencer bter developed in his social statics
the social statics his first book was written be tween
1848 and 1850 and is characterised by the author himself
as a kind of natural bis tory ethics the work
especially maintains the doctrine of the right of the individual
and of the necessity for noivinterference on the part of
the government the characteristic of spencers sociological studies a this
time as contrasted with those of other english liberals who
were his contemporaries was the tendency to base the doctrine
of noninterference upon very general considerations derived from natu ral
history and from the study of natural law in general
society like tbe individual organ ism is so spencer now
teaches the result of a growth which is subject to
determinate natural conditions which in consequence tends on the whole
to results advantageous in the end to individuals white this
growth of society cannot be safely interfered with by artificial
devices a generalization of the interests whth spencer thus early
expressed led him within the next few years to a
study of the processes of growth in nature in their
more general aspects ac cepting almost as soon as he
distinctly con ceived of it at all the doctrine that
all living forms are the result of natural processes of
growth and are not due to special creation spencer was
led during the immediate follow ing years to an effort
to formulate in general terms the law of progress or
of development which he concdved to be common to all
stich processes of growth in 18s4s5 he wrote the first
edition of his principles of psychology in which he endeavored
first to characterize in a decidedly novel way the nature
and proc esses of life in general and then to
apply this general formula to the investigation of the de
velopment of mind life spencer now defines as a series
of changes occurring in an organism in such ways as
involve a continuous adjust ment of inner relations to outer
relations the mental processes are then defined as a special
accompaniment and result of the adjustment in question between 1856
and 1860 spencer despite considerable interruption through ill health published
a large number of essays in various periodicals among which
the most im portant are 1 the four papers which
were later brought together in his volume on edu cation
and 2 a number of essays tending toward the final
expression of his general formula for evolution as both bodily
and mental development had now come in spen cers mind
to be conceived as subject to uni versal and common
laws he began to consider the possibility of a system
of philosophy in which the getieral process of evolution should
be stated in terms applicable to all kinds of de
velopment the first sketch of this system ot philosophy was
outlined in 1858 and in 1860 the definitive program of
the system of synthetic philosophy was written out the first
edition of the first principles which constituted the first part
of this system was prepared between 1860 and 1862 and
was is sued to subscribers in parts the second part
of the system of synthetic philosophy namely the principles of
biology was issued between 1862 and 1867 in 186 spencer
re cast and reissued his first principles be tween 1867
and 1870 he develgted a new state ment of his
principles of psychology as modified by the further development of
his doctrine the psychology in us new form was finied
by 1872 and farmed the third part of the system
the plan of spencers system required next in order the
application of his principles to the study of sociology an

spencer had originally contemplated in 187273 at the instance of

spencer had ten making since 1867 and with the aid
of secretaries the elaborate collections of material which wer in
a series of years published under the title descriptive sodol
o after completing the first volume of the principles of
sociology spencer turned for the time to the beginning of
what was to be the last division of his system
namely ethics and published in 1879 the data of ethics
the succeeding years until the completion of spen cers system
in 1900 were principally devoted to the preparation of the
second and third volumes of the principles of sociology and
to the completion of the ethics the de scriptive sociology

a considerable number of essays of a controver sial character
relating to his system and to its critics to contribute
also to various topics of current discussion and his autobiography
publied in 1904 is still another of the evi dences
of us extraordinary productiveness the complete list of spencers works
pub lished during his lifetime in the form which they
finally assumed in so far as he regarded them as
worthy of permanent place among his productions is as follows

the principles of ethics 2 vols second essa saentific political

fifth educa tion 1vol sixth facts and comments 1 vol
seventh various fragments i vol eighth the inadequacy of natural
selection 1 vol ninth descriptive sociology the last of these
works is in the main a collection of material prepared
by spencers assistants and printed as such but under spencers
di rection in the most general outlines what is char
acteristic of the philosophy of spencer may be sketched as
follows in his theory of knowl edge spencer has many
features in common wim the classic english empiricism but this
emiriricism in his case is modified by consid erations due
lo the doctrine of evolution knowledge namely as he teaches
arises not merely throizgh the experience of the individ ual
but through the experience of the race so that in
the individual inherited inieliectual tendencies determine the recognition of certain
fundamental truths as certain and unquestion able so soon as
attention is attracted to the mat ters which these truths
express thus mathe matical certainties are based upon a idnd
of evidence which the individual finds to be abso lute
and unquestionable but whidi the expe rience of the race
has molded into their pres ent forms in consequence when
we inquire into the foundations of knowledge we meet with
certain assurances which in our individ ual cases are to
be tested by what spencer calls the universal postulate namely
the ineon crivability of the opposite that is whatever proposition
is such that the experiment of try ing to concave
its opposite to be true persist ently fails is to
be regarded as a primal neces mty and is to
be accepted as true if we ask how the human
race came to know this propo sition to be true
the answer is through the inherited effects of experience but
if we ask why the individual must accept it as
true the answer is simply because the opposite is incon
cnvable among the principles thus warranted fy the universal postulate
the principle of the persistence of force is prominent the
fundamental principles of ethics have a similar tonndation since the
ultimate source of our knowledge lies in the experience of
the race it is impos sible either by individual observation
or by means of the iidierited effects of experience to
fathom the innermost nature of the real world we can
know only die world as it appears to beings with
sxidi an organization as the pnoesa of evolution has brought
to pass in ine case of our race any effort
to transcend the im itations thus established leads into tire
rcnon of what spencer calls the unknowable yet it would
be wrong to endeavor to conceive our world as merely
a world of phenomoia or of contents of experience or
to accept any forta of idealism for the test of
the snconceivalml ity of the opposite assures us as one
of die absolute certainties that a world of genuinfl reality
transcending all our experience both exists and is unknowable to
us it is aquajtly impossible to deny or rationally to
doubt ttra reality of such a world and to attempt
any positive theory as to what its ttltimate nature is
subjective idealism denyiue that the uo knowable exists at all
is therore according to spencer quite unthinkable but every tsoi
to give a positive account of ultimate reality breaks down
by leading us to unavoidable cothgt tradictions sudi as are
involved iu attempting to conceive the world in its wholeness
as either finite or inampoite as either caused or uncanse
as either absolute or relative and so forth all such
epistemological considerations however are for spencer mere preliminafiea his principal
philosophicai interest lies on the positive side namely in the
eff6rt to reduce ta unity the uws of the knowable
world lliat is the laws which govern the phenomena of
nature such a unification depend first upon recognizing the persistence
of force a term by means of which spencer denotes
the con servation of energy as he conceives that fact
in practice however spencers term persist ence of force is
applied in more various wayi than those which are customary
in case of the usual doctrine of the conservation of
energy the persistence of force used as a principle guarantees
us against accepting miracles against conceiving anything as occurring coun
ter to strict natural law against accepting the doctrine of
special creation and so forth in brief the doctrine of
the persistence of force gives us a view of what
may be called the ana lylie unity of nature namely
a view of that character which is common to every
sort of natural process if however we turn from the
considera tion of this most universal aspect of nature to
a study of the various types of natural proc esses
which are observable when we consider large masses or series
of natural phenomena we come hereupon to the principles charactens
tic of what may be called the synthetic unity of
nature that is of that unity which appears when we
consider the entire lives of organisms or the histories of
races of living creatures or the history of planets of
solar systems or in another realm of societies these processes
which the persistence of force render possible are of two
general types they are namely either processes of evolution or
processes or dissolution evolution occurs when great ag gregations such
as have just been mentioned appear and grow and become
organized the formation of a stellar system the solidification of
a planet the gradual building up and diversi fication of
the earths crust tfie growth of d google sut speti
tzcfoi animals or of plants the life history o an
tiidividual or of a nation these are proc esses of
evolution dissolution is the reverse of any of these processes
when an aggregate is distinlegraled dissolved or otherwise de strayed
weea an oiniiation passes away or disapars we are therefore
dealing with dis lohiuon evolution is of course the more
interesting o diese two processes it possesses according to spencer
two characteristic forms primary evolution aiid secondary evolution the latter
being based upon the former but occurring in less frequent
instances although these instan ces are very highly interesting and
important ttie characteristic of the primary evolutions is that they
involve an integration of matter and a dissipation of motion
such processes occur when masses of matter cool contract and
solid ify as for instance when planets are formed the
processes of secondary evolution are ren dered possible by the
fact that some of the bodies subject to primary evolution
do not merely contract and solfdify but also pass dirough
a stage or a series of stages of their existence
in which they predominantly possess a plastic character plastic bodies
are such as are sufficiently free from a close coherence
of parts to permit of easy changfe in conse quence
of change in their environment while at the same tinie
these plastic bodies are suffi ciently coherent to retain the
traces of dis turbances which have happened to them thus
a mountain range subject to erosion not only yields in
numerous ways to the action of water and of weather
but retains in a great variety of wavs the traces
of such erosions as have oc curred in the past
instead of being swept away at once by a single
flood as a smaller mass might be again a living
organism is a plastic hody so full of internal motion
ot of storcd up energy as to be greatly and
easily disturbed by its environment while at the same time
it is so far possessed of rigidity in its structure
and in its way of respondmg to external influences that
traces of what has happened to it remain in great
variety and for a long time or even throughout the
life of the organism tke power of an organism to
adjust itself to new conditions in combination with the power
to form and retain habits constitutes the basis for all
the higher development of life ml such powers depend physically
upon the char acteristics of the plastic bodies and the
proc ess of organic evolution is altogether to be de
scribed as due to the accumulation of such sec ondary
evolution as these properties of plastic organisms make possible since
the brain it self such as any higher animal possesses
is a plastic body the result of processes of aggrega
tion and is itself on the way toward a greater
solidification such as occurs in old age while ike brain
during youth and early maturity is at once extremely sensitive
to disturbances and very apt to retain the results of
former dis fursance it fallows that the entire evolution of
the mind which so fat as the mind is know
able accompanies the development of the brain is itself to
be described in terms of the proper ties of the
plastic bodies in consequence of the fact that evolution tp
far 86 if is a process of the cijowable worjd
is thus a result of the integration of matter lt
and the dissipation of motion and in case of the
secondary evolutiops is a result of the for niation of
the plastic bodies it follows that all evolutionary processes must
possess certain common features the primary evolution otherwise called simple
evolution consist altogether of the formation of coherent aggre gates
such as result whenever bodies solidify and part with their
internal energies the secondary evolution also called coimiound includes changes
that are due to differences in the circumstances in the
different parts of the aggregate the most notable result of
these internal dilterences is a transformation of the homogeneous into
the heterogeneous wherever evolution takes place in a plastic body
such increasing differentiation is inevitable the reason being that the
traces of previous changes are retained and are made the
basis of increas ing variety as the traces of new
changes are superposed in the more conlex instances of secondary
evolution the transition from the ho mogeneous to the heterogeneous
is loi con tijiued and extremely complicated it is ex
hibited not only in the structure of an aggre gate
but in the functions which belong to this aggrte in
case the aggregate is like a living orgamsm the seat
of a great variety of ener gies the increasing complication
and differ entiation of the functions and habits of a
living organism is thus the result of the same kind
oi process as makes its appearance even in inor ganic
nature wherever the results of former changes accumulate in a
plastic body wher ever integration and increasing heterogeneity are long
continued and important they ire also structure and function which
spencer describes as due to the process called by him
segrega tion segregation is exemplified wherever the outlines of things
grow shatper wherever the like things of the natural world
tend to be grouped near together or the unlike things
to be kept apart for certain natural forces whose presence
in the world spencer exten sively illustrates are working along
with what ever tends to differentiate phenomena and are so
working as to tend to sort out or to segre
gate like and unlike things such forces are manifest in
the case o the formation ot geo logical strata through
sedimentary deposits and in the case of the grouping together
of similar organisms in societies and in large numbers of
other instances segrefjation com bines with differentiation and with integration
to characterize the whole evolutionary process as has just been
suggested spencer also applies these principles to explain the laws
o social structure and function and to describe the evolution
of society and his especial inter est in all these
considerations lies in ois attempt ing to make clear the
unity of the evolutionary processes whether organic or inorganic the
application of the evolutionary formula to the study of psychology
has already been in general indicated mental functions grow in
a way that is igtreciscly parallel to the growth of
certain organic strnclures and functions con sequently integration dittereniiation and
segre gation can be traced in mental life as well
as m organic life and in so far as the
conditions pf intaj life are knoirable at all thesp eon
dy google ditions have to x defined in the tenns
of the same evolutionary coimula which apply to plas tic
bodies in general that is to their structure and to
their functions in order to apply these considerations to that
study of ethical problems which so early interested hita and
to the de fense of those social doctrines which he
30 early emphasized spencer laid especial stress upon naturalism in
ethics that is upon the necessi of consulting the natural
conditions of organic life in order to define the norms
of conduct conduct is an evolutionary phenom enon and is
tobe considered in the light of the general formula for
evolution conduct for instance is a part of the adjustment
of the organism to its environment and is to be
judged in the light of the lavs of that adjust
ment that condtict which secures the most perfect adjustment is
at once the most accept able to society and by
virtue of the conditions under which mind has developed is
in the long run most satisfactory to the individual con
cerned for in case of the human organism the adjustment
of internal to external con ditions normally occurs in society
hence such adjustment as keeps the individual in harmony with
his social order is conduct of the type favored by
evolution tlie inherited effects of experience appear in those of
our instincts which fit us for harmonious social life on
the other hand social harmony does not mean social subordination
the goal of social de velopment is a condition of
equilibriam in which the individual is as little interfered with
by his society as passible in so far namely as
interference would involve coercion or re straint meanwhile as this
goal is approached the individual grows increasingly differentiated in his
social functions better adapted to a wider and wider range
of social conditions and more definite in his functions notable
in spencers work has been his at titude toward the
problems of past and of con temporaneous religions the religions
of the world are the results of evolutionary processes whose
knowable aspect spencer elaborately dis cusses in his sociology viewed
as to their contents they have always included efforts to
transcend the bounds of human experience in a word to
transcend the knowable but in recognizing the existence of an
unknowable the synthetic philosophy as spencer maintains has itself in
a measure justified one of the deepest religious interests namely
the interest of findiok ourselves in some sort of relation
to a power which inscruiable diough il may be is
still everpresent and is the source of all in his
essays on education spencer has made prominent the importance of
the study of natural science and has emphasized the sig
nificance of the sort of training which he him self
originally received from his father in stun spencer was one
of the leaders of the age in which the modem
doctrine of evolu tion came into prominence in his own
devel opment be was until 1s60 when he first be
came acquainted with darwin substantially independent of other evolutionary thinkers
at least among his contemporaries indirectly and somewhat unconsciously he
was influ enced as prof john dewey has pointed out
by the tradition of 18th cenoiry frmch losophy consciously he
was molded by the english liberalism of his time and
less promi nently he was affected by the kantian cpis
temoloky with its umitation of human knowl edge to the
phenomenal world the kantian insuence was indirect occurring through spencers
reading of hamilton and of mansel spencers popular influence has
been very large still larger in america than in england
his most notable undertaking is the effort to formulate the
doctrine of evolution in gen eral terms as a part
of the undertaking his work in psychology in sociology and
to a less degree in educational theory and in ethics

was driven from his chair of divinity in 1570 the
young master of arts probably did not seek a fellowship
had he failed his friend harvey was not the man
to have kept silence more poet than scholar spenser doubtless
like other needy elizabethan poets looked lo place and patron
and became first it would sen tutor or secretaiy in
the family of a lady oi rank in the nonb
partes of england and was then upwards of a year
later called by harvey to kent for his more preferment
this gentlewoman of no meaue house in the north partes

disloyal cruelty by pretty dear intimation that his passion had

there seems unlikely an ambi tious youth would hardly seek
preferment among small farmers in a remote rural comer of
eng land the asserted lancashire setting and dialect of the
shepheards calendar are uncritical myths setting and language are not
local but literary and composite artificial rustic doric and conventional
arcadian moreover there is aubreys statement on the asserted authority
of john dryden that rosalinde was a kins woman of
sir erasmus drydens wife who was a daughter of william
wilkes of hodnell warwickshire a place not far from the

of renaissance italy and france but immeriio justifies his editors
title of the new poet in a larger sense he
appears in the calendar like ivs master du bellay in
the deffence et illustratioa de la laneue fran coyse as
the spokesman of a school of greville and areopagus pleiade
to promulgate in ets of du bellas and ron iulmstrie
by art into a really poetic diction inversely to wordsworths
contention the new poets method is to be assimilative imita
tion of the classics primarily btit with a judi cious
eye to the best among modem and na tional models
spensers own pronouncement the english poete was not printed sidney
may have worked it into his own defense of poesie
the platonist doctrine of which con curs with spensers the
question of classical metres was discussed by the areopagus as
it had been by the pleiade but the harvey spcuser
correspondence has exaggerated its im portance for the english school
spenser aspired early to be the english virgil the poeta
novus of his own day iind in 1579 had already
begun the epic designed to follow his lowflying pastoral as
the jeneid followed the bucolica such indeed was as e
k says the common aspiration of renaissance poets du bellay
eloquently de manded for france a long poeme worthy to
stand with the matid and the orlando furioso for the
renaissance however virgil was more than the poetic historian of
the founditig of rome the romanus ver gilius of petronius
he was also the moral allegorist of macrobius and petrarch
and the unwitting christian prophet of dante spensers first idea
was apparently to reexpress these patriotic moral and religious he
sent harvey a draft of his resulting faerie queene bui
harvey was unconvinced by this attempt to overgo ariosto and
spenser worked away ia silence for 10 years of the
faerie queene of 1590 harvey was loud in praise and
in fairness we may presume a radical recasting until lord
greys retirement august 1582 spenser was his secretary by march
1581 he had also purchased from ludowick bryskett ap pointment
with rit of deputy as registrar or clerk of the
faculties of the court of chancery in dublin he began
too a series of land speculation first buying to sell
immediately abbey enniscorthy in county wexford and an abbey in
new ross next january 1582 he leased for six years
the dublin residence of the attainted lord baltinlass and secured
a cus todian of mewlands m fcildare property of a
relative of baltinglass on august 24 he leased for ku
a year the dissolved house of friars minor of the
new abbey in the county of kil dare with its
possessions and resided there at least during 158384 when he
served as a commissioner of musters for the county in
is90 his lease of new abbey was forfeited for nonpayment
of renl the dublin house be used for business convenience
the conversa tions described in brysketls discourse of civill life
took place probably in the spring of 1584 or 1585
and spenser came daily from neighboring dublin to join in
them finally his name appears in the articles june 1586
for the munsler undertakers or coloniiers as lessee of the
castle and lands 3028 acres oc kilcolman in county cork
although the pat ent was not passed until 36 oct
1591 spenser must have taken possession by 1588b9 since in
that year he reported six english settlers on the estate
and also received raleigh as guest rent was fixed at
is i3j 4d per annum to be doubled after michaelmas
1594 there is record of payihent for 1592 on removal
to kiicolman he resigned 22 june 1s88 the dublin clerkship
to purchase again from bryskett clerkship of the govern ment
council of munsler brytt however apparently reserving a share in
the reversion of the office spenser like his master chaucer
was a shrewd man of business but ms shrewd ness
had lis nemesis local feeling ran high against the undertakers
on 12 oct 1589 lord roche of ferraoy englishborn but
irish by sympathies charged spenser with unlawful dis possession of
certain lands by colour of his office and by making
of corrupt bargains with certain persons pretending falselie title this
began a series of pet persecutions by rochf google none
of his people should have any trade conference with mr
spenser or mr piers or any of their tenants being
english another time by fineii a tenant of his own
for that he received mr spenser in his house as
he came from the session at limerick probably for protest
against roche as well as on raleighs invitation spenser left
for london between october 12 when roche brought suit and
december 1 when the first three books of the faerie
qneenegt were entered since 10 years before spenser had boasted
of overgoing arioslo he had grown in knowl edge and
experience biyskett draws him less poet than philosopher even in
1579 no two literary temperaments could have been more antipathetic
than the platonizing puritan of cambridge and london and the
horatianly cynical witty ferrarese after 1580 the or lando furioso
remained for spenser a store house of plot and incident
and character in silhouette cf r e n dodse publ

arthurs mystic love for the dreamedof glorianathe faith whence all

romance is raised to a power for righteousness by the
neoplatonisra to which as applied to womanly influence castiglione following
bembo gave international vogue harmonimtion of neopiatonism with cath olic
theology had been a commonplace since ficino not to say
origen spenser s idea was to hartnoniie neoplalonism with puritan
theology his method can be seen in the fowre hymnes
the first pair composed in the greener limes of his
youth superbly voice a nearly pure neoplatonism of the type
of benivieni the second pair 1596 somewhat mechanically transpose uie

already adumbrated in ityndales prologue upon the epistle of saint
paul to the romans republished in works 1s73 spensers problem
was to express this eclec tic system through a romanic
narrative itself constructed from many sources classic me dixval renaissance
the personages of which should represent its categories and their
or dered adventures its dialectic and at the same time
also to shadow forth as through a double veil the
religious political and contem graty social history of england no
other uropean poet except dante had essayed so prodigious a
task and spenser may have been emulating dante but the
english poet was infinitely less happy in his medium die
cloudily shifting scenes monotonous illmotivated ex ploits vaguely or externally
differentiated characters of popular chivalric fiction offered but a poor
substitute for the tuscans accu rately symbolic yet localizable and
tangible other world of nicely discriminated himian realities the curiously
protean poem however even in its weakness was nicety calculated
to con temporary taste it had something for all high
if vague doctrine for thinkers classical learning and italianate elegance
for scholar and dilettante romantic story graphic picture piquant gossip
for courtier or fine lady and the cultivated elizabethan often
united m himself all these moods spenser was at once

have been taken by some as by jonson to the
artificially archaic diction at tempt on pleiadiste principles to dam
up current speech at its chaucerian well of english un

probably disappointed however for another reason on his own testimony
especially f q vi xii 41 and that of contemporaries

strata of transparent cells connected by holes which are capable
of absorbing and retaining much water this ability to retain

in strument for recording the movements of the pulse the
first true sphygmograjih was the invention of vierordt and has
received various improvements in its most improved form it consists
of a small rod which moves vertically up and down
and in so doing communicates motion to a thread passing
round two horiion tal movable axes one of which moves
a needle that serves as an index while the other
moves a wheel a pen held in a jointed stalk
fol lows the movements of this wheel and records its
motions on a strip of paper which is passed beneath
it by clockwork the record has the appearance of a
more or loss irregularly un dulaling line at the lower
end of the vertical rod is a small plate rounded
on the lower sur face and when the instrument is
in use this ilate is brought into contact with the
skin above the pulse which is kept in position by
a rest tupporting the wrist before the instrument is set
in full operation the position of the pulse is slightly
varied until it is ascertained in what position it gives
the strongest impulse to the vertical rod which is indicated
by the index needle on a graduated scale obviously any
other form of recording inetrument that measures the pulsebeats may
bear the name and some have been invented but if
the test be made directly of the heart action the
name is scarcely appropriate one of these latter is the

take their prey by means of snares upon or near
which they habitually slay they thus have the distinction almost

a livelihood by use of manufactured im filements the wandering

some species of spider may not be found the problem
of commissary supplies for this in numerable army is an
important one and its factors in the danger consideration opens
up a strange contradictory phase of human nature or pernaps
one should say of human ignorance the popular prejudice against
spiders has been so long fixed that it is hard
to overcome it but is yielding before the better icnowledge
of natural objects and sympathy therewith that now prevail the
prejudice is perhaps largely due to erroneous views of their
ughness and dangerousness the species frequenting cellars and outhouses are
dark colored and at first glance somewhat ungainly but id
judge the race by these would lead one as far
astray as to judge all birds by buziards and crows
in truth some slider species rival butter hies and beetles
in brilliancy of color and these are not tropical forms
alone but are among our indig enous species and may
be found in most parts of america by searching fields

qtotic species are even more brilliant yet more erroneous is
the popular view of the spiders noxious and injurious character
that a few species may and occasiotiall do in flict
a wound that may cause suflenng and under peculiar conditions
even death is doubt less true although it is nearly
impossible to verify current renorts of injury and death caused
by a socalled black spider which as it commonly turns
out had simply been seen somewhere near the victim that
insects inflict wounds which ma be serious under certain unfavorable
conditions is well known and the possibilities for great damage
to the human familv by flies and mosquitoes is now
estab lished but spiders may be ranked among the least
dangerous to man of the small and most familiar invertebrates

welldrained loamy soils and always fives best returns when abundant
nitrogenous ood isreadily available it is easy of cultiva tion
the seed may be sown in early autumn in the
north and covered during the winter with loose straw or
marsh hay free from weed seeds in spring the mulch
should be removed very early eany spring sowing may be
done but since the plants produce smaller fewer and poorer
leaves and are prone to develop a seed stalk at
the approach of warm weather the planting season in spring
must be curtailed about eight weeks usually elapse between sow
ing and gathering the plants except when the crop is
wintered in field practice spinach is usually sown in beds
about 10 feet wide made by plowing several furrows toward
a centre and leaving dead furrows between die beds for
surface drainage the seeds are sown in drills about 15
inches apart and the ground kept cleanly cultivated since the
crop is of short duration it is generally used prior
to or after summermaturing crops it is however also frequently
sown between the rows of other crops immense quantities of

spinal cord the posterior or inferior portion of the cerebrospinal

which stand upright it may be termed the lower portion

into a series of lerminal nerves the soralleid cauda equina

in different animals see amatouy cohpaxattve in man how ever
the spinal cord comprises all that portion which lies between
the cauda equina and the decussation of the pyramids in
the medulla ll lies within the bony framework of the
spine rovered on the outside by a thick membrane the
dura mater which is txmtinuous with the dura mater of
the brain within this is a thin delicate layer of
tissue the pis matei which covers the cord closely being
continuous with the pia mater of the brain between the
dura and pia a certain amount of cerebrospinal fluid is
found which serves as a protection sheath passing out and
coming into the cord are the paired motor and sensory
nerves that carry motor impulses to all the muscles of
the body below the head and sentoiy impulses to the
brain from all the sense organs of the skin mucous
membranes and viscera in simple langiiage it is a targe
cable which carries in coming and outgoing messages the incoming
messages come inrough various organs of sense the stimuli come
in through receptors they then travel in nerve fibres enter
the cord form connections etc with the brain or other
nervous centrals and outgoing messages travel down to make effective
action in the environ ment the general shape of the
spinal cord is cylindrical it is slightly flattened front and
fnck and tapers at its caudal end into a long
thin strip die filum terminale in its course it shows
two enlargements the cervical and dorsal enlargements corresponding to the
loca tion of increased amounts of nervous tissue that go
and come from the upper and lower extremities the length
of the cord proper apart from its terminal alament averages
only about 18 inches it therefore falls short several inches
of filling the entire spinal canal it is about onehalf
inch in width at the widest pah and weighs in
an averje adult about one pound the spinal cord is
nothing but a collec tion of nerve ganglia and nervefibres
but in the human cord these are not as simple
in their arrangement as in the nervous cords of insects
for instance the cord preserves its bilateral symmetry but its
metameric symtnetry is much modified particularly in its internal structnre
thus the spinal cord consists of nervecells and nervefibres like
all other parts of the nervous system it is divided
almost into two halves by deep fissures in front and
behind and there are several secondary fissuresthat further sub divide
the cord into seijments corresponding somewhat to its anatomical arrangement
in order to understand somewhat of this ana tomical arrangement
it is important first to trace the different fibreiracts that
go up and down the spinal cord and which make
up its while matter the first nervefibres to develop are
sensory these collect into bundles and through the posterior spinous
processes pass into the cord and constitute two bundles of
fibres the columns of gall and the columns of burdach
these columns are at first very small but as they
continue to recmve more and tremelv complicated anatomical with the
different segments of die cord one set of these collaterals
however makes a dis tinct bundle of fibres which has
been called the column of gowers or ascending lateral tract
all three of these fibretracts carry sensory impressions from the
surface of the body to the brain they constitute the
sensory neuron paths the column of gowers is known to
carry painsensorj stimuli these sensory neuronpaths terminate in the sensory
areas qv in the brain having numerous interrup four of
these stations the first ganglionic centre is in the posterior
ganglia the second is in the medulla constituting the nuclei
of the columns of gall and burdach the third is
in the opuc thalamus and the fourth is in the
cortex of the brain as to the part of the
cortex it varies according to the character of the incoming
stimuli gravity stimuli are mostly located in the cerebellum sit
stimuli in the occiirital lobes sound stimuh in the temporal
lobes where the sensations for liver spleen kidney heart etc
are is still under discussion passing down from the brain
a large number of motor tracts make up the larger
part of the re maining white matter of the cord
the most important of these bundles are the direct and
indirect or crossed pyramidal tracts the de scending anterolateral tract
and direct cere bellar tract are other smaller fibremasses still
other minute fibrebundles are found in the cord but their
description belongs to more extensive treatises the main function of
these descending tracts is to carry motor im pulses down
from the motor area to the gray masses of nuclei
located on the interior of the sjnnal cord from these
spinal centres the im pulses are transmitted to the motor
nerves which pass out the entire length of the cord
from in front where they later bend backward and join
the sensory fibres and together form mixed nervetrunks the motor
nerves finally terminate in the muscles by specially modified muscle
plates as the nuclei of the columns of gall and
burdach in the medulla were the first ganglionic terminals of
the sensory neuron chains so the gray masses in the
anterior columns of the cord are the first ganglionic terminals
of the motor neuronchain if the spinal cord be cut
across these ganglionic masses appear on the cut surface as
a gray letter h or as a butterfly wing according
to the region where the cut is made in these
wings certain definite groups of ganglioncells may be made out
running short distances in and down the spine these constitute
definite ganglionic centres for certain muscle groups and their destruction
causes the wellknown spinal paralysis of children throughout the entire
length of the spinal cord there is a small cavity
around which there are bridges of fibres connecting the two
halves of the cord thus the spinal cord is seen
to represent a mass of cells and fibres of vastly
complicated structure and subservinf all of the nervous functions of
the muscles of the skeleton and of the viscera below
the diaphragm save the stomach the d google 418 spinal
cord surgkby spindlbtrbb spinal cord is in intimate connection through
out its entire length with the sympathetic nervous system any
inierrupiion in the spinal cord interferes with the carrying capacity
of its fibres and cells there then results disease of
the spinal cord the symptoms of which will differ according
to the place where the inter ruption takes place agt
the pathways of the dinerent kinds of jensatkm messages and
mo tion messages are extremely complex they can not all
be spoken of here only some of the more striking
types of toss will be spoken of if the entire
cord is cut across as happois in broken back from
diving into shallow water from bullet wminds of war or
sometimes from a tumor of the spinal cord or an
inflammation there results a paralysis of all motion below the
place where the injary takes place if in the upper
neck region the paralysis is of the entire body below
the neck if the mjiiry is lower down the lower
extremities alone are invotred with such portions of the trunk
as lie bdow the site of the injury all above
the site of the lesion is a loss of sensation
this would rally folknv frcn what has been said that
the pathways are carrying sensory messages up and motor messages
down an incomplete section of the spinal cord introduces a
number of complicated results which only the nervous specialist can
analyze he is like a telephone expert he is a
trouble hunter on the line and from the symptoms which
the patient shows he is able to accurately locate the
place where the interruptions are occurring or have oc in
some disease processes localiied parts of the stmttal cord are
flicked out by the process and a limited type of
iniury takes place thns in the disease known as b
fan tile paralysis poiiomyeliti the virus of the disease chiefly
involves the connections of the motor pathways as they make
a switchboard connection with the masde giltoups in ijie anterior
horns of the spinal oord this results in a partial
or com plete parab of one or more groups of
muscles sometimes the sensory parts of the cord are cut
ofe or diseased this cuts off in formation from switchboard
operators higher up and various ts of loss of feeling
in ability to localize mobility to know what one is
doingwitb ones muscles etc results a great number of complicated
troubles can result and bring about the clinical pictures called

united states was the most fa miliar autograja in the
country spinning the process of twisting into fine threads of
uniform size fibres of cotton flax woo or other fibres
for weaving iur poses the process was performed by hand
from early egyptian times with the distaff and spindle the
distaff being a stick or staff on which a mass
of carded raw material called a loving was loosely bound
and the spindle being 3 smaller round stick usually weighted
to which the thread was attached and with which it
was twirled into a thread or yam by adroit manipulation
the art of spinning thus came to include two distinct
operations the draw ing out and evening the fibre which
was to form the thread and the twisting of it
in handweaving the first was done by the fingers of
the left hand the second by the right hand the
spinningwheel lo revolve the spindle attached to its frame was
an improvement on the manual method introduced from india into
eurofte during the 14th century and thence to america in
ihe 17ih century its use did not the 19th century
in many provincial places un touched by railways throughout europe
and other parts of the worlh the operation usually performed
by young women gave rise among enishspeaking people to the
word spinster the india wheel was comparatively large and the
operator stood at her work walking away and back as
the forming of the thread seemed to requre a woolspinner
working continuously would thus travel 20 miles a day the
next development was the saxony wheel or flax wheel invented
in nurembu about 1530 this wheel was much smaller in
diam eter and operated by a treadle the spinner sit
ting at her work the drivingcord of the saxonv wheel
was in two loops one passing around the pulley of
the spindle and the other around the pum of a
bobbin or reel on which the yarn was wound as
it was spim later two spindles were in use on
the saxony wheel by expert spinners who thus doubled the
usuj amount of thread in a given time with the
improvement of the loom so that its output was quadrupled
the demand for yarns was sud ily increased beyond the
capacity of the hand iners invention was thus stimulated and
in 38 two spinners john wyatl and lewis paul devised
and patented a method of drawing out and evening the
fibre preparatory lo twisting by means of rollers revolving upon
one another ror some unexplained reason this mechanism failed to
come into popular use in the spinning trade until 30
years later when the idea was adopted by ricliard arkwright
and embodied in his throstle machine in quick succession at
the beginning of the last third of the 18th cen
tury appeared hargreaves spinning jenny an improvement on the doublethread
producing saxon wheel arkwrights throstle machine or rolldrawing spinning machine
and cromp tons mulespinner three inventions which revo lutionized the
art of spinning although many important improvements have been made
since in constructive details the general priciples of all modem
spinning machinery are those of these three inventions the sinnine
jenny invented by james har greaves in 176 in its
simplest form resembled a number of spindles turned by a
common wheel or drum which was worked by hand it
stretxed out the threads as in common spin ning of
carded cotton eight at a time but thn was soon
improved upon and with the applica tion of power as
many as 80 could be spun as easily the drawing
was done by a movable carnage on a track which
simulated the move ment of the walking spinner at the
india wheel the throstle or rolldrawing spinning ma chine patented
by arkwrit in l7w accom plished its object the drawing
of the rovings through the action of successive pairs of
roll ers each pair in advance of the others and
moving at different rates of speed ttie first pair to
receive the sliver compressed it and passed it to the
second pair which revolved at a greater speed and thus
pulled it out to ex actly the number of times
greater length that their revolutions exceeded those of the other
pair as the roving issued throtigh the last rollers of
each machine it was received on spools or reels calculated
to hold a given quan tity and these were transferred
to the spin ningframes which resembled the roving frames as
the roving unwound from at google but his conception is
very different from the or dinary theological one in the
first place the world is not regarded as dependent on
the will of god but as the necessary result of
his nature or essence everything necessarily fol lows from the
nature of god just as the prop erties of the
triangle orcircle follow from the nature of these figures the
bond which necessarily unites all of the parts of the
uni verse to the common centre or substance and thus
to each other is not causal in the usual sense
of that relation but rather logical god is the underlying
ground from whose nature or essence all things proceed in
a regular and uniform order god does not act as
a man acts by setting plans or purposes before him
self and then proceeding to realize them nor lias he
emotions or passions like men which move him now in
this direction and now in that spinoza satirizes unsparingly the
ex ternal teleology and anthropomorphism of his day which sought
to explain the course of natural events by referrmg them
lo special ends and purposes on the part of god
for spinoza goa is not transcendent existing apart from nature
but nature itself as an active self determining process nalura
natu rans is god the one infinite substance or god
has an infinite number of attributes but it is known
to us solely through the two attri butes of extension
and thought thus every physical thing is a mode of
extension and every idea a mode of the attribute of
thought the physical and the psychical are not inde pendent
substances as descartes supposed nor is there any interaction between
them the truth is that physical things and thoughts are
modes which express the nature of the one sub stance
but each side expresses this nature in terms of a
different attribute yet though there is no interaction there is
an exact cor respondence between the modes of extension and
the modes of thought the order and connection of ideas
is the same as the order and connection of things
this is spinozas statement of the parallelism qv of mind
and body a doctrine which he was the first to
maintain he develops this theory in some de tail defining
the mmd as the idea of the body and emphasizing
the correlation be tween the perfection and development of the
body and the effectiveness and sanity of the it is
with the problem of mans place in nature his ration
to god or the total sys tem of things and
the possibility of his free dom that spinoza is most
directly con cerned here he shows that the possibility of
mans freedom depends upon his first recog nizing that he
is a part of nature and that his mind like
everything else is subject to uni form natural laws man
forms no kingdom within a idngdom it is not contingency
or some strange power of free will which governs his
mental experiences but here as elsewhere all takes place according
to law and necessity natures laws and ordinances whereby all
things come to pass and change from one form to
another are everywhere and always the same there should therefore
be one and the same method of understanding the nature
of all things whatsoever viz through natures univeisal laws and
rules accordingly be i02a 417 proceeds i shall consider human
actions and desires in exactly the same manner as though
i were concerned with lines planes and solids from this
standpoint he gives a scientific ac count of the origin
and nature of the eitmtions showing how they necessarily arise
from certain assignable causes and how their intensity de pends
on definite natural conditions the various emotions are all found
to be com pounds of the primary stales pleasure pain
and desire bat this reductiion of the emo tions to
law is only a preliminary step in spinozas treatment to
attain freedom it is first necessary to recognize the bondage
of man the fixed determination of the emotions through natural
laws but just as knowledge is power in regard to
external nature so we can free ourselves from the emotions
by under standing their laws the mind is after all
something more than a series of passive stales its essence
consists in an effort to preserve its own being to
promote its own good and in carrying out this purpose
it finds that nothing is so serviceable as lowledge through
knowledge it is possible to free man from the bondage
of the emotions an emotion when understood becomes transformed and
ceases to be a mere state of passivity moreover when
the conditions of an emotion are understood it is possible
to arrange and assodate the various emotions in such a
way as to strengthen and promote the occurrence of those
that are desir able and to weaken and repress those
which are hurtful the highest kind of knowledge for sjunoza
is not scientific reason but intu ition the direct insight
that all things follow necessarily from the nature of god
and hence form one system to see all things not
as a series of events in time but in their
necessary logical relation to god is what spinoza calls viewing
the world under the form of eternity mb specie erterhttalis
and this highest knowledge gives rise to the intellectual love
to ward god amor intellectualis which is the highest good
or blessedness for man it is through the strength of
this emotion which is not a passion but the highest
activity of mind that the other emotions are mose successfully
governed and transformed this intellectual love toward god enables the
mind to renounce entirely all finite or personal desires as
well as all envy and jealousy he that loves god
does not demand that god should love him in return
he demands nothing for himself but acquiesces completely in the
order of the uni verse moreover spinoza argues that since
this knowledge and the intellectual love to which it gives
rise are eternal the mind which experiences these must have
something in it which is eternal and which cannot be
destroyed with the body scholars however maintain that it is
still doubtful whether spmoza pro nounces in favor of individual
immortality an interesting feature of spinozas philosopb is the close
relation which he always recinizes between the individual and society
it is no merely individual good for which he was
seek ing but one which as many others as possible
might share with him in numerous passages he approached very
near to the modern con ception of the individual as
standing in an organic relation to society for about a
century after spinozas death d google spiracles spires lessin was
the first thinker who knew and appreciated spinoza and a
controversy after his death between mendelssohn and jacobi as to
lessings real opinions did much to spread a knowledge of
the system in germany goethe was deeply influenced by spinoza
and helped to awaken interest in the spinozistic philosophy thus

tech spirit of laws the lesprit des lois montesguieu says
professor gid dings converted social philosophy into de scriptive social
science an erninent modem sociologist thus concisely summarizes the fun
damental contribution of one of the most prom inent participants
in that general intellectual movement which brought about the transforma
tion of social philosophy into the modem science of sociology
the work which right fully entitled montesquieu to this important
distinction was the spirit of laws which appeared in 1748
the spirit of laws has traditionally heen regarded as primarily
if not entirely a contribution to the literature of political
theory and more specifically as the work which gave the
doarine of the separation of power its vital impulse and
made it both a persistent dogma in political science and
a leading prin ciple in modem constitutions viewed in its
broadest aspects however this major work of montesquieu was more
than the instrument for the promulgation of a single dogma
in polflical theory it was even more than an extensive
treatise on general political theory it was in fact a
most significanl and influential contribu tion to the literature and
methodology of gen eral social science the spirit of laws
was differentiated from the contemporary works oa political theory not
only by the profundity and scope of its inquiry but
also through the method by which it approached the problem
of the analysis of the chief factors in social and
political organizations it was the first great inductive and objective
analysis of social and political processes since aristotles politics written
some 2000 years before there had heen plenty of semidescriptive
materia in the works of earlier and conteraporaiy writers but
this had been mainly concerned with scenes and episodes from
biblical and classical mythology and history in whiph the presentation
of the exploits of nimrod selh and enoch and the
heroes of homer and livy had been much tdore conspicuous
than an analysis of contem porary societies montesquieu reflected the
in fluence of the geographic discoveries of the two previous
centuries by virtue of the fact that he turned his
attention to the many and varied types of existing societies
and sought his men of nature among living savages rather
than among the mythical personages who had ex hibited their
characteristics in the period before the fall of man the
spirit of laws then was as truly the ooint of
departure for modern descriptive sociology as was humes treatise of
human nature for psychological sociology by emphasizing the fact that
wide observation must precede generalization he gave a practi cal
application in social science to the general methodological principles which
had been ad vanced in natural science by francis bacon
this constitutes the enduring contribution of montesuieu to the history
of social science and political theory and it will remain
unim paired lone after his specific doctrines have decortie obsolete
and foirotlen such is the general significance of the work
of montesquieu as set forth in the spirit of laws
his specific contributions may now be summarized among the more
important of these was his conception of the origin and
nature of law comte in describing the signifi cance of
the spirit of iws said on this point the great
strength of this memorable work appears to me to lie
in its tendency to regard political phenomena as subject to
in variable laws like all other phenomena mon tesquieus definition
of law as the necessary relations springing out of the
nature of things was truly epochmaking being in all probabil
ity the first correct statement of what is now generally
accepted as an accurate definition of a sociological law from
the different types of relationships there proceeded the various types
of laws as for example political law grows out of
the relations of the governed and gov erning in any
political community and civil law out of the everyday relations
between the individual citizens in the community laws springing thus
out of basic relationships must be related to the parliqilar
circumstances of a even society and its environing conditions iws
are therefore natural and beneficial just in propordon as this
perfect adaptability between a law and its social environment is
attained finally all types of laws are closely inter related
and should be consistent in their totality the highest achievement
of human intelligence is to secure this consistency of all
ofpes of laws and to prevent the encroachment of any
type upon the domain of another the entirety of these
relationps of social groups ana in dividuals ving rise to
human laws of laws to the social and physical environment
and of the different tes of laws to each other
con stitutes the spirit of laws and montesquieus main task
was to trace in somr detail the nature and results
of these relationships foltowinff the general premises laid dowq above
another highly significant prcmtsition advanced by montesquieu in which he
wab thoroughly in accord with modem social theory was that
in which he relinquished the contem porary absolutism regarding social
and polidcal organization and maintained the then novel doctrine of
the relativity of the excellence of mstitutions the excellence and
eifectiveness of laws and of social and political institutions hi
hegtd to be dependent not upon any intrinsic superiority but
upon their specific adaptability to the particular social environment in
which they are found or in which they may be
in tended for application now the social en vironment according
to montesquieu is essen tially determined by the historical conditions
of the development of the particular society and by the
surrounding physical environment in accordance with this type of reasoning
he endeavored to discover ana indicate the relative excellence of
the different forms of law politi cal organization and social
institutions among the diverse peoples of the earth according to
their relation to the various conditions of the physical environment
and the resulting national of social and political phenomena and
he pre sented what was by far the most complete
and accurate interpretation of social processes and political institutions in
terms of environmental d google 480 spikit levsl sntttlt plant
influences that had been developed by any traits and customs
this led him into the most comprehensive inductive and descriptive
study writer his treatment of the significance of climatic conditions
upon manldnd was especially exhaustive and has had a wide
influence but while montesquieus studies along this line gave an
added impetus to the development of that school of environmentalists
which has been most notably represented by ritter buckle raizel
semple and huntington his theories were by no means original
as ijedieu has re cently shown in a most convincing
manner montesquieu took over his environmental theories bodily from the
english physician arbuthnots essays on the enects of air on
human bodies and drew his descriptive ma terial almost wholly
from chardins travels while montesquieu has received the respect ful
attention of sociological writers chiefly on account of his emphasis
upon the element of descriptive analysis and his environmental theories
his past reputation and his present notoriety amon political theorists
has been founded upon his famous doctrine of the sep
aration of governmental powers as the chief safeguard of political
liberty this theory ain was not original as it was
taken almost directly from lockes differentiation of the powers of
government into the legislative executive and federative branches but mon
tesquieu brought his analysis more into har mony with modem
political terminology and his treatment was so vigorous and elaborate
that the doctrine has become inseparably con nected with his
name accepting this tripartite division of governmental powers as a
logical and fundamental necessity montesquieu argued diat each function must
be exerdsed by a sep arate and independent organ if
any guarantee of political liberty was to be secured the
cit izens this famous doctrine was deeply ab sorbed w
the framers of the constitution of the united states and
it was given a more impor tant place in that
document than any other single dogma of political science famous
and influential as this theory may have been how ever
it is now generally recognized to be his torically inaccurate
and practically unworkable stitution while in reality by 1748 the
totality of governmental powers in england had be come absorbed
by the single branch of the parliament and the cabinet
viewed as a com mittee of the parhament not only
was it thus in its origin and derivation the result
of a misinterpretation but as professors ford goodnow and powell
have so clearly pointed out it has proved unworkable in
practice and most of the advances which the united states
has made in effective national administration since 1787 been effected
bv gradually break ing away from the practical application of
the doctrine of the separation and independence of governmental powers
one more specific contribution made through the spirit of laws
should be mentioned and that is the calm and judicious
criticism of the cruel barbarous and irrational criminal proce dure
of the lime and the moderate and en lightened suggestions
offered as to the methods whereby it could be reformed
it was from tht treatment of this subject in the
persian let ters and the spirit of laws that beccaria
received bis inspiration for his epochmaking work on crimes and
punishments in at tempting by way of summary to differentiate
the elements of permanent value in montes quieus work from
what is transitory or al ready antiquated or discredited it
seems safe to hold that he will be accorded a
permanent and honorable place in the history of the de
velopment of social science and political theory on account of
the vigor and priority of his insistence upon the doctrine
of the relativity of the excellence of institutions according to
their adaptility to the characteristics of a given population and
upon the proposition that sociological and political generalizations mutt proceed
from a wide observation of concrete facts and conditions and
not from a priori as sumptions of the deductive philosopher
these will ensure him the respectful consideration of the student
of the history of social science long after his unfortunate
insistence upon the doctrine of the separation of governmental powers
has been forgiven if not forgotten the standard edition of
montesquieus works is has acquired something of the reputation of
a classic the best analyas of the doctrines of montesquieu

near 2000 churdies or assemblies in america then came a
period of investigation and exposure mediumship and trance exhibitions slat
ewri ting etc proved so profitable that many sleightofhand performers
legerdemain artists and clever people engaged in it for profit
and it seemed impossible to distinguish the genuine from the
impositions there was so much discussion and dispute that in
1882 the psychical research society was formed in lon don
and a few years later an american branch was organized
a large number of distinguished scientific men participated in this
work which many thought would result in demonstrating diat spiritualism
was humbug and fraud from beginning to end the american
branch as sisted the university of pennsylvania in form ing
the seybert commission to investiie the phenomena of spiritualism and
mediumship and they promptly exposed a number of fraud ulent
mediums and their work presented a report and dissolved this
was far from satisfactory as it simply showed that a
num ber of imitators of spiritualist methods had hoaxed a
large number of people it left un solved the question
whether others were not genuine and whether there were not
definite natural laws underlying the phenomena so the psychical research
society continued its work and has now been active for
more than 35 years and published voluminous reports or proceedings
several of its prominent members have committed themselves to a
definite con viction as to the truth of many of
the phenom ena and the genuineness of communications with intelligences
called dead but living on the higher planes their most
exhaustive experi ments were made with eusiia paladino and leonora
piper and for particulars of their work ihe reader is
referred to psychical re search in this encyclopedia mediumship and
its methods spiritual ibon is based on mediumship or the
use of a human hdng as a means of communication
be tween discamate intelligences or dead people and living persons
these mediums are usually persons of a nervous temperament and
they al ways must be passive to develop what is
called the fpoiter hut whiia might be better dfr scribed
as the ability to interpret by submission of the will
and voluntary senses it is a sub jective psychic process
and very wearing and trying upon the nervous system of
the meditan and it has been contended that the disposition
of mediums to impose upon the public was largely due
to the fact that the woa so ex hausted them
that they were unable to keep up with the demands
of their sitters and so faked interviews with the dead
to give them satisfaction impressional or inspirational mediums are those
who do not go into a full trance but are
quite conscious of their sur roundings and who when under
this slit control make addresses or write that which is
impressed on their minds from the other side of life
this has been done so frequently and such wise and
learned utterances nave at times come so fluently from mediums
of moder ate education that the fact of their being
more or less inspired bv intelligences of greater abil ity
than they lb em selves possess has been widely admitted
the automatic writing form of mediumship is akin to this
the medium takes a pen or pencil and wails until
some influence seizes his or her hand and writing proceeds
the composition may be good bad or indiffer ent but
since such a reliable man of world wide fame as
william t stead in his letters from julia admits his
band was controlled and that the letters came from another
intelli kcncc and so gifted an authoress as elsa barker
has given us letters of a living dead man and
the son of that dead man has recog nized his
father from the information and some hundreds of other really
valuable books have been produced in this way the public
is becoming less skeptical the planchette and ouija board furnish
another means of mediumship the method being described under those
terms trance mediumship is of several varieties its leading characteristic
is that the medium goes into an artificial sleep similar
to that into which the suiject of a hypnotist is
thrown in fact all the conditions of hgtpiicitism and trance
mediumship appear to be identical except that the control in
one case is a dis carnate spirit and in the
other a living hyp notist tliis phase of the subject
is very fully covered in f huntleys the great psycho
logical crime see also hypmonsm in this encyclopedia the medium
in a trance usually informs the sitters around that a
certain in dividual is present and the sitters are priviled
to ask questions which the medium will answer for the
spirit the evidence that such testi mony is not faked
is that in a vast number of instances facts have
been told of whicli the meltuum could have known nothing
and medi ums have been known to speak in languages
of which thev were ignorant and in many other ways
uie testimony has been held to transcend the ability of
the mediiun to manu facture materializing mediums are rare and
this phase of mediumship has been most ques tioned 1
still there are so many instances well attested that it
is hard to discredit them a state of darkness or
neardarkness is insisted on and portions of human bodies or
an entire individual will be materialized and presented to the
view of the audience sometimes walking among them and touching
some of them ds well as engaging in more or
f d google spirituaiiism it has been explained that this
is accomplished by the mediums control who draws upon the
medium and he sitters for magnetism and a certain amount
of material matter and builds this about a spirit form
so that such spirit fonn is rendered visible for the
reality or non reality of this phenomena the reader is
referred to the bibliography at the close of this article
the subject is so disputed and so difficult of proof
that it cannot be discussed at length here with profit
in addition to the foregoing there are mediums who have
practised a variety of cabinet tricks as of speaking through
trumpets ilaying musical instruments etc wnile securely tied within a
dark cabinet on the stage the instrument being in full
view of the audience and seemingly sounded without himian agency
there is also a form of mediumship called table tipping
which was very popular in eng move about with no
visible person ment this seems to have been a form
of levilation and this is fully discussed under that word
theories opinions snd beliefs spirit ualism is regarded from four
different view points by as many classes of observers first
are those who are easily convinced of the reality of
the communications with the socalled dead who consider practically all
mediums honest to whom the philosophy has beoome a religion
and who derive a great deal of com fort from
attending seances and meetings and getting messages mostly to the
effect that their loved ones are well and happy these
are open and avowed spiritualists who resent any imputation as
to the accuracy of the phenomena second come those who
believe the phenomena are produced wholly by trickery legerdemain and
magic and constitute a great psychic fraud on the public
as a subclass to these are a few who believe
that if there is anything in it it must be
the work of the devil or his subordi nates third
are those who admil the genuine ness of the phenomena
when not faked but who contend that 4uch commtmications only
put sitters in touch with the lowest and least desirable
class of spirits with the ignorant immoral and undeveloped spirits
this being why itualisi farther use for it fourth comes
those who hold that the phenomena so widely exhiuted is
sometimes produced by trickery and sometimes by telepathic suggestion by
dairvotance telepathy and natural powers not wholly understood some of
this class like sir oliver lodge qv have come out
openly and admit their conviction of the absolute proof of
intelligent communication with disembodied spirits and others like the late
william james qv are inclined to think that the phenomena
which they admit may be large the refiei action of
their own minds or the minds of others on the
earth plane it is this fourth class who largely consulule
the members and followers of the society for psy chical
research that deep thinker and ex plainer of darwins theories
of evolution mfred russel wallace said in chambers encyclopmdia spiritualism
has grown and read continually till in spite of ridicnle
mis representation and fersecution it has gained converts in every
civilied portion of the globe sir oliver lodge has written
i tell you with all the strength and conviction i
can utter that we do persist that people over there
stitl take an interest in what is going on here
that they still help us and know far more about
things than we do and are able from time to
time to communicate with us condnsicmis the conclusions of the
higher intelligences who have expressed them selves as bang convinced
of the reality of spiritualism may be summed up as
follows through mediumship is proved the continuity of life beyond
the grave it is no longer a religious dogma but
a living fact saritiial in telligences are as anxious to
communicate with us as we with them but the lower
and grosser intelligence seem to be the nearest to us
and most hkely to be beard from in communication and
they like to impersonate great individuals and personal deceased friends
of those present this is held to account for much
of the infor mation that comes through and is valueless
for many years the banner of light published in boston
was the leading orn of this cult in common with
other spiritualist papers it has disappeared they have apparently given
way to psychological fiublications and new thought periodicals while the
great public includes a vast number who are viritually spiritualists
they are less and less known by that name but
are affiliated with new thought mental science theosophy oriental cults
psychical research and other modem movements spiritijalistic teaching is largely
in accord with the writings in the bible the familiar
spirits were very much like some modem ones that come
to mediums the witch of endor the ghost seen by
balaam the experiences of many of the prophets and saints
are paralleled in spiritualism seers of all ages have testified
to various things about the future life that are in
accord with what comes to us through the seance room
emmanuel swedenborg qv one of the most modem seers has
told in many volumes of his experiences in the heaven
worli which he was able to see and visit without
a mediimi and this seems to be the distinction between
a secr and a medium the former sees elairvoyantly with
his own eyes the latter goes to sleep and takes

work on the italian renaissance later he studied at the
universities of basel ziirich and heidelberg he began with juris

as pastor was offered him he felt that he must
decline it he had begun to realize his mission as
an epic poet and there fore refused to work in
the field for which he had prepared himself his first
work prome theus und epimetheus appeared in 188081 it is
an allegory which symbolises the joys and sorrows of an
exalted soul striving to attain an ideal although the loyalty
to this ideal is paid for by a life full
of misery the style reminds one of nietsches zarathustra but
spitteler was not influenced by nietsche as that is chronologically
impossible rather the re verse is true although nietsche never
acknowl edged his indebtedness to spitteler the two works in
a way complement each other id nietsche we have direct

is predominant from 1870 to 1879 he spent in russia

spitzbergen had a luxuriant flora and there was also a
postglacial period of genial climate favorable to the development of
a varied phanerogamic flora the proximity of the guif stream
renders the climate espo cially on the west coasts less
severe than that of other places in the same latitude

and lichens rather more than 100 species of phanero gams

nearly a quar ter of these and next to them
in number of species are the cruciferous plants the larger
forms of animal life are foxes bears and rein deer

and seals abounding along the coasts the islands are frequently
visited by the norwegians and russians searfowl are at times

by wihoughby but the islands were known to the russians
before that time they were again discovered in 1596 by
the dutch navigator barents to the latter navitor the islands
owe their name in dutch spelhng spitsberghen signifying peaked mountains
the coasts of the chief islands have been explored by
many expeditions since that lime and during the 19th century
the islands were used as a base for expeditions to

the lampreys lepidosirens or mudfishes and the ceratodus or barramunda
possess a spleen which is absent from the suhkingdom in
certain aber rant fishes only in man the spleen lies
in the upper part of the abdomen and is situated
in the left hypochondriac region contiguous o the cardiac or
gullet end of the stomach its outer surface is smooth
and lies in contact with the under surface of the
diaphraem or midriff this latter muscle separating the spleen from
the 9th 10th and uth rjbs of the left side
externally the spleen is covered by the perito neum and
is connected with the sttimach by the omentum known as
the gastrosplenic band its internal aspect is concave and is
divided by a longitudinal groove or fissure named the hilum

the organ by the hilum in feriorly the internal surface
of the spleen is in contact with the pancreas qv

healthy adult is about five inches in length bv three
or four inches broad and one to one and onehalf
inches in thickness its average weight li seven ounces the

also sponge the horny skeleton formed of keratosej or spongin
produced by certain ani mals living in the sea and
of very low grade in the scale of life down
to a quite recent period they were classified as colonial
protoeoa the lowest group of animals but all naturalists now
treat them as separate phylum under the name porifera or
spongiana given to them because of the waterpores with which
tfiey are provided in such abundance these pores are ordinarily
and chiefly of two kinds both open ing into the
internal or digestive canals and passages which everywhere ramify through
the mass of the sponge there are large openings oscula
relatively few in number often guarded by special protective devices
such as circles of spicules or muscles capable of con
tracting the orifice and much more numerous small pores evernere
perforating the surface the latter are inhalent pores or inlets
which admit water to the internal passages from which it
escapes through the former a con stant current is induced
by the activity of count less flagella or little living
lashes generally confined to definite enlargements of the canals known
as ciliated chambers which constantly beat the water and drive
it ever onward in ope direction this current is a
veritable life ving one to the sponge bearing into the
diges tive cavities not only the minute organisms upon which
the sponge animal feeds but also supply ing oxygen for
respiration bearing away all waste and excreted substances and assistinr
in the fertilization of the eggs and the distribution of
the larvse some of the simplest sponges such as are
found among those with calcareous skeletons have but a single
osculum at the summit of a sacshaped or cylindrical body
the walls of which are perforated by many radiating canals
each opening to the exterior by an in halent pore
and ending internally in the central digestive chamber the walls
of such a sponge are composed of the spongeflesh formerly
called sarcode together with the skeleton secreted by certain cells
of the latter the flesh consists of three chiefly cellular
layers ectoderm mesoderm and cadoderm the ectoderm is tne sponge
slan and in the form of a layer of flat
cells covers the whole exterior and lines certain spaces or
chambers which are formed in many sponges by a process
of enfolding the en doderm lines all of the truly
internal chambers and passages and consists partly of flattened digestive
cells which line the central cavity and parts of the
radial canals and partly of cells which bear each a
flagellum with a collar sur roimding its base on their
free ends and whidi are confined to the ciliated chambers
these lat ter collared and flagellated cells are very char
acteristic of sponges and are found elsewhere only among the
protoaoa between these limit ing layers the mesoderm makes up
the great bulk of the spongebody and consists of a
variety of different kinds of cells of which the most
important are the reproductive from which the eggs and spermatozoa
are produced and the skeletogenous which secrete the ele ments
of the skeleton the great majority of spends are originally
of much the form just described which may be considered
as exemplifying the sponge in dividual but as they grow
they bud and branch in a very plantlike manner forming
many new oscula and many new partial individuals which often
reunite and enclose cavities lined with ectoderm in this maimer
colonies of large size and most varied forms are built
up and simple as the fundamental sponge plan is there
are few animals which present more complex struc tures and
whose morphology has been so late in being correctly explaineot
the skeletons of sponges may be calcareous or silicious or
horny or the latter may be combined with either of
the others the first two may exist in the form
of separate spicules presenting the most varied shapes characterizing the
different genera and species or built up into a more
or less continu ous framework horny or sponging skeletons consist
of fibres almost always interlacing branching and uniting in a
most complete and complex manner and sometimes strengthened by included
silicious of calcareous spicules or granules sponges reproduce asexually by
a mode of budding and growth similar to that just
de scribed or as especially exemplified in the fresh vgoogic
4s0 spo water sponges by the fonnation of gemmulcs which
arc complexlv formed buds protected by a spiculesheatn ana capable
of developing into a complete sponge colony they also reproduce
sexually b the union of ovum and sperma tozoon which
develops into a freeswimming ciliated larva planula serving not only
to reproduce the species but through its activity to distribute
these fixed and stationary animals except a few small frcshwater
species all of die sponges are marine and occupy all

the eastern mediterranean sea the west indies and the coasts
of florida and central america in the grecian archipelago crete
cyprus on the coasts of asia minor syria barbary and
the bahama islands sponge fisheries constitute a very important industry
the finest sponges are obtained in turkish waters the fishing
season commences in may and closes in sep tember or
october diving is practised and is carried on in a
rude primitive manner the diver who has no dress seizes
hold of a larse stone to which a line is
attached and sinks by means of it to a depth
varying from 30 to 180 feet keeping hold of the
rope he tears the xnges off the rocks within his
reach and es them in a net when he has
secured a netful he signals by means of the rope
to be drawn up modem diving dresses have been introduced
successfully in some places the west indian trade is annually
increasing and the fishing in dustry gives employment to 500
boats and over 2000 persons the bahamas and the coast
of florida are the best fishing grounds florida is the
only state in the union which has a sponge fishery
and there it is confined to the southwestern part of
the coast along the reefs and to the extensive rocky
shoals that lie between saint marks and anclote keys the
former is known as the key ground with its centre
at key west the latter as the bay ground with
its centre at tampa bay nearly all of the sponges
used in the united states were brought from the mediterranean
till ts52 when attention was called to the im mense
numbers that were growing in florida waters as soon a
il was found that the qual ity of these compared
favoiably witfi those of europe the merchants and fitiersout of
vessels of key west engaged very actively in the busi
ness of placing them on the market at first the
best qualities were bought from the fisher men at the
rate of 10 cents per pound as mediterranean sponges became
scarce and costly the florida sponges came into more and
more demand and their value increased proportion 180 a new
area of ground larger thar old one was discovered and
this ffave a new impetus to the trade in that
year appalachi cola sent out a small fleet of sponge
vessels which has since been largely increased and the industry
has been energetically pursued with good results the methods employed
in the fishery differ greatly from those employed tu the
mediter ranean small vessels carrying crews of from 5 to
15 men are fitted out for trips of from four
to eight weeks on the sponge grounds the crews are
paired off iulo small rowboats or dines to catch the
sponges one man stands in the stern sculling the boat
while the other kneels in the bottom amidship leaning over
the side and scans the bottom of the sea by
the aid of a waterglass when a sponge is sifted
the boat is stopped and the kneeling man uses a
threepronged hook attached to a slender oole 30 to 50
feet in length to secure it consider able dexterity is
required of both men to cure the sponges the arc
first spread about the vessels dedc in their natural upright
position so that they will die and while decomposing allow
the softened animal matter to run on freely when they
have been several days in this position they are taken
to the shore and thrown into the water in little
pens called kraals corrals where the remaining sub stance is
soaked and squeezed out after which the spools are removed
at intervals and beaten with a stick to facilitate the
process although most active prosecuted during the summer sponge fishing
is now followed more or less throughout the year the
vessels beginning their trips in january and working the different
beds successively from north southward the state of the weather
greatly affects the result of the fishery in some years
it has been a complete failure while in others it
has been very profitable always owing to the weather as
the natural beds of sponges have become scarcer prices have
advanced so that even if a vessel does not secure
as large a quantity in a given time as formerly
the finan cial result is aoout the same several varieties
of sponges are caught in florida waters there are first
sheeps wool which sell for 2 to 5 a pound
second yellow sponges which sell for 50 to 60 cents
per pound and third grass sponges which are coarse in
texture ana not durable and seil for 15 to 25
cents per pound other coarse grades are boat and glove
sponges when these are marketed they are trimmed and cleaned
of sand and shells and then pressed into small bales
of 300 to 120 pounds each in which form they
go to the wholesale dealers the yellow sponge especially is
subjected to a bleaching process to improve the color but
the process ordinarily employed greatly weakens the fibre owing to
the rapidly decreasing supply of d google spongbucuhbkt 8f0ntini 481
the rner grades and the rising price the prob lem
of propagating sponges artificially has been taken up seriously by
the united states bureau of fisheries it has been found
that sponges may be raised successfully both from the egg
and from cuttings but owing to the much shorter time
required for the latter to reach a marketable size the
first method has been abandoned the technical problems of sponge
raising have been largely solved and there is every promise
that their culture on a commer cial scale can be
undertaken in the near future and that the depleted grounds
will be restocked the florida sponge fisheries employ about 25

spohtanbous coubustioh see combustion spontaneous spontaneous generation the doctrine that
living matter may orinate spon bodies as of maots in
flesh and mold on vegetables was formerly accounted for by
re rarding them as the direct products of the decay
or putrefaction in wwch thev occurred throu some unexplained process
the italian experimenter spallaniani qv first indicated the probability of
the source of these growths beinp living things or their
germs preexisting in the atmoshperc he found that when he
bound organic solutions as bee fb roth or an infusion
or tea of hay in a vessel closed against the
admission of air no appearance of living beings or any
evidence of generation followed and the same freedom continued when
the air which entered vessels containing fermentable solutions was made
to pass fir through sulphuric acid through redhot tubes and
tnrou cottonwool that the air does actually contain large quantities
of minute organic bodies was demonstrated by tyndall in his
efforts to obtain optically pure atmosphere and this explains why
preserved meats keep for any number of years if properly
closed since after their thorough cooking the aper tures are
hermetically sealed while steam is still escaping the entrance of
atmospheric air with its contents being thus prevented listers antiseptic
treatment in surgery is based on the same hypothesis but
while spontaneous generation is unten able as an explanation of
phenomena now in progress science knows nothing of the original
development of uving things some scientists have held that life
comes to the earth from the theory that there is
a life element in ture not appreciable to mans five
senses but which under right conditions brings vegetable animal and
human life into matter until we know what life is
no theory of spontaneous generation will maintain evolution is incom
plete as a scheme of the universe without the hypothesis
of spontaneous origin of living things from inorganic matter therefore
many regard life as a problem to be solved only
by occult means or by the reincarnated man after the
death of his physical body this is a matter in

are still disputing in rerd to those earliest stages in
the evolution of the sporophyte which are found in the
algae and fungi but there is complete agreement that in
all plants from the liverworts and mosses to the sunflowers
and orchids the sporophyte be gins with the fertilized egg
see alternation of generations leaving out the algse and fungi
and beginning with the liverworts the evolution of the sporophyte
can be traced with more or less certainty before considering
the details of development it may be said that in
such early stages of evolution as are seen in the
liverwort and mosses the sporophyte has no leaves or roots
and is dependent upon the fametophyte throughout its lifetime in
the enis and their allies the sporophyte is de pendent
upon the gametophyte during its early embryology but soon develops
leaves and roots and becomes completely independent of the retophyie
which then dies and disappears the seed plants the gametophyte
is the parasitic generation and contributes very little to the
sporophyte except during the first few divisions of the fertilized
eg several of the most fundamental features in the evolution
of he sporophyte are seen in the liverworts in riccia
one of the lower liverworts the sporophyte is a small
globular body about onesixteenth of an inch in diameter and
con sists of a central mass of spores surrounded by
a single layer of cells fig 1 a the signifi
cant fact is that the entire product of the fertiliied
egg excrat a single protective outer layer of cells produces
spores theoretically die earliest sporophyte should be one all of
whose cells produce spores in riecia a ungle outer layer
of cells has been diverted from uie spore producing function
to serve as a pro tective layer botanists speak of
this diversion as the sterilization of sporogenous tissue the evolution
of the sporophyte is marked by more and more sterilization
of sporogenous tissue so that less and less of the
product of the fertilized egg is devoted to the production
of spores in some liverworts alt the spores are derived
from onehalf of the fertilized g all the cells derived
from the other half bii diverted to a vegetative function
this is d google shown diagnuttmatically in fig 1 b
where s indicates the ipore tissue and v the diverted
or vegetative tusne in most liverworts even less oi the
product of the fertilised egg develops into spores not only
onehalt but a large part of the other half being
diverted to a vegetative fanction this dltcrted portion forms a
foot which acts as an aboorbine organ and a stalk
which becomes much eloogajed wid placei the spores in a
more favorable position for dispersal when they are shed fig
1 cf foot s stalk jp spore niuritive tiuiciion or
aid in the dispersal of spores in aathoceros a much
studied liver wort there is a still further steriliiation of
spororenous tissue a central column being di verted to vegetative
purposes so that the spore tissue forms only a thimbleshad
mass the lower part of which is shown in longitudinal
section in fig 1 d in this case the youngest
spore tissue is at the bottom and the mature spores
higher up a continuous growth in the lower portion resulting
in somcwliat prolonged period of spore produciion in the mosses
there is still further slerilizatton so that a comparatively small
portion oi the orophyte produces spores jn all these sporophytei
there is more or less green tissue so that there
is gome advance toward independence but there are no leaves
and the sporophyte live and dies wii its foot attached
to the gameto fhytc the simplest form among the ferns
and em allies has a root stem and leaf and
so is independent there is no form intermediate be tween
a sporophyte without a leaf and a sporophyte with a
fairly well developed leaf consequently the origin of the leaf
is still a problem in the ferns the spore tissue
is not only greatly restricted appearing only as the fruit
dots on the underside of the leaf hut it often
appears late in the life history of the tlaut in
the flowerine plants there is still iss spore tissue and
it may appear still later in the development of the
plant in some of the cycads die plant may reach
an age of 25 years or even more ixtoxc any
spore tissue is produced there is such a tre mendous
difference between a flowering plant and the small simple sporophyte
of riccia that it hardly seems possible that the large
complex form could represent a final tot stage in an
evolution resulting from a pro gessive sterilization of sporogenous tissue

openings for taking in aohd food or ejecting waste so
that nutrition is purely osmotic and 3 contractile vacuoles the
life cycle always includes a period in which a large
number of spores is produced and usually two such periods
alternate in one spores are produced asexually by schizogony and
in the other by a socalled sexual process sporogony these
two occur in different organs if not in different hosts
so that alternation of genera tions is regularlv associated with
alternation of hosts the aeveloptnent is often extraor dinarily complex
and no decision as to position or relationships can be
reached until the life history is worked out as this
has been done in but few cases the classification and
descrip tion of the group is subject to constant and
marked changes the sexual phase which may involve isogametes or
heterogametes is re garded as more sieicant than the asexual
in deciding relationships the class sporozoa as originally conceived by
leuckart 189 embraced not only the gregarinida coccidioidea and heemosporidia
which later sdiaudinn grouped together as telosporidia ie those forms
producing spores at the close of a stage in the
life cycle btit also the neospondia which produce spores con
tinuously the latter winch have amoeboid spores and one or
more polar capsules are now grouped in a seiurate dass
the cnidosporidia by many they include the orders myxospori dia
microspondia acttnomyxidia sarcospori dia and haplosporidia the gregarinida are chiefly
araropod parasites they begin the asexual stage as intracellular parasites
in the intestinal wall and desert the cells to become
adult in the in testine of the host they are
elongate and th cell is often divided into two regions

the host cell shrinks as the para site grows until
it is reduced to an empty cyst membrane within which
the parasite breaks up into a number of crescentic spores

the maintaining and enforcing of clearcut amateur conditions surrounding the
entries and contests of the various athletic clubs and the
elimination of professionals surreptitiously get ting into the ranks necessitated
a unification of clubs and setting up of jurisdiction centred
in some body in england the amateur athletic association a
a a was founded in 1880 at oxford confederating the
letimate clubs after the new york athletic club for three
years had managed the amateur championship meeting they had established
and successfully carried on the new york athletic club de
termined in 1879 to give up this management the clnb
had found the games profitable but the calls for the
officers time was too great in appeals as to decisions
on athletic law informa tion as to the dates of
the games programs entries etc so the new york athletic
club decided to hand over the conduct of the cham
piontp games to a regularly organized asso ciation of athletic
clubs such was formed under the titk national associa tion
of amateur athletes of america but abuses crept in and
the good name of the amateur sports was endangered this
led to the determination to form a national amateur union
of clubs under the tiue amateur athletic union of the
united states which was organized in 18fs relia bility of
the records is the outcome as george p meade well
expresses present condi tions the rules of the records are
limed l at least three skilled timers distances are accurately
surveyed and are remeasured in case a claim for a
record is to be made strict rules are observed to
prevent mistake or fraud at the start and finish and
unusual circum stances such as favoring winds are noted by
judges and referee finally the performance is investigated by a
committee of the national athletic board of the country in
which the race was run and every circuinstance that might
affect the validity of the record is discued before the
record is sanctioned these pre cautions apply only to amateur

caaiiem schacder avenigb 256 16 sports in plants a term
in biology denoting an individual which differs more or less
markedly from the type or parent species an abeirant conn
it is distinguished from monstrosity by its ability to transmit
its aber rant character either sexually or asexually to offspring
whereas i properly s rimn of sports has furnished much
food for speciuation some biologists assuming that aberrations are freaks
which nature destroys while others de clare that the transmutation
of species is de pendent upon them through the processes
of natural selection of the adaptive ones if the term
is to be used as an approximate synonym f monstrosity
the first hypothesis is probably true but if used in
its broadest sense the latter is more nearly correct the
matter hinges mainly upon the extent of observation lor vhile
sports among undomesticated animals are comparatively rare they arc numerous
among uncultivated plants but have been commonly overlooked because biologists
have been more awake to the animal than the plant
each leaf hud of a plant is capable of producing
leaves and branches which differ from those produced by any
other bud and every ffowerbud may produce a flower unlike
any of its fellows nay further the individual seeds which
fallow any flower in a single fruit may produce plants
unlike one another in many respects and also unlike the
parent but unless these departures are striking enougfa to attract
the attention of the ordinary observer as distinct they are
un noted and hence not calculated upon hence the popular
opinion that sports appear suddenly since only the remarkable cases
are observed they can be no doubt that sports result
from unusual or complex stimuli or unaccount able re frangibili
ty of vegetative force and for these reasons may be
usually are unstable when normal conditions are again operative however
this does not oppose but it rather en forces the
statement that sports result from the same causes as underlie
all variation in the plant kingdom budvariafion being one of
the most important and significant pnenomena of plaiitlife but though
the causes are usually un known in plants and vertebrate
animals sports have been produced artificially with diverse lepidopterous insects
by varying the hunudity dryness and temperature of the air
during the process of growth or pupation the crossing of
the sports with the typespecies does not usu ally result
in an intermediate form but in two main groups in
one of which the offspring re semble the male parent
and in the other the from a practical statidpoint selection
and breeding of sports has long been widely em ployed
among domestic animals one of the most striking instances is
that of ancon or otter sheep the ancestor of which
was a long hodied crookedlegged freak which was bred to
sheep of normal character only the in dividuals which resembled
the aberrant parent were used for subsequent breeding with do
mesricated phints the practice of breeding from the sports is
still more striking because it can be practised either sexually
or asexuallv the initial sport may appear as a seedling
or as a budvariation in the former case the gar
dener usually progagates by means of seed rigorously discarding all
specimens that depart unfavorably from the anparent intent of the
primal sport and carefully saving those sped igic spot spotswood
mens that approximate or accentuate the char acters if tfie
sport is a budvarialion the gardener usually propagates il by
means of cuttings practising a careful suppression of in dividuals
which seem to retrogress and select ing desirable ones for
further pronagation as in the former case it may seem
expedient to practise asexual methods with a plant pro duced
sexually or viceversa in each case however the afterselection is
imperative some bud varieties fail to come true even from
cuttings and failure in this respect is common among seed
sports budvariation and seedvariation are the same kind since the
same means of improvement can be used in each far
from being comparatively rare sports are very common among cultivated
jjlants al most every species of importance furnishing in stances
among wellknown budsports the purple or copper beech purpleleaved plums
and many weeping variegated and cutleaved trees and shrubs are
familiar examples the peru des jarditit rose has given rise
to several commercially important budvarieties the mossroses are budsports the
mixing of potatoes in the hill is also well known
among plants propagated by seeds instances are legion tomatoes cabbage
corn parsley onions and a host of garden flowers probably
the most striking instance of a plant producing both bud
sports and seedsports of value is the peach occasionally a
seed will produce a smooth tinned fruit popularly called a
nectarine which in turn may produce either a nectarine or
a peach certain branches of the peach tree may produce
nectarines and viceversa russet ap ples are sometimes seen upon
greenins trees the sports may occur in any part of
the parent plant roots tubers rbiiomes stems flowers leaves seeds
and even buds upon the stem or the roots another
practical application of the tenden9 to sport among plants is
the grafting of fruit trees with scions taken from the
bearing wood of specially prolific or precocious trees of any
particular variety such scions usually com mence to bear earlier
or produce more regu iarlgt or both than scions taken
from shaded portions of the same parent trees or from
im produciive individuals one of the common troubles with sports
is selfsterility this is scarcely important ex cept with fruit
trees where if large blocks of one kind of tree
are planted remote from other varieties that blossom at the
same time little or no fruit will be set see
paragraph varie ties under title apple sports are to be
distinguiiihed from rever sions in which the individual seems to
hark back to the general form of its more or
less distant ancestors they must also be separated from cases
of atavism qv in which the progeny exhibit a character
not typical of heir race species or genus but characteristic
of an allied ancestral race instances of reversion qv are
the loss of the bulbous root of turnips and the
head of cabbage which run wild of atavism the occasional

general grant it was evident to my mind that the

lees cavalry had reached open ground one and onehalf miles
from the court house when from a piece of wood
200 to 300 yards in front it received a heavy

covering spottsyl vania court house with andersons corps on the
left resting on po river ewells corps in the centre
and hills on the right covering the fredericksburg road the
line was 8 to 10 miles long and the greater
part of it ran through woods tanglea with undergrowth or
on the edge of them with slashings and abatis in

artillery during the 9th lee was employed in rectifng and
strengthen ing this line and grant in examining and de
veloping it and also in readjusting his own lines skirmishing
was sharp on both sides and early in the morning
general sedgwick commanding the sixth corps was killed general wright
succeeded to the command of the corps early in the
day burnside nioved across from the plank road to the
fredericks burg road at the crossing of ny river east
of the court house and threw one of his di

loose from the army and started from todds tavern on
his richmond raid burnside had reported to grant that in
his movement on the 9lh he had met the enemy
east of the court house and judged from indi cations
in his front that lee was meditating 3 movement north
toward fredericksburg upon which grant ordered hancock to make a
move ment on the 10th on lees left across the
east and west bends of po river this movement led
to the engagement on po river qv while this battle
was in progress warren was engaged in feeling the confederate
lines in his front preparatory to an assault and gibbons
division was withdrawn from hancock and placed on warrens right
and for the time under his orders at u am
gibbon advanced wilji two brigades met an obstinate resistance from
fields division and was compelled to fall back with much
loss warren followed with two of his own divisions with
a view to gain ground for the formation of a
column of assault and was repulsed by fields buthe had
gained information of fields position which induced him to report
to meade that a general assault would be successful hancock
had been desatcd to make the assault at 5 pm
with the fifth and sixth corps and part of his
own but he was engaged at po river and at
345 pm meade directed warren to make the assault which
was done with crawfords and cullers divisions of the fifth
corps and webbs and carrolls brigades of the second the
assault fell upon fields division and failed warren being repulsed
with heavy loss including general rice killed general han cock
returned from po river at 530 pm just before the
close of warrens assault and at 7 pm made another
assault with birneys and gibbons divisions this assault fell on
geo t andersons brigade and greggs texas brigade both of
fields division some of the assaulting troops gained the works
held by the texas brigade and went over them pushing
back the texans 1 but a flank fire of andersons
brigade drove them out and the attack was re pulsed
many dead and wounded being left in side the works
the assaulting column fell back in some disorder the men
demoralized by the fruitless work at about the same hour
general wright on the left of warren made an assault
he had found what he deemed to be a vulnerable
place to a vigorous attack it was on the west
face of the noted salient held by rodes division of
ewells corps uptons brigade of the sixth corps reinforced by
four rcpments of neills was to make the assault supported
on the left by motts division of the second corps
which was to assault on its own front at 5
pm upton formed in four lines and the batteries opened
a direct and enfilading fire which ceased only when upton
charged from the woods and under a terrible front and
flank fire went over the confederate works broke doles brigade
and part of daniels captured many prisoners and eushed on
to a second line of works upon which e planted
his colors and captured a fourgun battery he had broken
the confederate ine to the length of a division but
moti had failed in his allotted task of supporting him
on the left and recovering from their surprise and temporary
disaster the confederates threw two brigades in his front daniels
r d johnstons j a walkers and steuarts brigades fell
upon both flanks and upton was ordered to with draw
which he did under cover of the darkness he had
lost about 1000 men many of whom were left dead
and wounded inside the con federate works he was obliged
to abandon the captured battery but he earned back with
him 1200 prisoners and several stands of colors farther to
the left burnside made a reconnois sance toward spottsylvania court
house and had a spirited engagement driving back the enemy
close to the fredericksburg road and intrenching a part of
his line as he reports within a quarter of a
mile of the court house in this engagement general stevenson
one of his division commanders was killed during the day
of the 10th the union forces engaged numbered about 38000
the losses were abbut 4200 killed and wounded but few
were missing the estimated confederate loss vras 2000 killed and
wounded on the morning of the 11th grant reported to
hallcck that in the six days fighting since crossing the
rapidan he had lost u general officers and probably 20000
men renewed his call for reinforcements which he hoped would
be sent as soon as possible and in great num
bers and assured halleck that he meant to fight it
out on that line if it took all summer find
ing that the confederate left was so well guarded he
made arrangements to attack the centre at a salient of
the line general wright was directed to extend his left
concentrate on that wing and he prepared to cooperate with
hancock in an assault hancock with the second corps was
to pass to the left of wright during the night
and assault the salient at daylight warrens fifth corps was
to assanlt the works in his front to keep the
confederates in them and on the extreme left burnside was
to lead the ninth corps in an assault the day
was very stormy and disagreeable and no d google spottsylvania

the brown house where they found uotts division and passing
over the intrcnch inents and as near to the picket
line of the enemy as posmble they began the formation
of the column of assault barlows division was formed across
a clearing in two lines of masses each regiment being
doubled on the centre brookes and miles brigades constituted the
first line and smyth and brown the second birneys division
formed on barlows right in two deployed lines mott formed
in rear of bimey and gibbons division was placed formed
within 1200 yards of the confederate the battle of the
salient the point to be assailed was where lees intrenchments
had been carried northward to enclose a space about a
mile in leneth and half a mile in width of
the general shape of an acorn the con federates called
it the muleshoe taken together the faces of the salient
or muleshoe covered about two and onequarter miles in length
and were occupied mainly by ewelis corps edward johnsons division
holding the apex or east angle of the works and
rodes division the west angle and face to provide against
contingencies a second line had been laid ofil and partly
constructed some distance in rear so as to cut off
the salient at its base in rear of this line
was gordons division as a reserve on ewelis right was
a p hills corps on his left was longst reels
commanded by r h anderson general lee had detected some
movements that indicated a withdrawal from the front of andersons
corps and under the impression that grant bad begun another
flank ing movement late in the day he ordered the
withdrawal of all the artillery in the left and centre
which was difficult of access that it shoula be done
before it was entirely dark and that every tiling should
be in readiness to move at any moment under this
order ewelis chief of artillery removed all but two batteries
from the line of edward johnsons division during the night
johnson discovered that the union troops were massing in his
front and convinced that he would be attacked in the
morning he asked ewell for the immediate return of the
artillery the men in the trenches were on the alert
when at dawn on the morn ing of the 12th
they saw a dense column emerge from the woods half
a mile in front of the salient and rush to
the attack johnson says they came on in great disorder
with a narrow front extending back as far as i
could see the charging column was barlows division led by
the brigades ygti brooke and miles it had been ordered
to make the assault at 4 oclock but owing to
a heavy fog ii was not sufiiciently light to enable
objects to be clearly discerned until 430 when the order
to charge was given birney on the right met difficulty
in the rough ground over which he movea but kept
nearly abreast of barlows line when the confederate works were
seen a wild cheer was given brodce and miles tore
down the abatis and tn the face of a deadly
fire spraiuc over the intrenchments and a desperate nanltf tohand
encounter ensued birney came up on time to have its
horses and cannoneers shot down before a gun could be
fired and in a very short time nearly a mile
of the works had carried general johnson himself and barlow
and bimey swept on for nearly half a mile then
thoroughly disorganized they were brought to a stand before another
une of works held by gen j b gordons division
and lanes brigade of hills corps as gordon was about
to charge general lee rode up and joined him evidently
intending to go forward with him gordon remonstrated tne men
cried general lee to the rearl and one of them
seized the generals bridle and led bis horse to the
rear and gordons men went forward and attacked the union
lines in rear of the captured works after a fierce
struggle in the pine woods the union troops piled in
one upon another six or eight lines deep were forced
back out of the works but held the outer side
of them the sixth corps coming up look post on
the right of the second occupying the line from the
west angle southward motts division joined the sixth corps at
that angle birneys division came next on the left then
giboons then barlows all set at work to turn the
captured intrenchments there was great confusion in the intermingling of
commands on a narrow front and the confederates now made
most determined efforts to recover their intrench ments anderson sent
troops from the left three brigades of hills corps came
from the right and for the distance of nearly a
mile amid a cold drenching rain the combatants en gaged
in a desperate struggle across the breast works general walker
the historian of the second corps says they fired directly
into each others faces bayonet thrusts were given over the
intrenchments men even grappled with their antagonists across the piles
of lo and pulled them over to he stabbed or
carried to the rear as prisoners general hancock had soon
as the first success was achieved pouring solid shot and
shell over the heads ot our troops into the space
crowded with the confederate brigades be even ran a section
of browns rhode island and a section of gibbs fifth
united states up to the breast works and thou the
muzzles protruded into the very faces of the charging confederates
the begrimed cannoneers for a time continued to pour canister
into the woods and over the open ground on the
west of the mccod house the contest had settled down
to a struggle for the recovery of the apex of
the salient between the east and the west angle never
before since the discovery of gunpowder had such a mass
of lead been hurled into a space so nar row
as that which now embraced the scene of combat large
standing trees were literally cut off and brought to the
ground by infantryfire alone if any comparison can be made
between the sections involved in that desperate contest the fiercest
and deadliest fighting took place at the west angle ever
afterward known as ltthe d google 448 spouting horns spragub
bloody anrle here wrights sixth corps had taktn post on
cominf up at 6oc1oclc all day long the bloody work
went on and stii the men of the north and
of the south were not gorged with slaughter the trenches
had more than once to be cleared of the dead
for it was not till 12 oclock nearly 20 hours
after the command forward had been given to the column
at the brown house that the firinr died down and
the confederates relin quishing their purpose to retake the captured
works began in the darkness to construct a new line
to cut off the salient during the day diversions were
made on both sides to relieve the tremendous pressure in
the centre on the right of the sixth corps warren
with a part of the fifth made an attack upon
andersons corps and was repulsed with a loss of over
1000 men on hancocks left burnsides ninth corps made an
assault and after lodging the head of column of potters
division inside of hills works it was attacked in flank
and driven back with heavy loss later in the day
general early commanding hills corps advanced from his works to
strike burnside in flank bumside was met in motion and
driven back to his works and early relumed to his
own lines the union forces engaged on the 12th num
bered about 66000 men of whom 6020 were killed and
wounded and 800 missing the records do not show the
number of confeder ates enj mated t and 10000 of
whom about 4000 were captured on the morning of the
3fh it was ascer tained that the confederates faiiinr to
recover their lost intrenchments had fallen back and colonel carroll
with a brigade of the second corps went forward to
reconnoiter found hem strongly intrenched on a new line at
the base of the salient and after a sharp engagement
withdrew dispositions were now made to turn lees right flank
and during the night of the 13th the fifth corps
followed by the sixth moved over to the fredericksburg road
the 14th was occupied in getting the two corps in
position tht confederates were found strongly intrenched on the fredericksburg
road in front of spottsylvania court house and an attack
was deemed inexpedient during the day the confederates attacked uptons
brigade of the sixth corps and compelled it to fah
back from an advanced position but the ground was immediately
retaken by a brigade from the fifth and one from

or twisting of a joint with stretching and more or

their sheaths being all involved in the injury while sometimes
even small portions of the articulating processes of bones are
separated all joints are liable to this accident but the
wrist and ankle are most frequently the seat of this
injury their lia ulity arising from their immobility compared with
such a joint as the shoulder which is more liable
lo dislocation a sprain is attended with violent pin and
the sufferer feels sick and faint swelling and discoloration rapidly
take place from extravasation of blood into the sheaths of
the tendons and the other surround it tissues through laceration
of the smaller bloodvessels subsequently the swelling is kept up
in consequence of the elfusion of serum from the incited
action which occurs thus the joint is much deformed and
great care is required in examining the parts to guard
against mistakes and to gain an exact knowledge of the
nature of the injury so as to ascertain decidedly and
at once whether it be a simple sprain or whether
there be fracture or dislocation for this purpose the radiograph
has been moat valuable if it is a simple sprain
the part af fected should be laid in an easy
position on a ihhow and confined in that position by
broad slips of bandage crossing the hmb and pinned at
each end of the sides of the pillow the part
should at first be fomented tor an hour or two
with cloths wrung out of warm water afterward it is
to be wrapped in cloths wetted with a warm lotion
say of sugar of lead one dram opium one dram
ana boiling water one quart these cloths when appuclt should
be covered with oiled sik or cotton to prevent evaporation
absolute rest is the principal point to be attended to
to secure this when there is much restlessness it somelimes
be comes necessary to use splints tn case of in
flammation a purgative may assist after the pain abates and
the swelling disappears gentle rubbing with a soap and opium
liniment is well and a light flannel bandage should be
applied if the joint remains weak and stiff stimulat ing
frictions will be found useful also the pouring of water
on the part from a height beginning with warm water
and after a time gradually reducing the leniperature till the
patient can bear it cold after each applica tion the
part should be well rubbed as other wise it tnay
become rheumatic rheumatism is a very common occurrence in parts
injured by sprains and fractures too great caution can not
be applied in bringing a joint whidi has been sprained

the water which falls upon the earth in the form
of rain or snow and sinks through porous soils till
it arrives at a stratum impervious to water where it
forms subterranean reservoirs at various depths when the pressure of
the water which tills the channels through which it has
de scended is sufhcient to overcome the resistance of the
superincumbent mass oi earth the water breaks through the superficial
strata and gushes forth in a spring or it may

kind having the power of recovering by their elas ticity
their natural state after bemg bent or otherwise forced interposed
between two ob jects in order to impart or check
motion or permit them to yield relatively to each other
a common variety of spring is the carriage or automobile
spring which diminishes concus sion between the body and the
frame or wheels another variety is the helical spring used
to crperate valves etc modern carriage car nages automobiles railway
cars etc springs consist of finely tempered pieces of steel
so formed and fastened together that they strengthen each other
while allowing free play for the natural spring of each
plate or leaf to act and by so doing to
absorb a large por tion of the vibration and jolting
caused by the wheels passing over inequalities in the road
the springs are mounted between the axles and framework so
that the wheels when passing over an obstruction or sinking
into a hollow compress or expand them in ine first
instance the motion bemg thus partly absorbed and partly passed
on to the frame in a much lessened degree and
with the shock consider ably deadened by passing through this
elastic medium carriage and automobile springs are made in a
variety of shapes the elliptic spring consists of two halves
fastened togeiner with bolu the top half is attached to
the frame and the bottom half to the axle by
bolts or slips in the centre varieties of the elliptic
are the halfelliptic or semielliptic and the threequarter elliptic in
which an iron attached to the frame takes the place
of onegthalf or more of the upper part of the
ellipse the grasopper spring is arcshaped with linking plates for
attaching to shackle the volute qtring is a tjpe now
in favor for heavy vehicles when a spring made up
of several leaves plates or laminations is compressed the various
leaves must slide upon each other this sliding motion is
crxistantly taking place while the vehicle is traveling to facilitate
the slide movement the leaves are lubricated the top member
of the ordinary auto or carriage spring is of stout
spring steel with lugs forged on each end of it
by means of which it is attached to the shackles
it is furnished with lubrica tors and slots throu which
the oil flows to the various grooves for highspeed vehicles
it has been found advisable to lengthen the spring considerably
and increase the circle of which the spring forms an
arc consequently the spring is more nearly horizontal in power
driven road vehicles radius rods are used to take up
the drive and other thrusts which tend to alter the
position of the rear axle in regard to the frame
the rods tend to locate the axle relatively to the
frame horn plates are used to prevent the side movement
of the springs while in some cases rollers are used
to prevent the axle from moving laterally relatively to the
frame the rollers come up against the surface of the
horn plates the helical spring is a length of tattal
of either round or rect angular section wound round an
imaginary cylinder it is commonly miscalled a spiral spring the
corkscrew gives an idea of the helical spring the spiral
spring is a length of metal wound in a curve
of continually decreasing or increasing radius when wound it is
quite flat the mainspring and the hairspring of a watch
are spiral springs the trembler spring is a flat spring
used in coits and in contact breakers in order to
make and break contact the volute spring is a combination
of the helical and the spiral spring helical and volute
springs are m general use in modern machinery of several
types but are especially used in in ternal combustion enirines
to return the valves to their seatings other uses of
the helical spring will instantly occur to every reader springs
natural outlets by which ground water reaches the surface the
more common small springs usually result from the outcrop of
a nonporous layer below a porous stratum the water which
soaks down through the porous layer being forced to move
laterally along the top of the impervious bed until it
emerges this type is usually called the hillside spring on
many steep hillsides or mountain slopes the soil acts as
the porous layer the bed rock as the impervious stratum
and whenever the soil is thin the water is forced
to the surface forming springs or swampy places sometimes the
water seeps slowly down into the earth along an inclined
porous bed until it reaches a crack or joint along
which it rises rapidly such fissure springs are often of
large sie and fre quently have a high temperature due
to the great depth from which the wafer ascends a
third type of spring common in limestone reons results from
the emeience of an actual underground river which flows through
a cave dissolved in the limestone such springs are frequently
of enormous size sometimes fur nishing power to run local
mills warm or hot springs are commonly termed thermal springs
the temperature vanes greatly ranging from normal to the boiling
point the heat may be due to the proximity of
still uncooled volcanic google 8pringtails bpur rocks or to the
great depth from which the water ascends along fissures the
hot springs of yellowstone are probably o the former type

of the projections teeth on a sprocketwheel which engages the
chain also the name applied generally to any wheel upon
which are radial projections that engage the chain passing over
it per haps the commonest form of sprocket is found
in the bicycle in which the pedal shaft carries a
large sprocketwheel which drives an endless chain which in turn
drives a small sprocket on the axle of the rear
wheel the early automo biles were also largely driven by
sprocket and chain mechanism a practice largely copied from bicycle
practice sprockets are of various de signs a maximimi of

chains are also used for power of belts or ropes
and sprocketwheels instead of pulleys they can be run at
high speed and some forms of chain are so constructed
as to be noiseless even at high speed sprocket chains
chains used for power transmission from one shaft to another
of the endless type and workingover sprocket or radical pointedtooth
wheels they are much used in die bicycle where the
tyiie known as the blockandsidclink is well nigh universal in
this type every other link is a block and is
connected to the one following by two steel side plates
between which the sprocket tooth moves this type of sprocket
chain was also extensively used in automobile construction but has
been displaced by the roller type of chain consisting of
sidehnks held together by rivets the latter encircled by a
roller these offer less friction as the chain takes its
place on the sprocket the chief advantage of the sprodtet
chain as a means of power transmission is its ability
to work with very little friction loss without slippage as
is the case with belts and ropes a fault of
the chain is its noise arising largely from the fact
that as the chain stretches and the sprockets wear down
in size the two no longer fit together and the
chain begins to rub upon and grind the teeth thus
increasing the woridng strain in modern practice the silent gear
chain has displaced all other types here the chain does
not lie with its rivets or blocks between the sprocketteeth
but carries them rather above or outside the teeth and
each link is provided with points at one or both
ends which act as teeth to engage the teeth of
the sprocket these points grip the sprocket teeth as they
come in contact with it and hav ing gripped it
they hold the chain in that por tion which insures

squashes thrive best in long seasons in warm situations and
upon lit loamy but only moderately rich well drained soils
in the north they are often planted too early and
are injured by late spring frosts and they often fail
to mature all their fruits because the early frosts of
autumn injure the vines to obviate these results the plants
are frequently started under glass upon pieces of sod or
in pots and are transplanted to the field when seeds
could be safely planted about three weeks is the max

of others upon a vine it is usually cut off
since other fruits often fail to form two or three
squashes are usually calculated upon per vine for winter varieties
summer kinds will often continue to bear until frost if

derived from the act of settling upon lands in the
man ner practised by the lapse of time the mere
fiossession of these settlers without any formal title to the
land ripened into what they consid ered to be a
rit although the titled proprietors of the soil were frequently
wholly ignorant of such occufkition of their property often after
a long series of years it became impossible to dispossess
them whatever their possession in its origin ma have been
it is true that the proprietors might and did institute
el proc esses and recovered judgment against the occupants but
the ofiicers of justice frequently could not execute the sentence
of the law and dislodge them from their possessions instances
not unfrequently occurred where the officers of justice and the
proprietors themselves or their apents were shot at or suffered
other acts of violence from the occupants in this critical
exigency which threatened the public welfare and which was perhaps
exaggerated by those men who wished to avail themselves of
the occasion to obtain popularity for political pur poses it
was thought necessary to pass laws which were to a
great extent similar to the roman agrarian laws and which
deprived the technical proprietor of a portion of his rights
and transfer red them to the possessor who had occupied
and improved the land under colomal laws and usages a
title to land by mere occupancy could not be acquired
by a possession short of w years by one of
the first laws promulgated by a state of the re
public on the question the legislature of mass achusetts in
1808 shortened this term to 40 this essentia change in
the legal rights of the titled proprietors in violation of
what they deemed to be the fair intent and meaning
of their contracts caused much excitement and dissatisfaction among them
generally it may be said that there evidently was hardship
on both sides it was not equitable on the one
hand that the proprietor should be deprived of his land
nor on the other that an innocent occupant who had
been suffered to remain in possession for 30 or 40
years undisturbed by the proprietor should be suddenly expelled and
stripped of the fruits of the labor of a whole
life by way of alleviating the difficulties of the case
it was provided in this law of i8c8 reeable to
a wellknown principle of die roman code that when the
proprietor should institute a process to recover his land the
oc cupant should have a right to claim an allow
ance for the value of the improvements which he had
made upon the lands thus occupied by him and which
were called in the roman law uielwranlei or metioratnenla and
by analogy in the popular language of new england bet
terments improvements which might have been taken to convey the
idea of melioramenta hcina already used in new england in
the sense of occupation in practice the law was more
unequal in its operation as regarding the proprietor of the
land from anotser circumstance for he beit usually a nonresident
or stranger and the occu pant being an inhabitant of
the same teiritoiy from which the jury was taken who
were to try the question of right between the parties
the proprietor was in the more danger of suffering from
the prejudice or hostility of the juiy the law remained
in operation and the lapse of time reodeted it less
and less unequal and injurious in its effects finally it
became the model of similar laws for all other states
of the union which respectively claimed the right to legislate
upon the matter according to local and from this claim
for legislation accord ing to local needs arose the cry
of popular sov ereignty which became identified with squat ter
sovereignty in that its adherents especially from tamp47 to 1861
advanced and strenuously advocated the theory that the question of

serving when folded round the body to retain the heat
assists through its outspread hairs in support ing the animal

see dauvkflr stair a succession of sts attording means for
a person on foot to get from a lower to
a higher level there are two main forms of this
one composed of a series of solid blocks generally touching
one another at one edge as when a series of
squared stones are built into a wall at either end
their small surface of junc tion merely steadying them and
the more com d google 47s stalactite mon sort in
which two slopin beams planks or meial girders called siring
pieces or strings support a scries of horizontal planks slabs
of marble or slate or plates of metal called treads
the above are the essentials of a stair the riser
which stands for the vertical distance from one tread to
another may be left open or may be tilled by
a lieht board a piece of open work cast iron
or the like in the case of a stone step
the tread is the uppermost surface and the riser the
front the surface turned toward the person who is ascending
there is a marked distinction between the straight and the
winding stair in a straight stair all the stis are
called fliers and the tread of each is of the
same width from end to end in the windinz stair
the steps are called winders and die treaas are much
narrower at one end than at the other the typical
winding stair is the spiral or corkscrew stair in french
called i cohmoion snaillike these are comrnonly built into round
towers the walls of which sup port the steps but
it is feasible to build them of wood or iron
and in modem libraries and other places of storage very
light spiral stairs are built for easy access to balconies
galleries and upper floors as in the stack room for
books or other place of deposit or storage a stair
may be made up of several short stairs called usually
flights thus in the case of a ratfier lofty story
there may be one or even two landings in the
height from floor to floor and therefore two or even
three flights if these landing give to the stair a
change of direction of w oegrees so that a person
ascend ing and going northward suddenly turns east ward or
westward the platform is called a quarterpace sometimes quarter space
if the change of direction is of 180 degrees the
per son ascending reversing his direction as from north to
south the word halfpace half space is used a combination
of toes methods is also used as where a platform
is associated with some winders the platform being then nothing
but a tread much wider than the others the height
of the riser and the width of the tread are
matters of great importance rules exist for xing these and
it is generally con sidered that the riser and tread
must be taken together thus if it be held that
each tread andriser should measure 18 inches then the riser
may be 65 inches high the tread 114 inches wide
this is often expressed by the formula a riser fi
inches a run of llj4 inches or by the phrase
the rise and run are to each other as 6v1
to 11 in modern build ings of no great cost
or elegance the stairs are often very much steeper than
this and the proportions may even be reversed or nearly
so in the case of a flight rarely used as
from the top floor to the roof the stair is
often an architectural feature of some importance in the interior
a large hall is sometimes devoted to it and the
stair itself is a principal part of the decoration perhaps
passing along three sides of this hall seeming to cling
to the wall as it ascends leaving be low an
open floor of considerable size which may be treated more
or less as a sittingroom and at the top communicating
with a gallery this gallery may be a highly architectural
mem ber being treated with colunms to support the roof
the objections to this treatment of a stair are the
great amount of space occupied and the opening of so
much of the interior to drafts of air and to
ready communication of fire i should only be used where
the building is with the same or an equally costly
material and rooling the whole with an architectural dome or
coved ceiling with or without a skyiigfai the tendency in
recent times is to use elevators in buildings of all
kinds public and private and in consequence of this the
stair seems to be considered sometimes a mere piece of
utility and for that purpose made as compact as pos
sible while in another building not more costly and splendid
it will be treated in the way described above it
is worthy of notice that any building in which it
is expected to give stately entertainments the staircase or hall
which encloses the stair will be treated in a more
stately way aixl this because of a tra dition that
the persons of a large assemble will seek the halls
and stairs peinaiis for more space perhaps for fresh air
thus in an opera house the stair is a very
important feature outofdoor stairs are seen on city tene ments
and apartment houses as fireescapes but they do not often
exist in connection with classical or neoclassical architecture they have
great picturesqueness of effect and are associated widi medieval architecture
both northern and southern and with the rough wooden buildings
of switzerland and ivrol the term stair is not often
used to cover the broad flight of steps leading np
to a portico nor for the steps of a front
door when they do not exceed 10 or 12 in
number nor yet for those in a terraced garden for
such outof door flights of steps the french term perron
may be used and is perfectly descriptive of the thing

term used in new york city and vicinity r sloop

forming water containing car bonate of lime held in solution

its carbonic acid and conse quently deposits its carbonate of

called stalagmites are formed on the floor of the cavern

a defect of speech due to failure in coordinate action
of certain muscles and their appropriate nerves it is analogous
to some kinds of lameness to cramp or spasm or
partial paralysis of the arms wrists hands and fingers such
as is sometimes attendant upon certain exercises for speech is
a muscular act involving the coordinate action of many nerves
and muscles the words stammering and stuttering prac tically denote
the same infirmity although stut tering is now limited more
or less to the futile repetition of sounds hile stammering
covers the whole defect hesitation glide stop hold ing on
to the sound as well as repeating it because stammering
is proved to be pretty wide spread in prussia great
britain and its colonies and the united states and uncommon
in italy and spain the question suggests itself whether languages
of teutonic origin are not more apt to generate it
than languages of latin origin this chief of the imperfections
of speech may be hereditary and it may be acquired
by imita tion like yawning it is infectious it may
be the abiding result of mental strain or shock fever
may bnng it on epilepsy hysteria or any affection or
strong emotion of the mouth h rarely shows itself earlier
than at four or five years of age it usually
begins in youth but may be produced at any later
age a much larger proportion of males than of females
stammer stammering used to be ascribed exclusively to the organ
of articulation the mouth to faulty selling of the teeth
or the jaws to the largeness and thick ness of
the tongue its weakness of movement its excessive vigor etc
at present in the re search for the cause and
cure of stammering full account is taken of the vocal
cords or cushions and the vocal chink stammering occurs in
the mouth the organ of articulation its proximate cause is
always in the larynx the organ of vrace sometimes the
lungs the organ of breathing complicate the uncertainty and unsteadiness
of the vocal cords and the vocal chink in the
larynx a current of air variously shaped by the mouth

an act for regulating the stamp duties to be imposed
on various docu ments in 1765 george grenville chancellor of
the english exchequer proposed a bill for tax ing the
colonies through a stamp duty no serious opposition was expected
but the mea sure aroused great excitement in america as
an attempt at taxation without representation in the united states
a stamp act congress con sisting of deletes from all
the colonics except ncv hampshire virginia north carolina and georgia
met at new york 7 oct 1765 and adjourned 25
october the action of this con gress consisted of an
address to the king peti tions to parliament and a
declaration of the rights and grievances of the colonies it
nro tested that the colonies could only be taxeo by
their own representatives in the colonial assem blies claimed the

al most unanimousjy preferred and the mulready allegorical envelope enjoyed

soon retired and thus originated the first postage stamp lecky
the historian wrote the stamp act must be deemed one
of the most momentous legisla tive acts in the history
of mankind the first postage stamp was the blad im
pression and found a serious drawback it was printed in
a ass ink and the consequence was that those dishonestly
inclined washed out the obliteration cancellation marks and used the
stamps over again in nine months red stamps from this
die were produced in a fugitive ink and thus the
first stamp black one penny naturally became a rarity for
col lectors early on account of its brief career it
is a source of wonderment how the british got along
for such a prolonged period without stamps of any denomination
but those of one penny and two pence for a
considerable time check letters were used on the four comers

1849 to meet the request of some hi othciats cameo

an occnlt art and practice the first of these false
labels came to light as early as 1340 four months
after the governments first issue by 1863 there already existed
a sufii ciently numerous quantity to justify the com pilation
and publication of a work detailing and describing these pseudo
franking labels the first of uiese worthies to accelerate labels
in commercial quantities was a ziirich switzer land forger his
specialty was swiss canto nals modena romagna and others and
his agent in basle obtained sleep prices for his wares
next cropped up a brussels citizen with false provisional parma

as fac simile or falsch on aeir colored reproduc tions

identifying specimens of the lesser known varieties but the dishonest
utilized the opportunity by expunging the fake declaration and selling
them as genuine and the contro versy goes on as
to whether they do not pro doubt aid to sift
the chaff to some extent in the ctkounter with the
great multitude of fakes forgeries are produced by altering originals
as well as by making facsimiles usually the first are
termed fakes and the latter for geries strangest of the
pseudo stamps are the bogus ones designed and invented fiction

made before 1898 the date when the fraud was discovered
by forgeries of the green one shilling stamp 1865 type

therefore had escaped official scrutiny and unknown masses had gone

by his clever discoveries in refinery improvements soon rnade the
concern wealthy and by 1865 it became the citys most

be receiving rebates from the railroads which were not extended
to its 25 rivals in cleveland while qeveland was the

largest oper ators in that field the vnse ones of
that thriving city declared that the unflang en ergy and
commercial talents of the standard partners assured the concern rapid
progress and the continuance of the extra substantial rebate in
transportation cost in spite of the clamors of its rivals
made their position posi tively dangerous to competitors cleveland slill
outstripped her rivals in the refining field but the oil
regions threatened to become a re fining centre pittsburgh and
the pennsyl vania railroad were making the cleveland future uncertain
the standard had to face such facts as that the
pennsylvania railroad and the erie railroad were allying themselves with
the empire transportation company and tbeir rivals were putfinc up
a refining plant in jersey gty connected with their pipe
line supply railroad competition was beccnning so keen rebates were
given profusely and so much secret dealing was being revealed
that each concern suspected its neighbor the new york central
was farced into the scrimmage in selfpro tec lion and
now by 1871 the refining that had proven so prosperous
refined oil prices began to drop rockefeller pric of 58
cents per gallon in 1865 had fallen to 2 cents
by 1870 his 43 cent margin was wied out except
17lt cents added to these ominous conditions foreign sales of
refined oil were decreasing rapidly for europeans were beginning to
import the crude oil and do their own refimng a
scheme was set on foot john d rockefeller and h
m flagler on oath red they not ihc originators but
disbelieved in the plan at first among the pennsylvania refiners
to combine enough plants and shippers to awe the railroads
into giving the combination special rebates and draw backs on
that of other people they felt as sured thus the
resners could control the situa tion and regulate the amount
refined and put np prices the extra rebate had been
allowed by the railroads to the standard oil company as
shipjers of larger quantities than those of competitors this concern
now purchased secretly a charter of a company that was
in liijuldauon and which permitted its owners the widest scope
of commercial action it was en tilled southern improvement company
and was owned and organized by a combination of railroad
men and oil refiners in 1872 they are said to
have obtained control of onetcnln of the refining capacity of
the country favor able freight contracts were made between the
southern improvement company and the penn sylvania erie and new
york central railroads nearly all the cleveland refiners subscribed later
and onefifth of the united states refining capacity was absorbed

com pany in everincreasing numbers all the oil region was
gained by the combine and large numbers of works were
dismantled and closed by 1879 the standard oil company held
almost a monopoly in cul transportation facilities in cluding pipe
lines and the standard alliance produced 95 per cent of
the countrys refined oil this alliance consisting of the principal
refining companies from cleveland to balti more in 1882 the
standard oil trust was formed for convenience of control and
man agement it placed all the stock in the hand
of trustees and corporations were organized in the diiterent states
that had business centres of the trust the growth of
the gigantic con cern was steady and its prosperity was
unin terrupted in 1882 the properties under control of the
trust were valued at 75000000 by 1892 this valuation had
grown to 121631312 50 per cent of the increase being
from profits in vested dividends rose from 5ji per cent
in 1882 to 12 per cent in 1891 but 1892
opened up litigation and a suit to oust the corporation
from its corporate rights for abuse of cor porate powers
the court decided the part nership of corporations illegal and
that such a combine was in restraint of trade illegal
etc hence the standard oil company was dis solved into
its 20 constituent companies in 1899 the standard oil company
of new jersey was organized to brin about closer unity
and provision for the claims of small holders of trust
certificates the former standard oil company of new jersey bad
a capital of 1000000 whereas the newer concern had an

the treaty of 1848 he added greatly to his reputation
by his conduct of this litigation during these years he
took no part in politics but sympathized with the freesoil
wing of the democratic party and favored the wihnot proviso
in 1856 he sup ported buchanan and in 1860 voted
for breck enridge believing that the election of lincoln would
imperil the union when buchanans cabinet divided in decem ber
1860 and cass the secretary of state re signed attorney7eneral
black took his place and stanton was made attorneygeneral 20
dec 1860 the day when the ordinance of secession was
adopted in south carolina at his first cabinet meeting the
question was pre sented whether major anderson should be ordered
back to fort moultrie floyd the secretary of war and
his southern associates insisted that this should be done while
stanton with blade and holt vigorously opposed them threatening to
resign if such orders were issued their altitude drove the
secessionists from the cabinet and redeemed the close of buchanans
administration during ilie re mainder of the administration he was
active in studying the plans of the secessionists and con
sidering how to defeat them and protect wash ington he
feared insurrection or assassina tion to prevent lincolns inauguration and
his influence helped to persuade president buchanan that regular troops
should be ordered to wash ington the attack on fort
stmiter found him a strong supporter of the national authority
and outspoken in calling upon all loyal men to stand
by the government jn 13 jan 1862 mr lin coln
aqgtointed him secretary of war in place of simon cameron
stantpn had criticized lin d google coin severely and had
not even met him since his inauration but lincoln selected
him for his ability and because he was a repre
sentative of the democratic unionists whose support was essential llie
wisdom of the choice was signally vindicated the whole system
of the war ofsce was inefficient and reorganization was imperatively
demanded stanton brought to his work great executive ability prompt
decision and a strong will which made itself felt through
the whole tnihtary service he had scant patience with men
who were seeking personal advantages or with irivotoua calls upon
hia attention hence his manner was brusque impatient and decided
and he made many enemies he advised the passage of
a law anthorizuig the president to take possession of all
the rail toad and telegraph lines of the united tales
and this was at once enacted he ordered that all
contracts for supphes and munitions be in writing appointed a
commission to investigate and dctemune what valid contracts were out
standing and waged vigorous war upon fraud ulent contractors by
an order of 14 february he directed the release of
all persons who had been arrested on suspicion of disloyal
practices with certain exceptions upon their giving their parole not
to aid the rebeuion from that time such arrests were
made only under military authority which was exercised on the
theory that all doubts were to be resolved in favor
of the country no part of stantons career shows more
loyalty to his country than his patience with ucclellan during
the first six months of 1862 but the latters delay
in moving his army to the support of pope his
disregard of orders and his whole conduct during tne critical
weeks which preceded lees invasion of maryland at length satisfied
stanion that he should be removed and in the last
days of august he tried to unite the cabmet in
recom mending this step but mr lincoln felt that mcclellans
popularity and the political situa tion made it necessary to
give tiim the com mand of the army stanton disapproved
this action as did mr chase but the president took
the responsibility mcclellans conduct of the antietam campaign his inexcusable
delays and almost direct insubordination increased stantons feeling and at
length convinced the president aud mcclellan was dismissed from taldng
office as a democrat stanton early felt the importance of
emancipation as a war measure and when on 22 july
1862 mr lincoln laid before he cabinet a proclamation declar
ing that all slaves in the seceded stales should be
free on a fixed day stanton and bates the attorneygeneral
were in favor of issuing it at once while seward
and chase opposed it stanton ajiproved the issue of the
proclamation after antietam and in his annual report made a
powerful argument in support of the measure when in the
next year after the defeats of fredericksburg and chan eel
lorsville lee a sec ond time crossed the potomac hooker
was re teved and meade appointed to the command by
tantons advice and during the critical sum mer and autumn
of 1863 he met every emer gwicy successfully when it
was apparent that general rose crans was not in a
condition to retain the com mand stanton summoned grant from
new or leans to louisville himself met him there and
after a full conference placed him in command of die
western armies giving thomas com mand at chattanooga tne immediate
success of general grant m his new command with general
grants appointment to the command of the army and his
removal to virginia fol lowed as a matter of course
after appomat tox general sherman agreed upon terms with general
johnston which provided not only for the surrender of the
latters army but for ihe settlement of vital political questions
and the agreement was disapproved by the administra tion stanton
stated the reason in a dispatch to general dix that
the public might understand why general sherman was overruled his
statemedt was clear and poignant and while it reflected on
general shermans discretion in consenting to such an arrangemedt the
general himself was not criticiied sherman belct stan ton especially
responsible for the action of die government and became very
hostile to him nothing in the history of the civil
war is more remarkable than the speed with which the
vast armies of the united states were dissolved on 1
may 1865 a million men were on the rolls of
the army in hardly more than 60 days nearly 700000
of them were returned to their showed the military force
