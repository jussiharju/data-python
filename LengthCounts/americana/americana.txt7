for testing materials steel the preservation op structural introdncuon the
treat ment necessary to secure the preservation of the steel
used in buildings bridges and other engineering structures is of
quite as much im portance as the original construction if
the structure is to stand the test of time the
durability of a steel structure will depend upon the quality
of the metal upon ils mass and upon the measures
taken to prevent its de terioration and its strength measured
either by the stress it will bear or by its
resistance to i only the strength of its weakest member
consequently the surface inspection of steel is one pi the
most important functions of the inspector and will remain so
until the steel manufacturer succeeds in producing a noncorrodible surface
upon his product rust more throu ignorance of the chem
ical action involved than for any other reason the appearance
of rust upon iron is regarded generally as merely the
effect of corrosion rather than as a contributing and continuing
cause of further deterioration rust on iron or steel is
formed by electrolytic action in which the iron is attacked
by hydrogen ions obtained from water the oxyn set free
unit ing with the continually forming iron hydrate it is
a loose porous mass containing about 20 per cent of
combined water with varying amounts of hygroscopic moisture and it
per mits the passage of water and gases throurh itself
to the metal underneath while facilitating the passage of the
destructive electric current by keeping the agencies of corrosion al
ways in contact with the surface of the metal not
yet affected this characteristic of rust to absori and to
persistently retain moisture makes possible the progressive corrosion which goes
on beneath it and furnishes a reason for the more
or less complete corrosion of rivers and screws frequently noted
in steel strtictures in the light of the now widely
accepted hydrolylic theory of corrosion this moistureholding prop erty of
rust becomes of the greatest importance for except in the
presence of moisture electro lytic action is impossible rust has
a tendency to grow and spread odi from a centre
each such centre is a spot ai which water has
been deposited in the form of drops or if the
metal has been completely covered with water it may be
the spot from which the water has last evaporated and
there fore where the liquid drop remained the longest time
sweat the condensation of the mois ture permeating the air
is always present on a surface of steel or iron
when its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding
atmos phere a wash of rain is less apt to
be in jurious to steel than the deposition of water
in drops or in a thin film over the surface
dew steel neither rusts in dry air nor in water
which does not contain dissolved air nor carbmi dioxide the
best protection will therefore be obtained from the most impervious
coating it may be noted that the general cause for
the failure of preservative coatings to protect steel from rust
is that th are permeable to moist air and carbon
dioxide which are the most common agencies for the corrosion
of the metal itself the contributing causes of corrosion may
be classified thus i lack of purity or homo gcneity

absolute cleanness of the steel from all deteriorated metal at

sign of what is going on cleaning any steel upon

material cannot from its very nature stick closely and uniformly
to a surface that is damp rosty or greasy neither
does it serve any good purpose when applied to loose
or detachable scale enneers differ as to the best method
of securing a receptive surface for painting however much of
the expense of re painting in the future would be
saved if all scale rust grease and dirt were removed
from the surface of the metal at the steelmaking shops
before applying the first coating of paint to new work
an oil or a varnish paint will be attracted to
and held well by a steel surface when it is
clean warm and dry such a surface can be had
and should be insisted on in the specifications all steel
as it leaves the rolls or hammer has a tough
thick or thin coat of loose or partly loose scale
that adheres for the time beii buf on short exposure
to the air with a few changes in temperature due
to mill or storehouse conditions releases its tension and is
liable to fall off whenever handled as in course no
surface of steel should be coaled unless it shows the
grayishwhite natural color of the metal and is dry and
warm the common method of cleaning ateel is to remove
grease with naphtha benzine rust and dirt with wire tnishes
and detachable mill scale with hammer and chisel the sandblast
is probably the iifost efficient if not economical method ot
preparing structural steel to receive a preservative coating it leaves
the metal be secured the painting of the metal should
follow immediately after the cleaning is done as cleaned metal
will corrode under ordinary atmospheric conditions much more rapidly than
unclean ed metal portable sandblast machines and portable air compressors
are now available the out fit besides these includes a
sand drying ap paratus hose nozzles etc the sand used
should be clean and hard if its particles are round
it will leave a smoother surface than if they are
sharp where the surface is veiy rusty and the metal
pitted a coarser sand is needed than for the removal
of ordinary weather rust it is argued against sandblast ing
that it should not be used to clean new metal
because it will remove the suboxide black oxide or mill
scale which in itself like paint is a protection against
mst formation so long as it remains while this b
true if the scale is entire it does not hold
where it is in jured and is without the certainty
of the sandblast method when pickling is used the pickling
liquid is almost always dilute sulphuric acid oil of vitriol
containing from 20 to 25 per cent of acid it
is preferably used warm and the articles are left in
it till the surface is per fectly clean and free
from rust and scale the lime will vary according to
the condition of the metal from a few minutes up
to an hour or more a much weaker acid than
that mentioned is sometimes used or the acid is used
cold but in these cases the article must be cleaned
with alkali before it is put into ae pickling vat
after the pickling the e from the surface is best
done by l charged at high pressure mere rinsing n
ing efficient for the purpose hydrochloric acid munatic acid is
not so satisfactory as sulphuric acid if the metal be
allowed to dry in the air die surface is likely
to rust to avoid this it should be put into
a boiling bath of milk of lime and left in
this until it has acquired the temperature of the bath
it is then taken out dried in an oven and
when dry this lime is brushed off the surface left
by pickling is susceptible to rusl and therefore a protecting
layer of some kina must be applied at once with
present facilities at steel plants and assembling shops neither space
nor time is available for cleaning steel either by pickling
or with the sandblast so the common practice is to
substitute quicker and less reliable methods of preparing the surface
to receive paint the process of galvanizing is described under
that title this article is limited to the discussion of
the most common method of preservation that secured by painting
paint at the present time oil paints are generally used
for coating structural steel while varnish paints may be more
efficient for metal not exposed to the action of rainfall
and sunshine or under some special conditions experience indicates that
oil paints are the proper coatings for preserving and protecting
steel used in building and engineering con stiuction oil paints
are pigment mixed and nralled with oil and especially designed
to preserve to protect and to better the appearance of
sur faces to which they are apitlied in oil paints
of valtm the end aimed at is a dose union
of solids pigment and liquids binder ie inorganic or solid
matter in a finely divided state is taken and mixed
with organic or liquid matter and then these are linked
together either mechanically or chemically ordinary me dianical mixtures in
which the solids and liquids have little or no affinity
for each other or in which the powders are feebly
suspended in the liquid scarcely deserve the name of paint
the essentials of a preservative and protective covering for structural
steel may be stated as follows 1 mfchanieal properties that
it must work properly that is offer bnt a slight
re sistance to the stroke of the brvsh and be
of google 8tbbl the prbsbrvation of stkuctural such fluid nature
as to flow together after the brush eo that the
resulting covering or slcin is one of even thickness 2
chemical propertiet that it must not only dry or oxidize
fast enough but dry siiuul taneouslv throughout not harden on
the sur face ana remain soft underneath or in painters
parlance skin over 3 physical properiitt tagtt it must be
of such nature that when it has formed a skin
upon the surface of the metal it can take other
coats of paint without loflenink under them hardness that it
must wear well provided a sufficient number of coatings of
it is applied durability that il must exclude moisture from
the metal covered with it imperviosiiy linseed oil after centuries
of use still holds its own as the best oil
for painters use where durability is the main consideration linseed
oil in drying changes from a liquid first into a
colloidaf form a sort of jelly and then to a
solid rubberlike substance which not only holds itself together but
also clings to any dry substance upon which it is
formed lin seed oil in drying takes something from the
air beautifully describes the process and calls it the breathing
of the drying oils in his book die chetnie dcr
austrocknenden oele he named the solid rubberlike substance into which
a layer ot linseed oil finally hardens ltnoxyn linoxyn is
a solid not a liquid it is insoluble in many
liquids and is far less soluble in any other solvent
than linseed oil specimens of it kept for months in
dilute acid and weak alkaline solutions also in spirits of
turpentine petroleum naphtha unseed oil alcohol chloroform acetone caroon bisulphide
and water show but slight decomposition or solution thus indicating
its power of resistance to atmospheric influences a layer of
dried unseed oil linoxyn is not strictly waterproof althou no
compound is probablv chemically more resistant to atmos pheric influences
not mechanical wear for example it is claimed that a
gallon of oil spread upon 100 square feet of surface
will outwear a gallon of any paint spread upon the
same area of a urailar surface but it may be
noted that it will require about three times as man
coatings of the oil to use up the gallon as
it will ot the paint to use it up from
this it is concluded that a layer of paint is
about three times as thick as a layer of the
oil experi ments of this kind demonstrate that one of
the functions of the pigment is to increase the thick
ness of the lar oe dried paint and that this
increase of thickness is in direct proportion to the volume
or fineness of the pigment they also determine that given
the same volume of oil and the same weictht of
pigment the greater the volume of the latter ie the
finer die division of its particles tne more slowly will
the paint dry and the longer will it wear figments
fit for use in structural oil paints are of two
general classes viz those that re act more or less
with the oil notably the car bonates and all of
the lead pigments and those that have no chemical action
on the oil or binder ie that are called inert
such as the carbons silicates probably ferric oxitjes etc the
former tlas produce the quicker drying and the less durable
paints the latter the slower drying and the more durable
coalings eg a paint made from white lead and linseed
oil when properly applied to a sound surface cannot be
expected to protect it under fair conditions more than five
or six years while a paint made from venetian red
and the same oil applied to a like surface under
similar con ditions will protect it easily twice as loi
another feature pertaining to inert pigments is that where the
same liquids are used with them for the paint for
each coating applied the ob server finds that the dried
paint seldom cradcs peels or blisters and if it does
the inference should be that his paint contained an inade
quate amount of pigment given a perfect binder the paint
problem would be simple for them me only function of
pigment would be to color and obscure the surface until
however a binder is obtained that will dry fast enough
that when dry is impervious to moisture and gases and
that will not wear out pigment wiu be necessary to
shield and to protect the dried oil from the agencies
that destroy it the chief of which are rainwater and
sunnc a pigment that will not hold the oil pro
duces a fugitive paint any pigment that will take and
retain oil or binding material and that is not changed
by the agencies that destroy dried oil or the binder
will make a durable paint for structural steel provided it
is fairly treated and properly applied to a surface in
fit condition to receive paint andes in his work on
anticorrosive paints in discussing the number of coats of oil
paint that must be applied to iron in order to
secure eigcicnt protection against rusting says that in establishing a
standard preference must undoubtedly be accorded to paints requir ing
a large proportion of oil to make them work properly
he says it may be laid down as a normal
standard that persupposing the use of good paint one bottoming
coat and three subsequent coatings laid on at suitable inter
vals will be required to produce a layer of sufficient
thickness on iron to keep moisture away from the metal
and to protect the latter from rust for a certain
time the first or prime coat upon a surface of
steel in a fit con dition to receive paint is
of the greatest im portance espedall as to its drying
hardenini adhesiveness and impermeability to water tlic paint used for
priming naked steel should be of a preservative nature ie
of such a nature that it will absolutely exclude air
and water from the metal and prevent the progress of
electrolytic action and that the finishing or top coats should
be of a protective nature ie of such nature that
they will protect the primer or bottoming paint from the
action of rainfall sunshine or any special external condition as
the first or priming coat must form a receptive foundation
that wul be able to hold all subse ltuent or
protective coatings both on and up it should be largely
formed of basic materials so composed as to secure on
the surface of the metal a firm and unyielding coating
of an elas tic durable cohesive and adhesive cement it
is probably necessary that this cement be made from a
pigment that secures chemical acticni between itself and the liquid
with which it is mixed for it is only through
the use of such a pient that a skin or
covering can be secured d by google 8tekl tme pftamplikkvatiltn
op atttvctuttal upon unheated metal that will be impervious a
series of exhaustive tests carried out by the american society
for testing materials established the fact wat among pigments the
best for preserving steel from corrosion was tine chromate known
commonly as zinc yel low following this and in the
order of rela tive efficiencj as preservatives of steel are

metallic painls it is the usual practice to apply as
a first coat one of the zinc chromate paints and
then a coat with a white lead and zinc white
base tinted as required a less satisfactory custom but the
one most generally followed is to apply a mixture of
the pigments named in one heavy coat where three or
more coats are to be ap plied and it is
not practicable to use more than two kinds of paint
one can use for middle coat mixtures of topping and
bottoming coats engineers architects etc should demand paints that do
not require great skill in their proper application the requirements
of an anticor rosive metal covering are that it 1
should hide the surface 2 should cement itself to gether
and also cement itself to either damp or dry metallic
surfaces 3 should expand and contract under changes of temperature
without breaking its own body 4 should pre sent a
hard yet tough outer surface 5 should be impervious to

should be homogeneous 13 should dry fast enou 14 should

mcnsture or dampness from the metal main causes for deterioration
of piunt are 1 water dissolution 2 action of light
and heat chemical ana physical change 3 diemical action between
pigment and binder disintegration 4 abrasion of mechanical injury motion
5 action of deleterious gases foul air a worthy metal
coating sometimes fails 1 because of improper application incom petent
or careless users 2 because of in suthdent quantity on
a given surface not re newed at right time perishes
quickly 3 because of an unstable foundation to stick to
dirt grease dampness or scale under it 4 because the
undercoating is more elastic than that over it cracks fs
because not protected when drying wet paint sensitive painting the
coating of structural steel with paint is for the special
purpose of pre venting air and water from getting at
it as a combination of these will aid in allowing
the setting up or continuance of electrolytic action the more
quickly if carbonic or some other acid be also present
many worthy paints are ruined because flowed on with a
broad thin flat brush not much better than a common
whitewash brush instead of being rubbed out and into the
surface well with a good full round bristle brush and
then again painters are apt if the pigment used is
heavy or the parts to be cov ered are difkcuit
of access to add an excess of thinners to save
time a layer of air adheres to all surfaces hence
the importance of rubbing out paint thoroughly as otherwise bubbles
of air may he covered which coming through the paint
render the coating porous it is known that the durability
of any oil paint de pends largely upon the number
of particles of pigment upon a given area of surface
and that the more particles of pigment the better the
protection to the binder and to the metal under neath
the evil of thinning too much is there fore obvious
as to the spraying of paint upon structural steel by
means of an air compressor it is objected that this
method conveys air and moisture to the metal the adherence
of paint will be increased if the metal is moder
ately heated before it is primed because if it is
wanned by artificial heat thesurface will be dry mill marks
even though made with inferior paint generally afford excellent pro
tection to steel because the paint was applied to the
metal when it was clean and warm when painting is
to be done in the field or under conditions that
make it impracticable to warm and dry the metal artificially
it is a good plan to apply paint heated to
a temperature of about iso f especially when the temperature
of the atmosphere is below ss f this warm ing
of paint may be attained by placing the paib of
paint in vessels of hot water it is import ant
that one should always note the atmospheric conditions when the
work of painting is being done a temperature of about
70 f and an atmosphere that is free from moisture
favor the right kind of drying humidi of the at
mosphere is even more important than its tem perature nothiiie
retards drying more than dampness and darkness to aid in
the inspection of new woii a shki coating of plain
linseed oil is often specified this does in a measure
protect the iron from rust but a veij uneven film
of dried lt1 prob ably will be secured from this
method of treat ment oil applied to a vertical surface
runs off until the layer reaches a certain thickness where
the current meets with an obstruction it piles up into
a thick and uneven coating these thick parts of the
layer may require months to harden into a substance firm
enough to be fit to paint over the results are
most disastrous in cold weather when oil thickens and contracts
as painters express it ltnl when applied to cold sted
crawls wrinkles and crinkles if linseed oil is used as
a primer on steel it should be used hot not
warm then it will penetrate the sldn of the metal

may be readily detected a distinguished british painter declares ltthe
less paint that is put on at each opera tion
consistently with a proper covering of the ground the better
will the ultimate result be the under coats should dry
more quickly and harder than those above them and the
difference in drying between adjoining coats should not be very
great from experiment with an ocular micrometer in connection with
a microscope it is found diat single coats of dried
paint vary in thick ness from 1500 to 11000 of
an inch the differ ence being due either to the
manner of applica tion ie whether under light or heavy
pressure of the brush or lo the difference in the

ness of coatings of paint or the strains to which
its dried films ace subjected the necessity of repeated coatings
until a sufficient thickness is secured is therefore obvious viaducts

result of this solid linoxyn a film of this dried

when painting is done testa paint tests may be of
three idnds namely chemical mechanical and physical tests chemical tests
in the selection of solids and liquids for paintmaking it
is well to loiow that they contam no deleterious matter
such as soluble solids or destructive liquids nor use less
substances either to make weight or to make bulk chemistry
can tell these thin but it cannot tell the quality
of the bulk of pamt materials used a chemical analysis
applies to very small quantities of the substances used and
the accuracy of the results obtained from it depend largely
upon the method of sampling when one considers that about
all pigments are allotropic that no two lots of paint
liquids are exactly alike and that any prepared paint changes
more or less in one way or another with age
the chemists test is proved to be of value in
so far as it relates to the matter subject to
his analysis and determinations and no further chemistry can tell
things that may have been used in making a paint
it can foretell some phenomena that it may develop but
it cannot at all surely predict its vis viva that
is what the stuff will do and what it will
do is the only true measure of its value or
worth hechanicsl tests by this is meant tests made by
a skilful painter no one can deter mine the working
qualities of paint as well as the man whose eye
and hand and arm are trained through practice the importance
of the proper application of paint receives less at tention
than it deserves eg air bubbles may be worked out
of paint by means of thorouf brushing with good tools
and then again a poor painter may use 50 per
cent more material upon a given surface than a pood
painter will use and get poorer results with il engineers
and architects therefore demand the employment of competent artisans to
do their painting for results are often more dependent upon
the intel ligence and goodwill of the painter than upon
the quality oi the material used physical tests by this
is meant weather tests or the exposure of the dried
paint on inetallic or other surfaces to the destructive forces
of nature such as sunshine rainfall frost dew heat cold
light darkness etc or to those agencies which are frequently
present in atmospheric air that shorten the life of dried
glint such as acid or alkaline gases and vapors omparative
tests on limited surfaces that is leading because a painter
cannot gauge his work with unfamiliar material and because his
brush probably will not be in condition to give the
paint a fair show in order to make such tests
more reliable they should be repeated a number of times
to note if results are concordant and large sizes of
plates should be used actual service tests under normal conditions
give the most conclusive data accelerated tests under abnormally severe
conditions have little value unless the results obtained by the
method selected will be in harmony with long time service
tests it is easy to test the water proofing quality
ot a dried coating of paint but such a test
determines nothing more than the ability of the paint to
exclude water from the surface underneath it it is easy

to iron and carbon there are four other elements present
in ordinary steel whose effect must be considered they are
manganese silicon sulphur and phosphorus these art often considered as
impurities since it is almost impossible to make steel free
from them the former two elements however espe cially manganese
must be considered essential and beneficial while sulphur and phosphorus
are nearly always welcome guests copper and arsenic are also
usually present in minute quantities and their effects are negligible

it cannot be eliminated but because it is frequently added

be found in the finished product ordinarily steel then by

which yields a steel suitable for rails springs knives drills
or gun barrels may be considered as a special steel
such is not the commonly accepted significance of the terms
speciai and alloy steels although all steel is an alloy
by common consent we con sider steel almost as though
it were a chemical element as though it were a
simple substance instead of an alloy of from 2 to
10 constituents when we materially exceed the limits of analy
sis already given or when we add to ordinary steel
other elements not normally present tk nickel chromium vanadium tungsten
molybde num or titanium either w intent or chance the
product ia a special or alloy steel when one of
the normal constituents silicon or manganese is greatly increased in
quantity it becomes ltufficul to decide arbitrarily the percentage at
which we p3ss from a regular carbon steel to an
alloy steel abnormally rais ing the ordinary constituents or adding
other 1 alters the properties of the re sulting alloy
that many useful purposes are served and results not otherwise
obtainable are secured we thus see why the term special
or allo steel has acquired a special signifi cance meaning
any steel to which in adihtton to iron and carbon
and the impurities com mon to all steel other metals
or metalloids have been purposely added to change or im
prove its natural properties chemically pure iron may properly be
classed among the rare metals an ablebodied man would not
be burdened with all the chemically pure iron that was
ever made while the production of commercial iron products more
or less im pure amounts to millions of tons annually
in general it may be said that the influence of
other elements on ironcarbon alloys is 1 the change the
critical points 2 to modify ition in which the carbon
occurs 3 lo remove harmful occluded gaseous impuri ties 4
to combine chemically with the iron or carbon or both
and s either combined or free to form isomorphous solutions
with the iron or to separate into distinct microscopic particles
in uius deporting themselves these other elements are found to
improve or injure the steel to make it harder or
stronger more ductile or more brittle a better magnet or
a better tool a better shaft or a better gear
the effect of these additions has been the subject of
long and careful study but the exact roan ner in
which the added elements influence the ironcarbon sjstem so as
to produce new and useful properties in steel is not
so well under stood these deeper questions are being studied
by a host of able investigators and every day new
truths are discovered which it is hoped will soon form
a basis for rational and intelli gent experimentation in revealing
the hidden possibilities of the iron allosra notwithstanding its complexity
steel and its alloys probably exemplify the general laws of
physical chemistry which have been found to nold good for
simpler and urer alloys these laws beiig the laws of
solution thus roberts austen and spring found that one metal
dif fuses into another like a salt into water in
feneral solubility increases with the temperature letals and alloys will
flow under pressure under 200000 pounds pressure the writer ob
tained from a 3 so per cent nickel steel cylinder
two inches high by one inch in diameter a shortening
of over 50 per cent the new top and bottom
diameters bdng one and a quarter inches while the centre
bulged to over one and a half inches diameter and
there were no signs of cracking under this great pressure
alloys may or may not react chemically when brought into
intimate association by fusion or pressure the molecular mobility increases
with the tem perature upon cooling of molten alloys phenomena
strongly suggestive of freezing salt solutions are observed the depression
ol the freezing point of a metal when another is
added to it follows the laws of coppet and raoult
for dilute solutions and finally the phase rule of gibb
applies quite as well to the explanation of conditions of
equilibrium in alloys as to similar problems in regard lo
liquid solutions benedicks work on electrical conductivity of steels shows
the chemical equivalence of the atoms of different elements dissolved
in irou dgt google u steel special os allov in
increasing tile resistance and in one par ticular instance that
oi ntolylgtdenuiii and tungsien steels long practical experience has shown
that these metals are effective in about the proportion of
their atomic weights that is one part of molybdenum is
about equal to two parts of tungsten in self hardening
and high speed steels and the writer has fully demon
strated that the same relation holds as regards the magnetic
qualities of hardened molybdenum and tungsten steels the chemical coaatitntion
of steel auoys a number of important researches have been
published which throw lit upon the chemical behavior of the
elements in steel and of the chemical compounds which steel
contains iron and carbon are known to com bine at
least in one combination fampc and many other carbides of
doubtful existence have been mentioned from time to time manganese
seems to form an isomorphous solution with iron and lowers
the critical points when over 12 per cent manganese is
present the tempera ture of transformation known as ati is
below t c manganese prevents the separation of graphite and
thus raises the saturation point of iron for carbon in
its direct chemical affini ties it seems to unite readily
with several ele ments it forms a carbide mnic analogous
to cementite and it unites with phosphorus giving a phosphide
miup manganese forms a double cartnde of iron and manganese
as well as exists dissolved in the iron it further
exists in the presence of sulphur as mns it lowers
the critical points very markedly copper dissolves in large quantities
in iron without the forma tion of any compounds arsenic
exists free in steel and according to stead exerts no
bad effect upon structural steel in amounts below 015 per
cent in hardened steel the arsenide of iron occurs phosphorus
unites also with iron to form the phosphide fep in
the presence of high manganese however it is the phosphide
mntpi which results not all of the phosphorus is combined
in these forms but seems to exist in an evenly
disseminated condition through the steel and is liberated as hydrogen
phosphide when the steel is dissolved in weak acids phosphorus
tends to enlai grain siie which tendency partly explains the
embrittling effect by making steels cold short sulphur exists in
steel as the sulphide of man ganese mns and if
there is not sufficient manganese present to use up all
the sulphur the excess exists as a sulphide of iron
fes this fes is extremely harmful as it has a
tendency to envelop the grains of pearlite and the wellknown
red shortness is due probably to the low melting point
of the compound fes a double sulphide of iron and
manganese has been reported phosphorus and sulphur are the two
most harmful impurities in steel and when these impurities segregate
on casting the useful properties of the metal are sometimes
utterly destroyed under the microscope a metal suffering from this
segregation is gen erally found to contain bands of varying
widths and lengths technically known as ghost unes in which
the presence of abnormally large amounts of mns and phosphorus
compounds can generally be detected by the ordinary metallographic tests
chromium occurs both dissolved in the main mass of iron
but chiefly in the form of double carlndes chromitmi his
no direct effect on the critical points but changes the
position of these points as the tempera ture from which
the material is cooled varies silicon in ordinary amounts is
wholly dis solved in the iron it is probable however
that it is not held in solution as elemental sili
con but rather as a silicide of iron fesi it
cannot be seen under the microscope silicon is noted for
the ease with which it precipitzies carbon in the form
of graphite giimuch hu shown that the second maetic transition
poini is steadily lowered with increased silicon con tent until
it reaches a value of about 660 c for 83s
per cent silicon while the first pearl itic point steadily
rises the two coinciding at 22 per cent silicon and
becomes practicalljr extinct at 2s per cent in an exhaustive
study charpy and cornuthenard later confirmed this observation and definitely
connected the dis appearance of the a point with the
precipila lion of graphite tunten appears to raise rather than
lower the cntical points this point however varies too according
to the tempera ture from which the material cools it
fotms a double carbide with iron steel containing 5 per
cent tungsten and more can readily be detected b the
peculiar characteristic dull red spark which is thrown off when
a specimen containing at least this amount is touched to
an emery wheel nickel dissolves in iron in all proportions
nickel retards carburimtion and also tends when the carbon content
is high to precipitate carbon in the form of graphite
nickel lowers the critical points espe ciallj ar when 25
per cent of nickel is present this phenomenon it is
intereslii to note the microscopical researches of guillet who ex
perimented with three series of alloys contain ing respectively 012
per cent 035 per cent and 08s per cent carbon
the nickel increasing by steps of 2s per cent up
to 30 per cent the etching was done by alcoholic
picric acid guil let found that as the nickel increased
pearlile was replaced by martensile and this in turn by
polyhedral crystals indicative of gammairon guillets results upon the micro
structure of nickel steels in general show that mild steels
up to 10 per cent ni are like plain carboa
steel between 10 to is per cent ni there is
a hardening effect from 15 to 25 per cent ni
they are very hard because chiefly composed of niartensite beyond
this amount of nickel they again become soft because martensite
is replaced by gammairon the higher the car bon the
less nickel is required to produce these structural changes holjibdeimm
there has been considerame discussion as to the probable state

and dr uai bcws obssrved independently and at alxtut the
same time that there was a connection be i we
en the resistance offered by steel wires to electric conduction
and the atomic weight of the ele ments present in
the iron this again calls at tention to the close
relation existing between al loys and ordinary solutions professor barretts
paier points out a relation between incread resistivity and the
specific heat of the added elemenl but when we recall
that specific heat x atomic weight a constant we see
that the increased resistivity is as closely connected with the
atomic weight as with specific heat in studying the relation
of electrical re sistance to the constitution of the conducting
alloys the complex character of steel must be kept m
mind it has already been pointed out that steel contains
carbon manganese silicon sulphur and phosphorus that the iron may
exist in two or three modifications and that carbon may
also exist in a variety of ways the limits of
solubility of various elements in iron or of two metals
with carbon forming a double carbide have been but imperfectly
worked out yet notwithstanding these com eications a broad view
of ccfsting evidence ads to the belief that the atomic
law is in some way connected with the problem benedicks
at the university of upsala has brought forth concloaive evidence
that for small concentrations the increase in resistivitj of steel
is a function of the atomic weight ie equi atomic
solutions of metallic elements in iron produce equal increase in
electrical resistance benedicks determined the electrical resistance of a number
of samples of steel which had been carefully analyzed they
contained vary ing quantities of carbon silicon manganese sulphur and
phospbortis the last two elements being fairly low and uniform
the steels were tested in both the hardened and annealed
state prom his determinations he found that 1 atomic per
cent of various elements dissolved in iron produces an increase
in resistance which is equal to 59 microhms per centimeter
cubed he also calculated that the resistance of ab solutely
pore iron would be 76 nricrahms per centimeter cubed but
this value is lower than has ever been obtained experimentally
for gsrfectly pure iron has not been investigated j means
of a formula it was found possible to calculate the
resistance of steel with con siderable accuracy when its analysis
was known in order to apply the formula it was
necessary to ascertain the effect of carbon itself upon the
conductivity this benedicks has done very sfcilfulty in annealed steel
the carbon for the most part exists in separate panicles
of ccmentite fe when euteetoid steel is heated to a
tnperature above 720 c and suddenly on u 3s cooled
ttub eementite disappears and the strtic tare known as martensite
results the carbon of martensite may be combined or simply
dis solved without gombinalion however when hardened steel is reheated
and sktwiy cooled cemectite again appears accompanied by ferrit tins
ferrilc has usually been cwiudered to be pun iron and

dicks shows that ferrite is not free from car bon
but t annealed steels containing from 040 per cent to
170 per cent carbon consists of eementite and iron which
contain about 027 per cent dissolved or hardening carbon ac
cording to benedicks the carbon segregated in the free eementite
exerts little influeooe ujn the conduotivity l chatelier however gives
the resistance of ferrite as 95 and cunentite as 45

aa barrett has mentidned knowing the carbon can tents of
a piece of steal its relative content oi other elements
may be judged by determining its conductiviey benedicks work makes
it possible to judge the electrical quality of dif ferent
samples of iron by a study of tneipcobgt position without
testing them at all barrett has also called attention to
the fact that phyd cal hardness has nothing to do
with hi re sistivity lliat is for equal percentages of
im purities hard tungsten and manganese steels conduct better than
soft alumimun and silicon steels the opoosite is true of
the magnetic prcqiertiessort steels are magnetically soft ie hily permeable
while hard steels are magnetically bard of low permeabihty and
greater retentiveness high spmd steeu a great variety of steels
of the class known as self or ajrhardetv ii have
been put upon the nuricet within tbe past few years
these steeb are idloys of tmgsten or molybdenum and mannese
or chromium they are capable of doing from 100 to
300 per cent more work in macbimss than can be
done by tempered carbon steel and hence tbe above name
has been applied their greatest use is in making roughing
cuts either in the lathe or planer for fine finishing
cuts they arc not equal to the best tempered tools
hardened highcarbon steel for metal working has its ouqmt limited
by the fact that in re moving chips from the
piece being machined most of die work is transformed into
heat at the point of the tool which coasequently loses
its temper at diat point under normal work ing conditions
the heat generated at the tool point is conducted and
radiated away to such an extent that the temperature is
maintained uniform and proportional to the speed of the cutting
the output of a tool depends upon its strength and
upon the heat that ifcao endure d google 8tbbl special
or allott without losing lemper for a plain carbon steel
the temperature acquired in work must not rise higher than
the temperature at which the tool was tempered after hardening
drcadtiout rex aa novo musbet and many other steels are
now made which will hold a cuttine edge at a
temperature more than twice as high as any plain carbon
steel and this means that the speed of lathes for
roughing cuts can be increased from two to five times
the usual limit thatl ner recommends very hirh speed with
limited depth of cut rather than a very deep cut
and low speed the former condition is the more economical
the adoption of highspeed steels in targe shops has revolutionized
this kind of work and has necessitated the installation of
more power and heavier machinery for roughing cuts such as
axle turning a man can triple the output per day
formerly expected of him highspeed steels are used also in
wood turn ing and with the same good results a
speed of 300 feet per minute has been attained working
upon mildsteel forgings of course with harder steel or cast
iron the speed is much less and 300 feet is
unusually good upon any sort of material the number of
steels now on the market all of which lay claim
to the possession of properties suiting them to highspeed work
is very large they are not all of equal merit
but at the same time it is an interesting study
to compare the analysis of these steels and to see
in how many different ways different makers seem to accomplish
their ends their compositions are nearly as numerous and as
different aa diose of bearing or socalled anti friction metals
analysis of these cannot be given here but we may
state some of the limits met with in actual experience
or covered by patents carbon 03 to 2 per cent
tungsten to 25 per cent silicon 025 to 3 per
cent chromium to 7 per cent molybdenum to 15 per
cent manganese trace to 39 per cent vanadium to 250
per cent sulphur and phosirtis al ways low usually three
of these elements are present in quantities which show them
to have been intentionally added edwards and kikkawa have recently
shown that the hardness of properly hardened hi speed steel
decreases slightly and successively on hawing the temper up to
700 or 800 f on drawing still further the hardness
begins to increase until a maximum hardness is readied in
the neighborhood of 1100 f and this hard ness is
greater than the original quenched and imdrawn steel when drawn
at temperatures above 1100 f the hardness falls oft rapidly
this in a measure explains wh the nose of a
cutting tool retains its hardness and cutting efficiency even when
the nose is cutting at a rate sufficient to generate
enou heat to bring it up to 1000 1100 f
special propertks of soma steel alloya the alloys with some
of the rarer metals will now be mentioned so far
as reliable information concerning them is to be had and
recent scien tific work upon alloys which has been pro
ductive of practical results will be briefly con sidered trie
advent of the automobile and aeroplane has placed a demand
on the modern sleel manufacturer for special steels and alloys
which all combine the greatest strength con sistent with the
maximum toughness ma terials of coustructitki have been developed dur
ing the last decade which have virtually revolu tioned the
higrade steel industry axles driveshafts crankshafts gears pinions and engine
parts have been designed with the new special steels cutting

special steels are in most instances devekgtped through the medium

steel vanadium is now used commercially in three general types
of special steels first as an addition to the ordinary
tool steel in amounts up to about 3 per cent
second as an addition to the more modem highspeed steels
and third as a supplement to other alloys in such
steels as chrome vanadium and chromenickel vanadium vanadium imparts to
steel an in creased tensile strength and elastic limit and
when annealed improves the ductility greatly silicon has proved itself
to be an advanta geous addition to steel for a
variety of purposes casper and oertel have patented in gcrmao
a chromesilicon steel the silicon bein greater less or equal
in quantity to the chromium the claim for these alloys
is that they have very high elastic limits and tensile
strengths but at the same time ahow 5 per cent
elongation and 23 per cent reduction in area when hard
ened and tempered the are said to be excep has
a relatively weak effect upon the stren and ductility of
steel it aids tbe machining properties and also improves the
edgeholding properties of tool steel when high in amount it
becomes injurious to annealed steel because it tends to cause
a separation of graphite as may be noticed from the
dark ap pearance of the fracture recently as high as
3 per cent silicon has been observed in certain highspeed
steels and jacob holcer and com pany unieux patented many
years ago a spring steel of the following composition si
18 to 22 per cent c 035 to 045 per
cent mn 045 to 055 per cent this steel is
hardened at the unusually high temperatures of between 900 and
1000 c dy google stbio zvbcim or alloy from itgt
low atomic weigbl it is seen that its effect upon
the electric condactivity of steel is very greal it raises
the resistivity of mild steeu about 100 micixdims per cubic
centi meter for each per cent added so that a
silicon steel containing 45 per cent silicon has a re
sistivity of 59 microhms per cubic centimeter from the work
of gumlich yensen and ruder it has been foand that
the first effect of silicon is to act aa a
deoxidizer its presence in small quantities indicbtin its excess over
the amount of removable oxygen originally present and therefore explains
the first peek in the per meabili curve and depression
in hysteresis value from this point on to about 2
per cent the silicon merely acts as a diluent causing
a steady drop in saturation value and permeabil i and
an increase in coercive force at about 2 per cent
however its influence as a grain growth stimulator becomes evident
and there is a consequent rise in permeamiity and decrease
in coercive force this effect reaches a maxi mum and
from this point onward any added siucon again acts as
a mere diluent this ef fect of silicon upon the
permeability is of vast commerdal importance and many of the
most magnetically permeable steels arc silicon alloys something over 100000
tons of silicoa alloy sheets were used in the united
states alone during 191amp nickel steels melt at a lower
heat than the corresponding carbon steels diere is less segre

tendency to form blowholes nidcelsieel forg ings though tough are
not difficult to machine from 3 to 3j per cent
ni in a 025 per cent c steel gives a
tensile streih and elastic limit equal to a 05 per
cent c steel but still retains 25 per cent elongation
guillaume has discovered that the 36 per cent nickel alloy
expands when heated only 0000001 millimeter per r c or
only hietweifth as much as pure iron this property has
suggested its use in pendulums measuring rods chronometers etc and
its noncorrosive nature makes it still more value for such
uses theodolites leveling instruments and other ap mratus of tile
united slates coast and geodetic survey are to be made
of this alloy another very important application of nickel steels
it sdsted bgt the anomalous expansibility of tills alloy by
adding either iron or nickel to it alloys of almost
any degree of expansibility result char and grenel have shown
that an alloy containing 361 per cent ni 039 per
cent c and 039 per cent mn not only has
an ex tremely low coefficient of expansion but that it
is practically constant between 15 and 200 c manganese steel
is in some respects analo us to nickel steel it
seems to retain the iron in the gamma condition and
to form isomot phous solutions with the iron when present
in sian titles beyond those needed to combine with e
sulphur and phosphorus of the steel nickel 25 per cent
gives an alloy which is practi cally nonmagnetic but when
cooled strongly becomes powerfully magnetic and remains so when warmed
up to the normal temperature hadfields manganese steel containing 13
per cent manganese and 1 per cent carbon is but
slighllv magnetic and the amount is nearly con stant for
strong or weak magnetic fields there is no appreciable residual
magnetism it may not perhaps be considered remark able that
mangancst a nonmaetic metal should destroy the magnetic quahlies of
iron when alloyed with it to the extent of 12
or 13 per cent but surely it is quite unexpected
to find a mckel steel of 25 per cent ni
almost nonmnetic since iron mckel and cobalt arc the only
stroiwly magnetic metals nonmag netic alloys of magnetic metals while
hardly to be expected are not more remarkable than tbc

extensive experiments as an addition to highspeed steels arc heing
carried on but without much prom ise of success it
oxidizes readily and the oxide is so heavy that it

detrimental in such steels uolybdenum steels were one of the

syracuse n y steel testing op steel is tested for
the purpose of determining its qualifications for the use for
which it is designed the test may not be simply
as to its strength but also to obtain a tneasure
of several other important qualities such as malleability ductility and
hard ness which gives it the first rank as a
material for structural purposes of the three usual tests tensile
compressive and transverse or bend ing see testing machines the
tensile test gives the simplest and most accurate data from
which those properties of steel most important in structural work
may be most readily deter mined a heat of steel
is usually submitted to two tensile tests thetieat test in
which the metal is pulled apart to determine if it
is free from red shortness and the cold test in
which the metal in a cold state is bent over
rn itself to discover if it be free from cold
rtness or brittlcness at the mill the speci men to
be tested is prepared so as to indicate the general
properties of the metal and itssnit atality to the puipose
for which it it required and upon the resulting data
is based the treat ment of the metal during the
suhsequenl oimr ations in the mill and at the forge
in selecting the specimen great care is taken to secure
one that is an average of the heat so as
to obtain uniform results as nearly as possible from the
operations of heating rolling forging and coal ing very often
apparently inconsequential dif ferences in the methods employed to select
and prepare the test specimen give very mislead ing if
not absolutely erroneous information specimens rolled from very hot steel
are much weaker softer and more ductile than those rolled

near the middle is divided by light scratches or b
centrepunch marks at intervals of an inch from which the
deduction in the area of the crosssec tion and the
amount of stretch under the pull of the load applied
is measured the tests are made in a machine in
which the pull is exerted by a hydraulic ram and
against the resistance of the very short arm of a
lever upon the long arm of which the pull is
measured in the testing machine the effect produced on the
specimen dy the gradually increased load varies greatly for different
qualities of metal steel containing a large amount of carbon
of the quality generally used for the manufacture of springs
stretches slitly and uniformly up to the brraking point in
the case of softer steel at the beginning as the
load is gradually in creased the metal stretches uniformly for
a little while but the period is much shorter than
tliat of high carbon harder steel then it stretches very
rapidlj for a few seconds with out any appreciable increase
of the load until it is apparently on the point
of breaking when it partially recovers its strength and stretchej
slightly but uniformly as the load is gradually increased to
the maximum in the case of hard steel the metal
ruptures under the maximum load but the soft steel continues
to stretch for a little while beyond that point under
a decreas ing load with a great rednction in the
sectional area of the specimen to determine the amount of
elongation produced by ttie test the frac tured ends of
the two pieces of the broken bar are put together
and the increase in the lengths of the original inch
spaces marked on the bar are measured in very hard
steel the amount of elongation is very small but even
the hard est and most brittle varieties undergo a meas
urable change of length in soft steel it is very
great varyma from 25 to 30 per cent of the
original lengui the behavior of a specimen in the testing
machine when subjected to a gradu ally increasing load is
studied by means of a stressstrain diagram which consists of
two sets of parallel lines intersecting each other at right
angles the horizontal lines represent me strains in pounds per
square inch of the sec tional area of the specimen
aild the vertical lines represent the amount of elongation of
the ig v google stbel testing of 607 the rate
of 001 per inch of the original length wlicn the
data obtained by the test are plotted upon the diagram
the behavior of the specimen is indicated by a characteristic
curve assuming an original length of six inches between the
grips of the machine for a specimen the behavior of
soft steel under a gradually increasing load may be briefly
sum marized as follows up to a load of 40000
poimds to the square inch th elonkation is very slight
about 003 of an inch in a length of six
inches from 40000 to 43000 pounds the elongation is more
rpii but the total amount is only 002 of an
inch prom this point the metal stretches very rapidly with
no increase of load until the elongation amounts to ois
of an inch then it apparently regains some of its
strength and stretches slowly and uniformly until the elongation amounts
to 1 inch or 33 per cent of the original
lengui under a maxi mum load of 63000 pounds to
the square inch an analysis of these results shows that
it would require a load greater than 40000 pounds per
square inch to induce a permanent set in the metal
and is therefore the value representing it elastic limi t
or the limiting stress below which there is practically no
change in the original length of the metal no matter
bow often that stress may be applied or removed it
is generally assumed that a constant pro portion exists between
stresses and strains this relatiod is expressed by the term
limit of proportionality and represents the limit be low which
each increase of a given amount in the load results
in the same change in the length of the specimen
it agrees vety closely with the elastic limit bat it
is not considered an imrtant factor in engineering calculations while
on the other hand the coemdeni or mod ulus of
elasticity based upon the theory of the proportionality between stresses
and strains and obtained by dividing the stress on each
unit of area of the section by the resultant strain
in each unit of length of a specimen is extensively
used in calculations pertaining to the defleclioa of beams and
springs the coefficient of elas ticity for all grades of
steel is practically the same about 29000000 and very delicate
meas urements are required for its determination so much so
that the values obtained by ibfierent observers vary considerably and
places its exact value very much in doubt for similar
reasons the determination of the exact value of the elas
tic limit of a metal is a very difficult matter
and as a rule the values stated as the elastic
limit in the reports of tests of spedmens sent out
from rollii mills is really the yield point of the
metal or the point at miich the specimen suddenly elongates
withont any increase of the load and akhough it is
not theoretically as cor rect a gauge of the property
of the metal as the true elastic limit it is
really a more re liable guide to the manufacturer and
user od account of the ease and accuracy with which
it is determined by simple practical methods and the fact
that in good engineering practice structures are not intemionally designed
to sus tain a stress as high as the true
elastic limit relative to the ultimate or breaking strength of
the metal the tests show that the speci men continues
to elongate under a decreas ing load after the maximum
load has been applied so that owing to the reduced
sectional area the stress under which the specimen finally breaks
is generally much less than the maxi mum and represents
the tenacity rather than the ultimate breaking strength of the
metal high elongation indicates a metal of good mal leable
and ductile quality and if produced under a cold test
shows that the metal is especially suitable for boiler plate
rivets etc another element considered in the tensile test is
the character and appearance of the fracture it often takes
a form described as cup or half ctrp in which
one of the ends is wholly or in part concave
while the other is correspondingly convex in other cases espetially
with flat bars the fractured ends are quite flat and
smooth but with their surfaces making an angle of 45
degrees with the length of the bar insteatl of a
right angle as in the case of die former id
hard steel the surfaces present a rough crystalline appearance while
in soft steel they have the glossy apigtearance of woven
silk or bundles of fine silk ebres although the char
acter of the fracture is always noted in connec tion
with the other data derived from the test it is
seldom made an important requirement in specifications owing to the
impassibility of de termining a fixed standard of comparison compression
tests are made by the same ma chine in slightly
different arrangement so that the hydraulic power is pressure instead
of pull cold bending tests are useful for tbe pur
pose of dcternuning the ability of steel or any other
metal to withstand severe distortion when the metal is cold
under such operations as punching shearing flanging and riveting usu
ally employed in the manufacture of bridge members and structural
shapes in general the test does not require an expensive
or elaborate plant for its application and is therefore avail
able where more complete tests are impracti cable on the
other hand however it is very difficnit to deduce accurate
conclusions from the ltta obtained owing to a lack of
proper clas sification and standards of comparison in making the
test the metal in each case is bent over upon
itself tiirotigh an angle of is degrees the inner radius
of the bend varies from 0 in steel with a
tenacity less than 62000 pounds per square inch to he
thickness of the specimen in steel with a tenacity notgrealer
than 70000 pounds per square inch the specimen is re
quired to stand the bending without fracturing on the outside
of the bend the test for hard ness is applied
by pressing or driving a hard ened steel ball into
the material so as to pro duce a dent the
diameter of the hall used is commonly 10 millimeters and
die standard pres sure used is 3000 kilograms the diameter
of the indentation is then measured two in dentations are
usually made not far apart on the specimen being tested
the formula ap plied is 16 pd 1 this giving
the hard ltmt 10718 ncss number in the brinell scale
it has been objected to these ball tests diat the
tendency of the pressure is to raise up a cupshaped
rim of steel around the ball and above the level
of the test specimen and that the diameter meas ured
will thus be of the raised cup to obviate this
a delicate instrument has been devised to measure the depth
of the indentation below the level of the tested surface
and from this to google stbbl theories op hardbnino calculate
the true diameter another method of applng this ball test
is by a falhng ham mer which carries the ball
upon its face the standard weight of the hammer is
176 kilo grams and the drop may be any distance
up to 90 centimeters several tests are made at different
falls and the results correlated a variation of this test
substitutes a coneshaped point with an angle of 90 degrees
for the spherical ball this also is applied by a
stand ard pressure or by the falling hammer and a
closer accuracy is claimed as determined by these methods the

testing steel of great accuracy in the hands of an
expert is the spark test this is applied by pressing
the sample of steel for an instant hrmly against a
sharp emery wheel revolving 7000 feet per minute to the
educated eye the kind of sparks emitted indicate with great
certainty not only the proportion of carbon in the sample
but the several alloys with tungsten manganese or chromium other
tests are made for endurance of steel samples especially that
used in the automobile industry such steels are tested for
fatigue being subjected again and again times without munber to
the same kind of strain and also to shocks which
they must safely withstand in the ordinary use of a
car these tests are ap slied by automatic machines acting
unceasingly dr many hours another test of great import ance
in automobile steel is the abrasion test for wear in
some cases toruonal and shearing tests are made but these
stresses are not commonly expected the impact test is more
often em ployed applied by means of a heavy swinging
pendulum or by an oftrepeated drop of a weight upon
a irar supported at the ends the tests of finished
steel are similar to those made in the mills during
the process of manufacture with the exception of the methods
employed in the preparation of the test specimens these are
cut directly from the finished product in the form of
rectangular pieces 10 inches in length in the larger kinds
of work while small bars are generally tested full size

constituent found in normally hardened steels the ques tion what
is martensite cannot be answered quite conclusively particularly as several
rival views are in the field in the ustial practice
followed in hardening a piece of ordinari carbon steel the
operation is an extremely simple one it consists of heating
the piece to a predetermined tempera ture holding at this
temperature for a length of time sufficient for the entire
mass to be evenly heated and then suddenly coolinf it
the cooling is usually done by immerung in a liquid
usually water or oil the simplest steel has at least
two constitu ents one iron or ferrite and the other
a carbide of iron or cementite and in order to
gain an inkling of what transpires it is necessary to
study the properties of these two constituents if we plot
a cooling curve of pure iron we find that at

it is in the beta condition and above 898 c
it exists in the gamma condition in each of these
three conditions the physical properties are entirely distinct crystallographically they
are all of the cubic system but the gamma iron
assumes the dctahedra while the beta and alpha assume the
cube twin crystals are frequent in the gamma but the
beta and alnha are free from ihem alpha iron is
magnetic and the change from alpha lo beta is accompanied

the carbon in steel exists in the form of a

some readers but under certain con ditions this is ime
as ah example gold and silver are mutually soluble in

that tbe hardness of steel is due to the presence
of beta iron the followers of this theory be lieve
that on heating the cementite dissolves in the gamma iron

and prevents it from entirely reverting to the alpha iron
were it possible to obtain beta iron by means other
than the solution of the cementite the material would still
be hard the allotropists are also of the opinion that
in the trans formation from the gamma to tne beta
the internal pressure may contribute to the final hardness lab
the alpha iron theory denies the presence of beta iron
entirely and explains that the hardness is due to the
fact that on cooling the gamma iron with the cementite
in solution changes directly to the alpha form which latter
still retains the cementite in solution this theory has little
or no standing since the careful and thorough experiments of

an intrinsically hard but unstable product amorphous iron the gamma
iron crystals iji passing through the transition temperature break up
leaving the molecules temporarily in a chaotic amorphous con dition
pending iheir reorganization into crystals of alpha iron and cementite
and it is only this rearrangement which is stopped by
the rapidity of cooling rosenhain believes fur ther thai the
breakdown of the gamma crystals occurs only around the boundaries
of the grow ing crystals of alpha iron ic the
carbon theories claim that the hardness is due to the

the early stress theory when steel is heated to its
critical range it expands at a rate which is approximately
directly propor tional to the temperature change on passing through

modesk meihops df steel car industry the the building of
steel railroad cars is recognized as one of the most
prominent of our industries european countries were pioneers in uie
use of iron cars and as earl as 1861 we
find records of cars with iron bodies being built in
france while in india iron was substituted lot wood at
an early dale as the latter material was par licularily
susceptible to the attacks of ants and odter insects which
condition necessitated the use or iron or steel in the
construction of equip ment for use on the railroads of
that country in other foreign countries the selection of iron
for this purpose was undoubtedly governed largely by the comparative
cost of iron and wood which in many instances favored
the use of the former material and also for the
reason that climatic conditions in many of these countries are
such that wooden cars rapidly dis integrated to the american
engineer how ever shouldbe given the credit of foreseeing the
possibilities of steel in cai confitmclion not solely from a
constructive standpoint but as a scientific solution of the problem
of economical transportation the successful operation of a railway is
dependent on the relative cost of transportation and the use
of steel in car coo strtiction has made it passible
to decrease to the minimum die percentage of dead weit
lo that of paying load the progress made in the
proper aireciabon of the stresses to which the different parts
of a car are subjected has re sulted in great
improvements providing ample strength for the duties imposed on the
several parts eliminating superfluous material where it may be done
wioiout detriment to the car as a d google stbbl
cab hgtu8trt am whole thus producing in steel cars of
mimnium weight and mbximum strength this favorable contpaiison of percentage
of dead weight to paying load la much more evident
ui the higher capacity cars where the full benefit of
the dif ference in strength between wood and metal may
be realised the capacity of freijt cars in this countrj
has been continuauy on the increase and con stant efiotta
are being made to redtice the rela tive proportion between
weight of car and weight of lading up to 1876
the average iteigbt car had a carrying capacity of 2000lgt
pounds while the ratio of paying load to total weight
of car and lading was about 47 per cent in
1880 the capacity had been increased to 40000 pounds and
the ratio of paying load to 60 per cent in
1883 to 50000 pounds and 65 per cent in 1889
to 60000 pounds and 66 per cent in 1895 to
80000 pounds and 68 per cent and in 1903 to
100000 to 110000 pounds and 75 to 79 per cent
respectively in the catalogue of allsteei cars manufac tured in
1918 the largest load capacity is that of the 120ton
pmidola car it is 50 feet in length 9 feet
8 inches in width and with waljs 7 feet 4
inches high above the floor level this car weighs about
74000 pounds and with its full load represents a total
weit of 314000 pounds the paying load approjumately 77 per

in weight from 43100 pounds to 52600 pounds it ranges

and from 8 feet 4 inches to 9 feet 2

the heavier car a paying load of about 66 per
cent hopper cars for coal carry 100 ions upon a
car weight of 60000 pounds to 75300 pounds the paying
load thus ranging from 77 to 73 per cent of
the total rolling weight the 100lon flat car and the
110ton wellhole car weighing respectively 90000 pounds and 92000 pounds
have still lower paying efficiency however when durability is considered
rfie heavy cars are more economical in the long run
and with thdr far greater burden serve to roll up
the record of tonmiles with far greater rapidity than the
tight car of smaller burden the modem allsteel passenger coaches
range in weight from 116000 to 146000 pounds and the
dinmgcars the heaviest of all standard coaches reach 175000 pounds
the general introduction of the steel car was not accomplished
without serious opposi tion first from those who were directly
in terested in the manufacture of wooden cars and second
from those who were skeptical as to the advisability of
adopting steel as a vehicle of transportation citposcd to the
action of in jurious elements which might cause a rapid
de terioration of the metal and a consequent reduction in
stren however up to the 1 be r 1 the
c s effects from this h proper attention is given
to the method of struction and weight of metal used
and all parts are thoroughly painted at the time of
manufacture to protect them from corrosion and if after the
cars are placed in service care is taken to repaint
them when necessary it is fair to presume judgins from
the present con dition of the earher steel cars built
in this country that we ma reasonably expect an average
length of service from the steel car of at least
30 years or fully twice as long as the service
obtamed from cars of wood construction the steel car industry
may be correctly said to date its origin in this
country from the year 1896 although the records of the
patent ofampce show that patents were granted to citizens of
this country as well as of foreign countries for cars
made entirely of steel or other metal as early as
18s4 and it is also true that prior to this
time cars of metal or a combination of metal and
wood had been constructed and put in service in this
country but these early ef forts had httle in common
with the modem steel car now standard on many of
our leading railways previous to the year 1897 many cars
had been constructed in this country of steel or iron
but were built for special service by the several railroads
mainly for the purpose of facilitating the transportation of heavy
ma tcrials where the load was more or less con
centrated such as wire cables guns bridge gird ers etc
in the design of such special equip ment no particular
attention was given to the consideration of a reduction of
the weight of the component parts widi the result that
most of these earlier metal cars were excessively heavy and
not suitable for general s ohio railroad and weighed 18000
pounds with a capacity of 30000 pounds later in 1869
the lake shore and michigan southern railroad placed in service
flat cars with iron channel sills and the new york
central and hudson river railroad had several metal cars run
ning on its road as early as 1s73 in these
cars fhe substitution of iron for wood was more particularly
confined to the under framing of the c3f the superstructure
if any being of wood in connection with uiese early
types of metal underframes mention may also be made of
steel underframes for carrying water tanks of locomotives which were
in use as early as 1881 it was not until
1887 however that metal undcrframe cars were placed in service
in any considerable numbers these being built under patents owned
by the southern iron car com pany who constructed several
thousand steel under frame freight cars including box cars hopper
bottom gondola cars flat cars etc these underframes were of
the iron tubular type being formed by the assemblement of
different sizes of wroughtiron pipe tied to gether by means
of threaded connections so as to form a light and
compact structure how ever in actual service it was found
that the connections would rapidly loosen thus destroy ing the
strength of the whole and after only a comparatively short
time the construction of cars of this type was entirely
abandoned from this time on numerous experimental cars with steel
underframing were built but the unsatis factory results derived from
the tubular under frame undoubtedly retarded the adoption of the
modem type of steel underf rame car the penn sylvania
railroad in 1887 buill a number of cars having steel
underframes which were de signed lo carry a concentrated load
of 120000 d google eo8 steet cas industkt pounds and
a steel fireproof car was built in 1889 at the
shops of the louisville new albany and chicago railroad the
oiicago burlington and quincy railroad about the year 1890 placed
in service a sleel car of 60000 pounds capacity constructed
from designs of the harvey steel car company in 1894
the carnegie steel company ordered from the fox solid pressed
steel equipment company of jolict iii a number of steelflat
cars of 80000 pounds capacity to be used in service
about its mills for the transportation of heavy billets these
were built entirely from pressed steel shapes and embodied in
their de gn special features of pressed steel work be
ing similar in this respect to cars then being built
by the leeds forge company of england both the fox
solid pressed steel equipment company and the leeds forge company
being controlled by sampson fox who was the orig inator
of pressedsteel shapes in car construc tion up to this
time 1894 the possibilities of the use of steel in
car construction it is fair to state were not fully
appreciated by those con trolling the design and operation of
railroad equipment and to the carnegie steel company should be
given the credit for properly placing before the railroad world
the possible advan tages to be derived from the use
of an allsteel car the interest displayed by the carnegie
company was no doubt largely the result of a desire
to increase the demand for its product by providing additional
avenues for the con sumption of steel plates and shapes
the argu ments at the time set forth in favor
of the use of steel for freightcar construction and all
which claims experience has since verified were lightness durability strength
fcreater propor tion of paying load to total weight of
car re duced cost of maintenance less liability to dan
age and greater salvage value to further exploit the possibilities
of steel in car construction the carnegie steel com pany
in 1896 had buih at the keystone bridge works three
altsteel cars one of these being a sleelflat car and
two selfdeariag hopper cars in which the floors are inclined
from the ends downward toward the centre and at the
bot tom of these inclines doors being provided which when
opened permit the load to dis charge by gravity these
cars were exhibited at the conventions of the master car
builders and master mechanics associations held at saratoga in tune
1896 and elicited the interest of car builders and railroad
men throughout the country rolled plates and shapes which could
be purchased in the open market and all of which
constituted the product of the car negie mills were used

coal car built entirely from pressed shapes these being built
under patents issued to c t schoen and j m
hansen the prompt and extended adoption of the allsteel car
is undoubtedly due to the aggressive policy pur sued by
this company and its successor in the introducdon of its
product the designs for these cars were placed before railroad
engineers shortly after the exhibit of the cars built at
the keystone bridge works for the carnegie steel company the
carnee steel cbmpany own ing and operating the pittsburgh bessemer
and lake erie railroad extending from pittsburgh to lake frie
decided to place in service on this road enough cars
to thoroily demon strate die possibilides of cars built of
steel and early in 1897 placed with the schoen pressed
sleel company an order for 600 selfclearing steel hopper cars
of 100000 poimds capatsly it being specified that 400 of
these cars were to be of the structural design originally
prepared by the carnegie companys engineers and 200 to be
of the pressed steel design advocated by c t schoen
at the time of the placing of this order it
may be interesting to note that there was no industrial
establishment in the country specially equipped for the construction of
steel cars and the schoen pressed steel company was not
able to turn out one com plete car per day
upon being awarded this order however those interested in the
schoen pressed steel company of which c t schoen was
the executive head immediately arraied for the extension of its
plant and carried on the work of enlargement simultaneously with
the construction of the cars with the result that the
entire order for 600 cars were com pleted in nine
months the first car having been completed in june 1897
following the order of cars for the pitts burgh bessemer
and lake frie railroad the pittsburgh and western railroad placed
with tbe schoen pressed steel company an order for 450
pressed stee selfclearing hopper cars of 100000 pounds capacity these
two orders marked an epoch in car construction and rl
way freight transportation and the steel car industry was firmly
established and has since grown with phenomenal rapidity as already
stated the cars for the pittsburgh bessemer and lake erie
railroad were of two different designs one employing rolled sections
and the other pressed shapes as both were along radi
cally different lines from previous designs of either wood or
metal cars a general description of both types may prove
of interest the cars designed by the carnegie steel company
were what is known as the hopper bottom me of
car the cubical capaci being about 1400 cubic feet the
centre sills con sisted of two isinch i beams and
the side sdls were 12inch channels with their flanges placed
inward no intermediate sills were used the plates forming tbe
sides of the car extended to the bottom of the
side sill channels and were riveted to the web of
same this latter form of construction was employed on the
first sample car but on later cars was modified by
omitting the channel side sills and riveting an angle along
the lower edge of the side plates a second angle
being riveted to the plates about 18 inches higher up
both angles extending the made up of inclined steel plat
and a crosshood placed at the centre of the car
this car weighed about 37150 pounds the car made of
pressed steel was similar in general appearance to the above
described car but differed materially in the details of con
cii v google steel enoraving steel tubiho 608 siniction the
centre jius were made of plate pressed to channel form
beink 1 indm deep u the centre and tapering to
10 inches deep at the bolsters the side sills wre
of similar con struction and the side plates were flanged
at both top and bottom the bottom flanges being riveted
to the top flanges of the side sills the body
bolsters also were of pressed steel bring at about ibe
time the order for the pitts burg bessemer and lake
erie cars was placed tbc pittsburgh and lake erie railroad
was de signing a hopper car along somewhat similar lines
to the cars designed by the carnegie steel company and
a sample car in accordance with these designs was built
by the youngstown bridge company this car being completed and
placed in service about march of 1897 in this car
the centre sills consisted of 15indi i beams the sides
of the car bein builtup plate girders with diagonal reinforang
angles extending from top to bottom and stiltening angles ex
tending the length of the sides being riveted to the
upper and lowvr edges thus forming a girder which was
designed to carry the entire load in order to reduce
the weight of the ear the side sheets below the
floor line from the bolsters to the ends of the
car were cut out this car was of 100000 pounds
capacity and wnghed 35500 pounds no pressed shapes whatsoever wew
used in its construction up to this time all the
cars built by the schoen pressed steel company were of
the hopyer bottom type but the value of steel in
freight car construction having been fully dem onstrated orders for
other types fallowed in rapid succession so that today practically
all forms of freight cars including hoppers flat bottom gondolas
flat and ballast cars have htin constructed from steel in
large numbers the adoption of the idea of maximum train
loads and the consequent enormous increase in the tractive power
of the locomotive served to further increase the popularity of
the steel car as it early becam evident that the
draft rigging and underframe construction of the wooden car would
prove inadequate for the severe service to which they were
subjected as a consequence many cars of the box stock
and gondola types were built with steel under framing and
having a superstructure of wood as a substitute for the
original all wood struc ture cars of this type have
given very satis factory results in service as with the
com bination all the desirable features of the wooden body
are retained while the under irame is sulnciently strong to
resist the most severe buffing and pulling strains a furdier
advance in the substitution of steel in cars of the
combination type has rccentlv been made by fte use of
steel posts braces plates and car lines as a substitute
for those of wood thus producing a complete steel frame
car the successful results obtained from thrj mtroduction of rolled
steel as the basic ma terial in many large engineering
enterprises warranted its careful consideration in the in fancy of
steel car construction and when the carnegie steel company specified
that the major portion of its first order for steel
ears was to he constructed of rolled section it is
ewdent that from the very beginning it was recognized that
the ideal car would be one made throughout of standard
commercial shapes as pressed steel however admitted of the pro
duction of snapes of the exact form desired and the
early development of the steel car beintf in the hands
of those predisposed in favor and interested in the manufacture
of pressed steel parts it is natural that great progress
was first made in the perfecting of this latter type
of construction while the car made of rolled sec tions
remained for the time in its original crude slate being
clumsy and heavy when com pared with the more highly
developed pressed steel car the advantages of constructing a car
from a few standard commercial shapes easily obtained in the
open market especially when considering the question of repairs rather
than from numerous special parts re quiring expensive machinery in
their manufac ture were too manifest however to permit of
being loi ignored and that it was possible to build
cars from standard rolled sections hav ing all the advantages
of light weight and maxi mum strength claimed for the
pressed steel car has been fullv demonstrated by the later
de velopments of the art and is amply evidenced by
the numerous structural steel cars now in service which compare
favorably with the pressed steel typs in the matters of
lightness strenh and simplicity of construction with the increasing demand
for the steel car it is natural that a very
inviting field for the investment of capital was disclosed with
the result that we have today in the united states
a score of large corporations actively en gd in this
line of manufacture the penn sylvania railroad builds its own
steel cars both passenger and freight designs and several other
railroads build freit cars for their own use besides the
very large domestic trade the steel car builders have developed
a profitable and growing export trade which is destitred to
be much larger in the near future as the bel
gium production heretofore the chief com petition in the foreign
markets must necessarily be small for several years to come

and one of the widest used products of steel for
many years steel tubing was not con sidered entirely satisfactory
by manufacturers because the welded parts were not as strong
as the rest of the tubing this difficulty has been
overcome and today steel tubing finds a re markable market
in the manufacturing of auto mobiles engines furniture baby carriages
beds google ot stssl tubing boilers etc steel tubrng is
made from solid or hollow billets or from steel ribbon
technoloxy there are four methods of manufactunng steel tubing ie
lap welding butt welding the piercing method and the lloyd
oxyacctylene method the lap method has been in vogue for
many years dating back to the period when steel first
began to be used the early manner of lap wltlding
was known as spiral welding steel sheets of a desired
width were wound spirally to form a tube the spiral
joints were heated and welded by a hammer although in
many cases these joints were cold riveted an even earlier
method of making steel piping was to take two semicircular
pieces of steel and insert the edges into steel bars
with grooves in either side these were held in place
by pressure applied on all sides there was no welding
or joining of the semidrcular pieces and the piping thus
made was useless except for underground purposes or in such
places where the pressure could be applied at all times
iter came the siraiht lap welding where flat steel of
a desired width was passed through rolls drawn over dies
and formed with the edges overlapping heat was applied and
the overlapping edges were hammered or squeezed together this left
the welded part thicker and stronger than the rest of
the tube and was never satisfactory for good manufac turing
work in a later method the flat steel ribbon was
heated and the edges were scarfed or bevelled by passing
through rolls drawn through dies and so formed that the
scarfed or bevelled edges of the ime side of the
flat steel fitted into the same edges of the other
side this partlymade tubing was then re heated passed through
rolls with the inner lap resting on a stationary mandrel
the rolls and the mandrel pressed the heated steel to
gether and welded il the rough tubing was then passed
through sizing rolls straightened rouca on coohng tables and finally
forcea through straightening machines hy hydraulic pressure butt welding then
came into use the first process requiring that the entire
piece of flat steel be heated to a welding heat
and drawn through a conical shaped die so that square
edges were pressed together then came the brazing process of
butt welding in which a blowtorch like that of a
tinsmith on with far greater heat was used to ccntrauzc
the heat at the square edges where the brazing is
to take place the brazing method is used when very
thin tubing is to be made because the heat of
the blowtorch is not sufficient to make thicker steel tubing
it is largely used in brass or copper weldmg where
a heat of from 1200 to 1400 is required while
steel needs from two and onehalf to several tims that
heat the electric process consisted of heating the edges and
applying pressure so that the steel is pushed together and
welded at the same time flat steel is put through
conical shaped rollers bringing the edges of the steel together
at the point where electric heat is appliei as the
steel is heated the rollers press the edges closer together
this was a decided improvement over other processes of butt
welding but the greater strength and thickness of the welded
part made several other processes of rolling etc necessary before
the tubing was ideal the hercing seamless method is the
latest and most efficient for producing heavy steel tubing solid
or hollow billets are healed to about 2300 and passed
through diagonal rolls traveling at a tremendous speed lliese rolls
work the steel into desired siie while the billet is
passing over the rolls it is pushed against a mandrel
which is stationary but re volving 2400 times per minute
tlic billet is thus worked into a desired size with
a hole through the centre and comes through a tube
after many operations for example if a twoinch tubing 46
inches long is desired a billet three inches round and
26 inches long is heated passed through the diagonal rolls
and at the same time has the mandrel passed through
it when this operation is completed the tubing measures three
and onehalf inches on the outside with a seven sixteenths
shell it is then taken to the round rolls where
it is elongated and the shell reduced then it is
cold drawn hot rolled pickled cold drawn annealed and so
on the lighter the shell de sired the more operations
necessary the piercing method foimd itself vjery applicable to the
hollow steel billet made first in sweden where the molten
steel was poured over a core the latter removed when
the stee shell had cooled thus leaving a round billet
with a rough hole through the centre this made it
possible for the piercing method to come much speedier in
production the lloyd oxyacetylene is the latest method of producing
thm gauge steel tubing until this method was invented thingauge
tubing was exceedingly costly in comparison to larger gauge tubing
owing to the many more treat ments reqniied in order
to get a thinwalled tube the lloyd oxyacctylene method re
quires steel ribbons of desired widths the ribbons are passed
through ovalshaped rollers thus bringing the square edges close together
the partially shaped tubing then passes to other rollers which
press the edges very close to gether at this point
oxyacetylene heat is ap plied at aout 2500 and the
welding takes tlace it is then polished cut off to
desired tngths and comes out of the machine ready for
use a single machine accomplishes the entire work the lloyd
oxyacetyiene method differs from the butt welding in that the
steel edges are not pressed together and only a very
small portion of the partially shaped tubing is heated so
delicate is the operation that a seamless tube is produced
in desired lengths without waste history while the use of
iron and steel has become so common in mechanical and
structural work as a result of modem iicnu ity it
is hard to rcauze that nearly five and onehalf centuries
passed by after the dis covery of iron before steel
4ecame a commer cial product iron was first found say
his torians in the pyramid of gizeh where it had
been placed by builders most likely as a relic this
same iron today rests in the british museum so far
as is knpwn iron was used coramercially for the first
time by assyrians in kprypt they made various kinds of

when s german metallurgist produced them the in ventions of
the bessemer process fo use of steel became an important
prodact in mechanical and manufacturing history very soon after processes
for preparing it were in vented the first known use
of steel as a tube or pipe is the coolgardie
pipeline 328 miles long and 30 inches in diameter this
pipe was not welded it waa formed by taking ribbon
steel and bending into semicircular shape the edges were inserted
into steel bars with grooves on either side heavy pressure
was applied on the plates and bars thus rendering the
pipe serviceable steel tubing itself was one of the veiy
latest uses of steel owing to the early inability to
make welded steel tubing so that the welded portion was
of the same strength as the rest of the lube
later just the op posite condition arose but today the
piercing and lloyd oxyacetylene methods have over come all these
objeaions the early lap and bntt welding methods were not
satisfactory tor highclass work and it was not until mannes
tnan brothers german by birth but residents of landore wales
and backed by british financiers brout out the piercing method
they look round or square steel billets and pierced and
rolled them to the size desired this was a seamless
method in which no weld ing was required and therefore
gave great impetus to steel tubinff uses improvements on the
mannesman method have been made by w c mccool of
beaver falls pa he being the first to invent a
cold draw bench for draw ing cold shafting r c
sleifel made other improvements at ellwood city pa he fol
lowed these with new improvemenls at shelby pa while george
j thust added more at detroit and milwaukee where mills
were built in which the piercing method was used the
great difficulty of the piercing method arose when thingauge tubing
was required for the thinner the uge the more rolling
and drawing required these many operations made the cost of
thingauge tubing almost prohibitive it was not until 1910 that
marshall b lloyd of menominee mich solved the problem of
the thingauge seamless steel tubing high prices long dela and
imperfect thingauee tubing drove mr lloyd into inventing the lloya
oxyacetylene method of making seam less steel tubing by this
method the very thinnest gauge steel tibing is possible the
thin ner the tubing the cheaper the price due to
the fact that under the lloyd method the real cost
of the tubing is the material while in all other
cases the high cost is due to the numerous operations
in which labor plays an important part along with material
georgb w roweix jr steel wire and nail making the
importance of the steel wire and nail in dostry in
the united states may be measured by the fact that
in 1902 there was produced a total of 1574293 tons
of wire rods of which nearly 500000 tons were made
into wire nails in 1909 the production of wire rods
was 2514 5 tons valued at 67440000 the 19l8 out
pot is estimated as 3000000 tons of the value of
100000000 about onefourth of this goes into nails time was
when both wire and nails were manufactured entirely from wrought
iron and to secure the toughness and high tensile strength
reiuired great care had to be used in the preparation
of the iron the cost of the prod uct being
proportionately high it was only a question of time before
steel because of its less cost and its hih strength
became the standard material in this as in other branches
of the iron and steel industry and toda practically the
whole of the wire and wire nails used are made
from either bessemer or openheartb sieel the latter being specified

the great increase in strengdi 61 steel over iron wire
it may be mentioned that while good black iron wire
will show an ultimate tensile strength of about 25 tons

of 35 tons to the square inch bessemer steu wire
win stand a strain of 40 tons and openhearth steel

of caststeel wire made under spedficadons calling for a particular

an ultimate breaking strength of from 150 to 170 tons
to the square inch the process of wiredrawing serves greatly
to improve the phjsical qualities and the smaller the size
to wmch the wire is drawn down the greater is
the ultimate breaking strength the wonderful qualities of piano wire

and wire nails of commerce are manufactured from bes semer
billets openhearth billets are worked up into rods for the
manufacture of chain for special grades of wire and for
various finished products in which high tensile strength is called
for in each rod mill billet continuousheating furnaces arc continually
at work the billets which are 4x4 inches in section
and 36 inches in length are fed transversely into the
furnace side bv side they are pushed through the fur
nace door by a hydraulic charging machine and by the
time they have been heated to the proper google stbbl
wirb ahd nail uakinq temperature for rolling they sxc pushed
one after the other out through the rear door of
the furnace and fall upon a conveyor by which they
are carried down into the rod mill roughin hiu the
roughing mill consists usually of eight pairs of rolls in
which the billet is reduced from a 4inch x 4inch
section to a threefourths inch square section and it is
in this mill that the steel receives the first in
stalment of that thorough mechanical working which contributes so greatly
to its ultimate tensile strength each pair of roju is
placed at an increasing distaace from the one that pre
cedes it in order to allow for the increase in
length due to the decrease of section of the billet
it has been found moreover that by changing the shapes
of the grooves in the sue cessive pairs of rolls
making ihem alternately square and oval oval and round etc
there is not only an economy of power secured hut
a more thorouf worlao or manipulation of the metal is
obtained and its qualities are propor tionately improved in the
dghth set of rolb or pass as it is technically
known the grooves are threequarters of an inch square from
these the last pair of roughing rolls the rods are
carried to the finishing mill finiahing mill in this mill
the wire rods are given common 10 more passes and
brought down to the required dimensions the finishing milt generally
lies at rifjt angles to the roupi ing mill and
instead of the rods passing through pair after pair of
rolls in a continuous straight line they pass throu the
successive rolls in alternating directions describing half circles between each
pair in order to guide the rods into the proper
rolls workmen stand be tween each pair and as the
rod issues from the rolls it is seized with a
pair of tongs bent around through a halfcircle and led
to the next pass consequently when a rod mill is
in full blast it presents one of the most in
teresting sights owing to the rapid decrease in section and
increase in length as the rod passes through the successive
rolls it is neces sary thai the speed of the
successive rolls be increased and by the time the rod
issues from the tenth roll of the finishing mill it
is travel ing at a speed of 1350 feet per
minute or about is miles an hour as the whole
of the rolling down from the 4inch x 4inch billet
to the finished rod which will be say 1364 of
an inch in diameter is done at one heat it
can be understood that the scene is extremely pictur esque
in order to protect the men who stand between the
pairs of rolls and direct the course of the rods
a series of curved semicircular guards or shields are fastened
upon the iron floor of the mill the amount of
working to which the steel is subjected and the great
horse power that is required to perform this duty may
be judged from the fact that the billet winch at
the first pass through the mills was 4 inches x
4 inches in section and only 3 feet long as
it issues from the last pair of rolls is a
scant quarter of an inch in diameter and measures no
less than 1189 feet or not far from a quarter
of a mile in length as the rods leave the
last pair of rolls the ends are caught up and
attached to the drums of a set of reels on
which they are woimd up into a convenient coil for
further handling as soon as the coil is completed it
is dropped from the reel onto the floor of a
conveyor by duch it is carried to the wire mill
wiredrawing up to this point the product is known by
the technical name of rods and it is only after
it has been drawn down in the dies that it
is known commercially as wire wiredrawing has the advantage of
permitting the production of a much smaller wire than could
be produced under the rolls while the very process of
drawing down the wire greatly enhances its phvsical qualities in
creasing the tensile strength lo a truly remark able degree
the wiredrawing maoiine con sists of a stout bench on
whi is mounted a strong castiron drum on which the
wire is wound as it is drawn through the plate
the drawplates or dieolates as thej are called are stout
blocks of cast steel which arc per forated with conical
holes carefully gauged to the exact desired size of the
wire the holes have a slight taper the wire of
course enter ing at the larger end of the hole
tlie coil of wire is placed on a spool located
on the floor of the shop near the bench and
the end of the wire having been s wagged down
b passed through the dieplate and attached to the drum
which then proceeds to wind up the wire until the
whole coil has been drawn down as the wiredrawing is
done cold it can be well under stood that with
several score of these machines running at the same time
it requires very powerful motive power to drive the mill
an increasing quantiq of wire is now drawn to special
shapes other than round some square or flat some of
dsection or with a groove these being adapted to various
mechanical uses after it has been drawn down it is
necessary to remove the strains in the wire and it
is ac cordingly taken to the annealing room where it
is loaded into large annealing pots after the pot is
filled it is carefully sealed with sand to exclude the
air and the wire is exposed to a steady heat
for a period of from eigt to nine hours of
the total produa part is now ready for the open
market without any further treat ment a small portion of
it is sent to the gal vanizing room to be
galvanized and a large proportion of i goes to the

blows a stream of the finished wire nails bens to

iron boxes placed to receive them the wire first passes
between two pairs of horizontal grooved wheels which are pressed
firmlv together to give the required tension to the wire

nail has been formed and cut off the nail is
painted by the action of a pair of pliers with
vshaped cutting edges and the head is formed up by
the action of a very powerful cam operated member which
strikes a hammerlike blow as each nail is finished the

stbllite name applied to a series of alloys conststing essentially
of cobalt and chromium the alloy consisting of cobalt and
chromium only is made by mehing the two melals together
and casting the resulting mix ture into bars if the
chromium does not ex ceed 25 or 30 per cent
these bars may be forged into rods or rolled into
sheets during the cast ing and rolung proccas the alloy
becomes cov ered with a thm film of oxide of
a dark blueblack color when this is ground off however
and the rod or plate is polished it shows a
beautiful lustre which is not dimmed by exposure to any
kind of meial conditions t air and tory in fact
it retains its lustre under all c cumstances and is
only equaled in this respect by gold and the metals
oi the platinum group it may he readily ford into
spoons knives forks etc and uiese articles are so hard
that they can scarcely be scratched by the file the
alloy is stiffer than steel in fact it is the
most rigid alloy in use and while its elastic limit
13 not very nigh it is sufficient for practical pur
poses in almost any form into which it may be
made when a certain amount of tungsten or molybdenum is
added to the alloy the hardness is greatly increased and
some of the alloys thus formed are harder than any
steel ever pro duced these latter are termed tool metal
alloys and when cast into bars need only to be
ground to a cutting edge and placed in the tool
holder of the lathe to render them immediately available results
obtained with these tools in the machinehop are very remarkable
red hot shavings may be cut from steel bars without
injury to the edge of the tool and on certain
kinds of work a machinist is able to turn out
from 2s to 100 iper cent more work in a
day than with the best highspeed steel tools the name
stellite is derived from the latin word stella meaning a
starj because when once polished it always retains its lustre
or brightness stellite alloys have been manufactured into pocket and
table cutlery spoons forks mirrors razors knife edges for bajances
surgical tools dental instruments and machine tools pocket knife blades
made of this metal retain their lustre under all circumstances
and may be used for cutting apples oranges lemons and
various other fruits without marring their lustre in the subtest

more than 350 feet tall and may exceed 20 feet
in diameter stems are very diverse m general habit they
may be erect and unbranched as in most palms erect
and branched as in pine and many other trees scrambling
as in blackberries and rasp herries twining as in morningglory
and hop climbing as in grape and boston ivy creeping
as in dewberry and periwinkle and with many modifications of
these general types they are also definable according to duration
as annual and perennial and according to structure as herbaceous
and woody these are also modified in nature botanists lavor
a classification which deals with the character of foliar organs
borne thus 1 leafbearing stems geaerally most evident since they
bear leaves and consequently aerial and frequently branchedj 2 floweriearing
stems and 3 scaiebeanng stems which bear rather small more
or less leaflike but not green organs and may be
situated above or below the surface of the soil the
last group nins into many modifications such as rhizomes tubers
and bulbs below ground and the buds of trees and
shnrbs above ground they arc also grouped according to their
anatomical structure as described later the functions of stems are
usually to lift the leaves and flowers off the ground
and ex pose them to lit and air or to
act as storage organs in which reserve food is placed
until needed while the epidermis remains green aenal stems can
and do perform the functions of leaves in assimilating food
a very important office in such plants as cacti in

dividing during the growing season forming bark layers externally and
wood layei tnternauy it b also from this layer that
the healing of wounds in the stem is conducted the
formation of the callus in cuttings and the union of
grafts is also a fimction of this layer hence its
ihiportance from the foresters and horticulturists standpoint when a ring
of bark which is usually found in three layers outerj
middle and inner is removed but the wood 15 uninjured
the leaves will not widier hence the condusion that the
water ascends through the wood if the ring be thrtiu
the young wood the leaves will wither hence the deduction
that the ascent of water is through the young wood
this conclusion is corroborated by the fact that trees will
flourish after the heart wood has decayed the descent of

english edition of a ten stenciling a mode of decorating
or marking with paint or ink in which the design
is formed through the spaces of a pattern the design
or pattern is cut out in a sheet of paste
board or a thin ate of metal called a stencil
whidi i applied to whatever is to be marked the
paint or other coloring matter is then laid freely over
the stetidl by means of a brush and after the
stencil is removed the design re mains marked out on
those parts of the sur face which the coloring matier
has reached through the spaces left in the stencil stencils
a stencil is a drin metal plate or a fibrous
or waxed sheet of paer bearing wording or a design
formed by cutting ihrougn the plate or die chemical coating
or waxed sur face of a paper sheet or by
embossing ttie wording upon a thin metal plate the stencil
is used to reproduce quickly characters designs or wording by
rubbing or pressing through tbe cut ikgtrtions specially prepared stendl
ink or stencil paste or in the case of embossed
sten cils sinkiiig the paper against an inked ribbon covering
the raised letters stencils have been in use for several
ceo s of marking characters upon stampink wood cloth and
paper material tating natural pictorial worlc upon iiir panels and
pottery the japanese for hundreds of years have practised while
the eptia ng while the eptians and romans were n
verged in it also it is claimed that the japanese
learned the craft from the chinese who perhajis can be
credited as being one of the first onginators these early
stencils were probably not made of metal but of some
lough fabric paper or wood the metal stencils used 90
extensively today in commercial trades have been developed from the
pictorial stencils only within the past 50 years or so
we have definite knowledge that during our civil war stenctl
cutting was practised in america the atendls bong used for
markii paxljug boxes and other shipments and were cut in
metal in about die same manner as stendl cutters cut
them now from that time there has been a huge
dis ffland for commerdal siencilt as they can be made
quickly economically and pleasing to the eye the can be
made very small or extremely large their size being governed
only by the di mensions of the metal sheet or
the object upon which diey are to be imprinted any
lettering brand traidemark or other design can be made into
stendl form and as such can be reproduced upon any
suitable object by placing it against this object and brushing
in the letters or design with stencil paste being cut
from sheet metal stencils naturally are durable and conveniently handled
the most artistic stencils are those that are laid out
by an experienced stencil cut ter who is talented in
making good designs this man will sketch out his lettering
or design on a piece of sheet brass copper or
zinc with a pepdl and then cut out the perfected
design with special stencil chisels thirty or 40 chisels of
vaiions curves and sizes and straight chisels from onrdiirtysecond to
one and onequarter inch wide are used for this purpose
the cutter pladng the sheet metal upon a block of
lignum vitk and chipping out the metal in the design
leaving occasional strips of metal known as ties or sts
so that the design or letters wilt hold together ordinarily
letlerinc from one quarter inch to one and onchall inches
is usually cut with stencil dies these stendl dies are
steel punches each bearing a letter of the alphabet or
one of the numerals and when driven into the sheet
metal with a blow of a hammer will cut out
the selected letter or figure by using a series of
these stendl dies words can be quicklv cut into the
metal in letgt ters of various heights if desired the
stendl can then be flattened by burnishing it or going
over if with a special instrument called a slapper and
then smoothing it with the mallet on the stencil block
stencils for commercial use are frequently made by a special
type of machine which cuts letters out of oil board
or paste board such stencils are less durable than metal
and necessarily bear only the one style of lettering stencils
for transferring patterns 35 in embroideiy are usually made upon
heavy eper the lines of the design being indicated smalt
holes pierced through the paper for wall decorations either the
cut or the perforated stencils are used the design being
cut h hand with sharp knives of various shapes in
thin metal lead foil tin foil or prepared paper held
against a piece of plate glass another kind of stendl
is the waxed paper which is used in mimeograph work
and the dermatype stencil a chemically coated fibrous sheet of
great toughness which is converted into a stencil by the
impression of type or stylus with this form of stendl
the fibrous sheet is prepared ready for use of a
size about the dimensions of the typewriter paper it is
in serted in the typewriter and a uquid is applied
to it with a brush when it is ready for
the type matier with the ribbon of the typewriter re
moved or held away from contact with the keys an
attachment usually fitted to typewriters fne pressure of the keys
separates the chenilcal coating on the fibrous sheet after all
the wording required is typed on the sheet the lat
ter is removed and spread over an inked cylin der
of a hand or motordriven press paper of about the
usuaf typewriter size is run be tween this cyhnder and
a platen roller in whirfi operation a small amount of
ink is squeezed through all of the places in the
fibrous sheet where the typewriter keys have nude ati im
pression which brings out all the letters on the sheet
of par in a very satisfactory manner for mechanically addressing
a portion of tus google eie stenda stkphanvs fibrous sheet
enclosed in a frame of paper is placed in id
a special attachment that can be fitted to a ttewriter
and the wording can then by typed through the coating
on the fibre as explained above stencils for addressing pur
poses are also made by cuttini out stnali letters from
stiti per by embossing metal plates or perforating thin metal
plates or paper these jierforated cut or embossed stendls for
addressing are made by special machines which stamp dies bearing
letters or numerals with cutting edges or punching surfaces as
the case may be against the stiff paver or thin
metal from these small stencils the address is im printed
upon the desired place on a paper by means of
other machines either hand or power driven the usual machine
for this purpose holds a tray of these stencils and
automatically carries each one over an inked pad where the
ink is forced through the letters and printed npon the
paper by the pressure of an arm that bears upon
the stencil from above this arm of the machine moves
up when the pressure is released and if adjusted for
the purpose dis poses of the used stencil by pushing
il to one side at the same time it moves
forward the next stencil into its proper position on the
pad the addressing from embossed sten dl addresses is performed
by bringing down a plunger in which there is a

to locomotive engines had for some time engaged the attention
of scientific men stephenson eagerly devoted himself to the working
out of the idea and hav ing establied an extended
reputation for soundness of judgement and eneineerin skill he was
supplied by lord ravensworth with the means of constructing a
locomotive ercine which was placed 25 july 1814 on the
colliery tramway and drew eight loaded wagons at the rate
of four miles an hour though thus partially successful stephenson
saw that more was needed to make this mode o
conveyance advantageous and be accordiiiy invented the steam blast which
enabled him to double his rate of speed and in
1815 he took out a patent for and constructed an
engine which up to the present day under certain modifications
and improve meats has like watts steam engine continued as
a model in he construction of locomotives in this same
year he devised a safetylamp the geordie for miners which

as oods at this period a copartnership was ormed between
pease and stephenson for the establishment of a locomotive manufactory
at newcastle which was long the only work of the
kind in the kingdom and rapidly increased in extent and
importance the scheme of con structing a railway between liverpool
and manchester had been set on foot in 1824 but
the opposition to it both in and out of parlia
ment was so strong that it had to be tern
porarily abandoned the bill was passed how ever on a
second application and the work commenced in 1326 after overcoming
many difficiilties one of the greatest being the carry ing
of the fine over chatmoss the railway was opened on
is scpl 1830 the results of the undertaking were most
triumphant for stephen son and it proved the commencement of
the british system of railroad transit for 10 years subsequent
to this there was scarcely a line of railway opened
in great britain with the construction of which stephenson was
not concerned in 1840 he resigned most of his ap
pointments and settled at tapton in derby shire where be

stereochemistry greek sterrcs iolid in the development of the science
of chemistry it was discovered that two or more compounds
may have the same empirical for mubt and yet differ
from one another in chem ical and pcat properties to
a marked degree resordn pyrocatechin and hydroquinone for fact that
he bodies that manifest it differ with respect to their
action upon polarized lit it has long been known that
certain cr3tal3 possess the power of rotating the plane of
dolarization of the light that they transmit it is also
known that the citstals of a sub stance that affects
liriit in this manner may sometimes be obtained in two
slightly different forms which possess symmetry of the same kind
and whose corresponding angles are equal but which differ in
the same manner as a mans rijt hand differs from
his left one or as the image of an object
as seen in a mirror differs from the object itself
a pair of crjtals that differ only in this respect
are said to be enantiomorphous and if one of them
rotates the plane of polarization to the right the other
when similarly placed will rotate it to the left the
angle of rotation being the same in each case if
the crystals are of equal thick ness if two such
enantiomorphous crystals of the same substance are melted or dis
solved the respective fluids that are obtained from them are
commonly foimd to be identical with each other in all
reict5 so that if they affect ffie plane of polarization
at all the rotate it in the same direction and
by the same amount it is plain that in cases
of this sort the differences between the olriginal crystals are
of a purely physical nature depending only upon the way
in which the molecules of the substance are groupei and
not at all tipon the internal structure of those molechies
in other words two enantiomorphous crystals are to be regarded
as composed of identically the same chemical substance if they
differ only in their optical properties and become identical in
all respects upon being melted or dissolved stereo chemistry has
nothing to do with substances of this sort which are
not to be regarded as in any sense stereochemistry deals
ile all have the empirical formula oh and yet they
are distinctly differ ent substances most cases of this kind
are the several compounds the compounds them selves being called
isomers and the phenom enon isomerism see ibomeribu arouattc compottnds
fatty comjwunds the arrange ment of the atoms in such
compounds has been investigated in many of these cases and
con stitutional formulae have been devised for the purpose of
rgtresenting the internal structures of their molecules compounds have tgteen
foimd to exist however which apparently have the same conslitutionat
formulie and which resemble one another very closely indeed in
most respects but which nevertheless exhibit certain differences in physical
and chemical properties so that they cannot be regarded as
absolutely identical it is the province of sterectchemistry to investieate
sudi bodies and to show bow it is possible to
reconcile their exceedingly close similarity with the existence of recognizable
differences in certain respects isomerism of the kind here contemplated
is coaubonly called optical isomerism from the tlq2 entirely widi
substances whose optical differ ences are manifested even in the
liquid state and hence are to be attributed to internal
differ ences in the molecules rather than to mere differences
in the grouping of the molecules among themselvea as a
simple example of optical isomerism the case of tactic acid
and its isomers may be cited lactic acid which occurs
in sour milk and which may be extracted in the
form of a syrupy liquid has no effect upon polarized
light but sarcolactic acid which occurs in the juice of
flesh rotates the plane of polari zation to the rigt
and et its chemical proper ties are practically identical with
those of com mon lactic acid a third acid known
as laevo rotatory lactic acid has been prepared which is
almost indistinguishable from the two foregoing substances so far as
its chem ical properties are concerned but which rotates d
google 6m stsreochemistay the plane of polariiacion to ihe left
the chem ical properties of all three agree with the
con stitutional formula chtchohcooh and gtei they cannot be regarded
as chemicallv iden tical when polarized lieht is passed through
equal thicknesses of equally concentrated solu tions of sarcolactic and
uevo rotatory lactic acids the plane of polarization is rotated
in opposite directions but by the same amount and when
equal luantities of sarcolactic ana lavarotatory lactic acids are mixed
the mix ture has no effect upon the plane of
polariza tion and in fact the mixture cannot be dis
tinguished from ordinary lactic acid in any way these general
characteristics are manifested by alt of the simpler optical isomers
they occur in pairs or twins one member of which
rotates the plane of polarization to the right while the
other rotates it equally to the left a third isomer
also exists which is composed of equal parts of the
two optically active ones and which is therefore itself inactive
the in active member of the group is often called
the modification the name being derived cooh oh ch gh
oh pig 4 from racemic add which is an optically
inac tive mixture of dextrorotatory and ijevorota tory tartaric adds
this statement it is to be observed applies only to
the simpler cases of optical isomerism for a more general
state ment applicable in all cases see below in 1874
le bel and vant hoff simultane ously and independently pointed
out that all known compounds which manifest optical isomerism contain
at least one asymmetrical or unsymmetfical central atom in most
of the known cases this central asymmetrical atom is a
carbon atom but a few caes are now known in
which it is nitrogen the chemistry of asymmetrical nitrogen compottnds
is stilt in its infancy however and hence in the
present article attention will be confined solely to the asymmetrical
carbon atoms and we shall first treat of compounds in
which only one such carbon is a telravalent substance having
four valencies or bonds and it has been well established
especially by the exhaustive re searches of l ffenry that
these four valencies of carbon are all alike so that
if one atom of hydrogen in methane chi for example
be replaced by one atom of any other mono valent
substance such as chlorine the resulting compound is precisely the
same whichever of the nydrogen atoms is so replaced the
funda mental discovery of le bel and vant hoff was
that the sinyjiest class of the substances which exhibit critical
isomerism may be regarded as derived from methane by substitutii
for at least three of the hydrorcn atoms that it
con tains an equal number of monovalent atoms or radicals
no two o which are alike so that the restiliing
compound consists of a central nucleus of carbon each of
whose valencies is satisfied by a different atom or rachcal
a at bon atom whose valencies are satisfied in this
way is called an asymmetrical carbon atom cooh cooh h

wluch have already been cited one of the fundamen tal
hydrogen atoms o the methane remains undisturbed while the other
three ace respec tively replaced by oh ch and cooh
the structural formula of any one of these acids ch
may therefore be written oh c cooh h the central
carbon atom is here the asymmct ric atotn since its
four bonds are satined 1 four unliice univalent radicals or
atoms from the admitted equality and similarity of the four
carbon bonds it appears to be inadmis sible to suppose
that the nature of the com pound that is represented
above can depend for example upon whether the cooh group
is opposite the oh group or adjacent to it le
bel and vant hoff liowever suggested that we should think
of the four carbon bonds not as four lines radiating
out from the carbon atom in some one plane but
as lines ladiating out from the carbon atoms in space
in four sym metrically related directions the carbon atom being
represented by a ven point in space for example we
are to think of the fotir bonds that it has
as corresponding to the four vertioes of an equilateral tetrahedron
having the caihon atom at its centre for the take
of ftinher illustration let us suppose that we are locridng
down upon one of the vertices of such an equi
lateral tetrahedron as suggested in figs 1 and 2 and
let us represent the four dissimilar radi cals or atoms
by which the four bonds of the carbon are satisfied
by the letters a b d and we may suppose
that in one of the sptically active isomers these four
radicals are isposed as in fig 1 and in the
other as rep resented in fig 2 it is evident
that two sub stances having such similar constitutions would be
chemically so similar that it would be diffi cult to
distinguish than by any ordinary test and yet it is
evident that they are not identical siiure it will be
found to be impassible to super pose either of these
tetrahedra upon ihe other one in such a way as
to bring into cdincidence all the vertices that carry similsr
radicals or atoms in fact these two tetrahedra tesenlble each
other enantiomorphically just as the image of an object in
a mirror rescmues the d google ktbre6chehistrt object iuew am
supwosition is therefore impossible th constitution of sarcolaaic add according
to tfcis general scheme might be rep resented as in
kg 3 that of lacvo rotatory iactic add being then
represented as in fig 4 the central dot by which
we have here repre sented the asyntffletric carbon atom in
each of these coinigtoundr is usuatly omitted from diagramb of
this sort the presence of this atom beuig sutfidently represented
by the tetrahedron itsel the name stereochemistry has reference to
the use of a solid diaeram for representiite the constitutions
of the compounds with which it is concerned and the
ideas which have been presented abote are qapable of being
expanded into a general theory of the constitution of carbon
compotiiids the first successful attempt at the fottdtilation of a
theory of this sort was itialte hy vant hoff in
1878 in this the ory which includes the explanation of
isomer ism of all kinds by the geometric relations of
the solid diagrarna that are used and which is therefore
often called the theory of geometri cal isomerism each carbon
atom in a given compound is supposed to be represented
by separate tetrahedron thou in the practical applications of the
theory it is customary tq omit all the tetrahedra except
thoae that rate to the central carbon atom or to
those which are of special or fundamental importance when two
carbon atoms are united by a sinele bond their carre
sppndinf tetrahedra arc sup posed to be united in such
a way that they are symmetrically situated with one vertex
in com mon wherl they are united by two bonds
they are suppltked to be symmetrically situated with one eoge
in common and when they are united by three bonds
they are supposed to have one entire face in common
in the case of the triple bond the theory has
no special interest for in this case theory does not
indicate any possibility of isomerism nor has experiment revealed any
case of this kind in which isomer ism exists the
use of a solid diagram for illustrating the isomerism of
compounds con taining two carbon atoms united by a double
bond will be understood from figs 5 and 6 which
correspond respectively to maleic and fumaric adds see maleic acid
there is no optical isomerism in the case of these
com pounds this drcumstance being explained ac cording to the
theory of geometrical isomerism by the fact that the points
of attadiment of the hydrogen atoms and the cooh groups
are in each case all in the same plane uoreover
there is no asymmetric carbon atom in ther case be
cause if the tetrahedra were separated they could be turned
so as to be perfectly superos able the relative distances
between the points of attachment of corresponding radicals or atoms
is not the same in fig s as in fig
6 and hence it is to be expected that the
isomers that these diagrams represent will behave differ ent with
respect to solubility melting point boiling point and in other
respects also includ ing tlie facility with which they will
react with other substances it may be noted in passing
that the atoms and radicals shown in fi 5 and
6 admit of still another arrangement in which both of
he hydrogen atoms are attached to one of the tetrahedra
and both of the carboxyl groups cooh are attached to
the other one the substance having this structure is actually
known and is called methylenemalonic acid its properties are quite
different however from those of maidc and fumaric acids as
might be inferred from the markedly different character of its
structural diagram tartaric acid affords an interesting example in stereochemistry
not only on account of its structure but also because
it was upon this add and its modifications that pasteur
per formed the classical experiments which led lt18b0gt to the
development of the methods that are now used for the
separation of optical iso mers the constitutional formula for tartaric
acid as ordinarily written is h ho c cooh ho
c cooh each of the two central carbon atoms is
here asymmetric because each has its four bonds satisfied by
four different tubsiances in the sohd diagratn for representing the
stnicttire of tartaric add we shall therefore have to make
ugte of two tetrahedra and since the two nu clear
carbon atoms are tampiotly united by one bond thdr corresponding
tetrahedra will be symmetrically situated and wiuhave one vertex in
common in attaching the hydrogen the lurdrox oh and tlie
carboixyl cooh to the vertices or ie tetrahedra we may
adopt any one of three essentially different arrange menls for
representing the relations expressed by the foregoing structural formula these
are shown in figs 7 8 and 9 it will
be observed in fig 7 that the radicals and atoms
that are attached to the vertices are so sitnated that
the two tetrahedra would be superposable in all respects if
they were separated from each other according to stereochemical theory
this signi fies that the compound that fig 7 represents
will rotate the plane of polarized light by an amount
equal to the sum of the effects oi the two
constituent asymtnetrical tetrahedra tifm ing now to fig 6 it
will be seen that the two tetrahedra in wis diagram
also admit of super position upon themselves if they are
separated and hence the compound that this diagram rep resents
will also rotate the plane of polarization by an amount
that is equal to the sum of the effects that
are due to its two constituent tetra hedra it wilt
be noted however that neither of the tetrahedra in fig
8 can be superposed upon either of those in fig
7 and this fact when taken in connection with the
identity of the two types of tetrahedra in all other
re spects signifies that the compounds that are represented by
figs 7 and 8 will rotate the plane of polarization
by equal amounts but in opposite directions fig 7 may
therefore be taken to represent dextrorotary tartaric add while fig
8 represents the tevorotatory va riety of the same substance
in the coniwura tion shown in fig 9 it will
be observed that the two tetrahedra if separated cannot be
superposed for they are enantiomorphic or re spectively righthanded and
lefthanded ac cording to the theories of stereochemistry one d
google 8tsksochehistry of these tetrahedra tends to cause the plane
of polarization o polarized light to rotate to the right
while the other tends to rotate it by an equal
amount to the left and hence llie sub stance as
a whole will be optically inactive in addition to these
three varieties of tartaric acid all of which are known
and can be ac tually prepared there is a fourth
variety which is optically inactive but which is not really
chemically distinct from the varieties that have been described this
is known as racemic acid and it consists of a
mere mixture of equal parts of the dextrorotatoiy and isvo
rotatory adtls crtheless observable and these render the separation of
the isomers possible special methods of separation may be adopted
in spe cial cases but the three general methods that
we have and which are due to paateur are as
follows i the mixed isomers are caused to combine with
some other substance whose iso meric compounds exhibit differences in
melting point solubility or cryslallizatkin and when the compounds have
been separated by the usual methods applicable in such coses
they are separately decomposed so as to liberate the isomers
of the orinal substance again cooh cooh cooh cooh cooh
di1itr0jwitat0rv ltxorotworh flct cooh mctwe pic the general facts of
optical isomerism are thus stated by nemst i no compounds

the two substances corresponding to the first horiionial row are
called isomeric twins since ihey produce equal rotations but in
op posite directions if the compound has n asym metrical

which contain asymmetric carbon atoms are not necessarily optically active
for the rotation that they pro duce may be too
small to admit of detection or the internal structure may
be such as lo pro duce internal optical compensation as
in the case of fig 9 or the compound may
be a mix ture of the dextrorotatory and ifevo rotatory
isomers as in the case of racemic acid alrea optical

in separate enantiomorphous crystals from which the crystals of one
type can be picked out by hand this method was
used by pasteur with success in the case of sodium
ammonium racemate but it is not of very general applicability
because the isomeric salts usually separate out together in one
mass in conclusion it may be well to say that
it is not at all probable that the atoms of
carbon compounds are actually arranged in space in accordance with
the geometric representations that are adopted in stereochemical theory tile

stigmata greek stigma mark puncture brand a mark made with
a redhot iron a brand impressed on slaves and others
the original greek signifi cation of the word has received
many secondary meanings owing to its association with the branding
of slaves stigma has come to have the signification of
a mark of infamy a slur at tached to any
one on account of evil conduct n anatomy stigma bears
a meaning closer to the original signification of the word
which was to puncture with a sharp pointed instrument this
sense is closely related to that of the eng lish
verb to stick meaning to pierce puncture or stab with
a pen or other pointed weapon the expression t0 stick
one with a stick con veys the meaning and shows
the derivation of the english word which is related to
the eng lish to sting and the german sleeken to
pride ihcrce sting thrust and stab these being the eqiiivalents
of stigma in the english language the greek word came
to have in english a more or less popular usage
only one of its sig nifications and that metaphorical being
derived from its association with slaves and outcasts the official
marks on whom came to be sym bolical with social
and moral degradation but science has gone back to the
original sense of die greek word and has given us
nn merons scientific terms in modem english de rived from
the greek or from its latin deriv ative in anatomy
and zoology stigma is used in the sense of a
mark point or noticeable place as for example a naevus
a trirthmark the place on the surface of an ovary
where there is a rupture of a mature graafian follicle
is termed a stigma the word also signifies a chitinous
mark on the anterior margin of the forewings of numerous
insects it is the term used to designate the interior
orifice of a trachea a spot of pigment in protozoa
one of the pores of the segmental organs a ciliated
opening connecting the cavity of the pharynx with that of
the artificial canal any mark on the skin which bleeds
periodically or even at irregular intervals is also termed a
siigma none of these uses of the term departs from
the root meaning of the word which as we have
seen was to puncture or prick with the substantive sense
of the thing punctured or pricked in botany the stigma
is a part of the style or in the absence
of the latter of the surface of the ovary which
receives the pollen siigma was used in greek g signature
which is slill used sometimes for sl it also designated
the number six stigmata the greek plural form of stigma
is used in various collective significations anatomical stigmata for instance
comprises irregularities or mat formations of various parts of the
anatomy among them being those of the face the skullcap
palate teeth tongue lips nose ears limbs fingers thorax and
in gen eral any part of the human anatomy the
presence of less or more than four fingers on one
human hand would be stigma as would be the dwarfing
or over growth of the frame of man or animal
abnormal conditions of the skin hair and umbs are also
characterized as stigmata often these persistent stigmata are used as
signs b which to judge abnormal con ditions or physical
mental or moral degeneracy in an individual these abnormalities have
been classified by peterson as belonging to 1 motor functions
2 sensory functions 3 speech 4 genitrourinary function s i
appetite 6 diminished r diseases and external influences 7 delayed
development of puberty under the head of psychical stigmata are
classified all kinds of irregular functions of the mind from
simple feeblemi ndedness eccentric ity moral delinquency and sexual perversion
to idiocy and embecility in this section stigmata have been
uvided and subdivided by scientists and speciahsts into a large
number of classes and a vast nutiaier of interesting and
important experiments have been made to show the rela tion
of each separate abnormality to the norma individual frederick peterson

by roman catholic writers to the im pression on certain
individuals of the stig mata or marks of the wounds
which christ suffered during the course of his passion in

were practised by enthusiasts the stiemala comprise not only the
wounds of the hanih and feet and that of the

remarkable example of stigmatization is that narrated of saint francis
of assisi and occurring in lt24 on the mountain of

christ he saw a seraph with six shining wings blazing
with fire and having between his wings the figure of
a man cruafied descend from heaven and approach hiiil so
as to be almost in contact after a time the
vision disappeared leaving the sonl of francis filled with reverence
and awe and now he became aware that in hands
feet and side he had received externally the marks of
cruiciampxion these mysterious diarks continued during the two jiears until
his death and are declared by the saints biograph ers
to have been seen by many eyewitnesses including pope alexander
iv the dominicans openly disputed the fact but at length
made the same claim for catharine of sienna whose stigmata
were explained as at her own request made invisible to
others the franciscans appealed to sixtus iv and that pope
himself a franciscan forbade representa tions of saint catherine to
be made with the stigmata still the fact is recorded
in the breviary oflice and benedict xiii granted the domimcans
a special feast in commemoration of it many others especially
women are enumerated as having received all or some of

that some kind of stigmatization is a pathologi cal condition
of occasional occurrence the roman catholic cburch is extremely cautious
in giving credence to cases of stigmatization as genuinely supernatural

to admit for stigmatization other than a perfectly natural character

light on the early history of man and the rise
of civilization present knowledge indicates that man as distinct from
other primates originated in central asia and at first utilized
for food and clothing wild plants and wild anitnals as
the most primitive races of mankind still do later plants
began to be cultivated and animals kept and reared in
captivity to insure more de pendable supplies of food and

liiotbodsthe method of the present day breeder is that of
all his predeces sors who more or less consciously and
iptelt sently have wortced for the improvement of omesiic animals
the method is toselect in each generation and to rear
offspring from those animals which are best suited to the
special purpose for which the breed is kept bf it
milk meat wool work or what not llius breeds for
special purposes are created and further improved but the work
of the animal breeder is less simple than this statement
might each of which inlluences the character qf the offspring
each selection of animals for propd gatiou thus involves a
double selection sefeciiod of a sire and selection of a
dam and it is nol suffidem fhat each be excellent
for its kind the two must be conatible in the
inherited traits which they transmit otherwise undesir able combinations of
characters may be ov tained in the offspring or a
lack ot the de sired uniformity in dinetcut individuals the
breeders first principle of success is ac cording 1 select
the best individuais to breed from his second principle is
iz mate each selected animal vath one jwving conpalibie characters
this in general will mean the mat ing of like
with like selecting mtes only wiihia ibe same established breed
or subbreed but here comes in a danger which nuist
be avoided if animals mos like each other in inherited
traits are mated together brother will be aiatfld with sister
or cousin with couun but asttoitf cxperienca shows that such
matings veiyofmn result in diminished vi89r size or fecuoiuty and
so tbe careful breeder is reluctant to rqaott to flose

is an important principle utilized by animdl breeders in meat
production among catfle sheep and pigs distinct breeds are crossed
such as shorthorn and angus cattle or berkshire and durocjersey
pigs the result is 10 produce iti animal superior to
either pure breed as regards rapid growth and early maturity
biit thii superiority persists for a single generation only so
that the production of a second generation from tbe vigorous
crossbreeds is not to be recommended lack of uniformity both

occur in the second generation though not in d google
stock brbledino ihe first a fourth maxim for the breeder
would be 4 employ erossbreeding whenever praclicabu la increase vigor
bt do not go be yond tht fint cross while
the variable second crossbred genera tion is of little use
to the ordinary breeder it may be of great value
to the experimental breeder who is engaged not in mere
quantity production of a standard type of animal as the
ordinary breeder is but in the attempt to pro duce
a new type of animal better suited for some special
purpose than are existing types the experimental breeder works by
the method of crossing two breeds each of which contains
a difeerenl inherited character or sel of charac ters which
he desires to combme in one new race crossbreeding is
the only method by which characters found in different races
may be combined in a single new race seldom is
the desired combination secured in the first crossbred generation more
often it will only be found in a small percentage
of the second generation crossbreds obtained by breeding amprst generation
crossbreds with each other such animals of the second generation
crossbreds as do present the desired combination of charac ters
may nerw be mated with each other and a new
race of the desired type may thus be secured but
at first it is apt to be rather variable and
several additional generations of selection are usually required fuljy to
establish die new type the production of a new breed
is thus a difficult and expensive undertaking and should be
tried only by experts familiar ivith the method of inheritance
of different cbaracteriatics the fundamental law of inheritance which ftnderhes
ciiaracter recombination in new breeds and to which also established
breeds owe their uniformity is known as mendels law qv
this is the taw of irnit character in heritance in
accordance with which the dif ferent inherited characters are fotmd
to behave like independiant units in transmission and so can
be rearranged in new conlbinations each individual of an established
breed of animali tranuotts a certain assemblage of inheiitance units
which constitute the bteed duncteriatics so long as matings are
made only within the breed all the progeny have these
same inherited breed characteristic such as black color and ixvnlegsuess
in the case of aberdeenai ttle red color and homlessness
in the case of red polled cattle red color and
boms in the case of devon cattle and white face
and bernt in the case of hereford cattle but it
we cross a breed ot black cattle with a breed
of red cattle the first generation ofi spring will be
black the color unit black being stroller than the color
unit red we call black the dominant unit of the
two and red the re cessive tmit but the black
crossbreds have inherited red no less than black even though
they do not show it and they will transmit it
to half ihcir progeny the alternative with black being transmitted
lo the other half of the progeny accordingly if a
crossbred blacv bull is mated with red cows we find
that on the average half the calves are black in
coloi and half are red this comes about as follows
the crossbred bull iranfmits the black unit to half bis
calves this unit meets a red unit transmitted by the
red dam and dominates it producing a black calf to
the transmitted by the red dam and thus produces a
pure red combination such reds will breed true because they
contain only the red umtf but the blacks whidi contain
also a red tmit will not breed true nevertheless true
breeding blacks may be obtained even from crossbreds by mating
black with black if the crossbred black bull were mated
with pure black cows half his calves would be pure
blacks viz those to which he transmitted the black unit
for to all the calves in such matings the black
dam would transmit the black unit if the crossbred bull
were mated with crossbred cows one fourth of the calves
would be pure blacks two fourths would be impure blacks
not true breeding and onefourth would be pure reds for
each parent would transmit impartially either the black or the
red tmit and tte ex pected combinations would be unit
tnnmiitted by dn b or r oniu tnnsnitted by dual
b or r if the two breeds of cattle which
we crossed were aberdeen angus and red polled all the
crossbred calves would be polled since bo4 breeds possess this
same unit but if we crossed a4terdeenangns cattle which are
black and polled with devon cattle which are red but
have horns we should get a different re sult vit
imperfectly developed horns scurs in the crosmreeds which would all
be black a crossbred bull of this sort would transmit
to half bis calves the iled condition and to half
he would transmit horns to half be would transmit bbtck
color and to half he wonld tnuiemit red cakic but
horns and color arc distinct units in herediiy hence the
com ampmammf of unifs which a crossbred of this sort
mt trannnit would be of four sotil viz polled black
tted red hoisted made and homed td in fact iimals
presemtine lliese four tcmts of combirations would be ohtained in
the second generation of croasbreds pro duced inr mating first
generation crossbreds with each other this case iuuatratcs how the
imnciple of anit character inheritance may be utilised to secure
new combinations of inheri tance units in whidi breads diflier
the maxi mum number of reeot jm nations may be
ob tained in the second crossbnd not the first crossbred
genenuion this principle has ungt doubted been utilized comaonsiy or
nocon ciotisty r producing extstii breds and can be used
more frrcly in the inture because its veralions are now
better understood never theless the crossing of bree is somediing
which should be tmdertaken catitionsl for it will be found
that few cases are as simple a the hypothetical one
just ltscu8sed most breeds differ by a great many tmit
dtaracters and a cross in such cases produces an extrem
ely variable second geoention because of the lare number of
recombinslions of chsmcten which will be obtained tui few of
these re combinatione even if desirle can be isolated in
true breeding types without stibsequent selec tion through several generations

in crosses extremely dilcult differences in size early matnrity and
produc tiveness are amonr the most valued economic characters of
breeds yet these in no rase behave e units but
yield intermediates or blends a second crossbred generation asain yields
blends but with increased variability ving indications of segregation more
or less com plete this is inicrpreled as meaning that
many lestina units are involved which seere gale and recoinbine
independently of each omer in such cases crosses are useful
only if the stoduction of intermediates is desired if it
is esired to extend the range of existing vari ation
in quantitative characters it is better not to cross breeds
but to practise systematic selec tion in the desired direction
within the breed which most nearly approaches the ideal for
example suppose increased quantity production of milk is desired in
cattle the most produc tive of existing breeds is admitted
to be the holstein fries an if this breed is
crossed with a less productive breed the offspring are found
to be of intermediate productiveness such a cross would not
be a promising means of obtaining productiveness greater than that
of the hokteinfriestan it would be bcrtcr to seanh within
the breed for families of unusual productiveness and try further
to improve these best families hy selection avoiding close iit
breedirig however iw matmg with each other representatives of different
families of great excellence this is the practise now followed
by the best informed breeders still there are conditions under
which crossbreeding even of holsteinfriesian cattle may be desirable holstein
milk contains loo little butter fat to satisfy some markets
impr cured will offset the diminished quantity pro duction entailed
by the cross and the undesirable variability of the later
crossbred generations is a matter for experimental delermi nation a

the stoic system of losoph and practical atttltide toward life
the stoic school of philosophy was founded at athetis about
300 bc by zeno a native of ciliuin in cyprus
it received its name from the stoa pcerile or mottled
porch where iti meetings were held zeno had been a
pupil of the cyaic crates and in its essential principle
stoidim may be regarded as the continoation and sci eniific
development of cynidsra qv the successor of zeno in the
leadership of the school was cleanthes the author of the
hymn to zeus who died 251 bc he was followed
by chrysippus who on account of his great activity as
a teacher and writer is sometimes called the second founder
of the school the leadership at athens then passed the
order to zeno of tarsus thogenes of seleucia and antipaler
of tarsus of the numerous writ ings of these men
and their contemporaries only a few fragments have come down
to us pansetius of rhodes 180110 bc and his contemporary
boelhius of sidon introduced new elements into stoicism bnnginff it
into closer relations with the systems of plato and aristotle
it was mainly through the influence of the former that
stoicism was introduced into rome panaetius was the friend of
scipio africanus and of lkhus and the teacher in philosophy
of many roman youths of dis tinguished famines cato the
younger is per haps the most famous roman stoic of
the time of the republic by the time of the
empire the original form of stoicism had been greatly modilied
by the prevailing eclecticism of the ae and may almost
be said to have ceased to exist as a scientific
system it still survived however as a popular moral philosophy
and in this form gave expression to many of the
noblest ethical and religious convictions of the ancient world its
chief representatives at this time whose works are still extant
were seneca epictetns and the emperor marcus aurelius stoidsm like
all the later systems of grcetc lthought was prhnarilv practical
in dtaracter the end and object of philosophy for the
stoic was to teach vhtiire at the art of rit
livbig but in order to act rightly it is necessary
to be able to reason correctly and to understand the
nature of the universe of which man is a part
hence logic and physics were regarded as indispensable preliminary studies
for ethics bat not as possessing an independent value of
their own the extensive logical investigations tmdertakcn by the stoics
contributed uttle of permanent value for the devevopment of the
sciefice in physics their general view of the universe may
be described aa pantheistic materialism whatever exists is for the
stoics a material body not only do they maintaampi that
all substances includii the soul and jodare corporeal bnt they
go on to det ecribe as material all properties and
relations ijsh 607 of things and even virtues and vices
their view of the world was however essentially dynamic all
is process and movement more over the worldprocess forms a
single whole whose unitary principle is sometimes de scribed in
material terms similar to those of heraclitus qv as 6re
of warm breath some times in spiritual terms as god
providence the logos or universal reason ot universal law in
spite of the variety of terms these names all have
for the stoics the same meaning and de scribe at
once both the essential substances of the world and the
ordering power and prin ciple according to which it is
regulated there is no distinction to be made between god
and the world between matter and force further these statements
imply that every part of the world is ruled by
the same unchanging laws and is thus subjected to strict
necessity there is no chance or contingency anywhere every thing
is ruled and govemed by unvarying laws man only differs
from the other parts of the universe in that as
possessing consciousness and reason he is able to leam the
laws ol nature and to follow them consciously and voluntarily
hence we find that the funtumen tal doctrine of the
stoic ethics is contained in the injunction to follow nature
to lead a life according to nature this general prin
ciple was made more specific however when it was pointed
out it is said by chrysispis that the laws of
nature with which man is most directly and intimatdy concerned
arc those of human nature and that he must there
fore obey the fundamental laws which are found within himself
this implies that rea son the fundamental principle of human
nature shall govern action between the reason and the life
of feeling and emotion tbcre is the sharpest opposition the
highest good is not pleasure or any object of desire
but virtue the end which reasoo shows to be in
harmony with our true nature this sharp antithis between virtue
and pleasure was doubtless made more emphatic by the rivalry
between the stoic and the epicurean schools to regard pleasure
as the good is they maintain to lose sii of
the true nature of virtue to base it upon the
feel ings and emotions which are subject to ex ternal
circumstances and thus to deprive a man of his moral
freedom and independence the ideal of the wise man plays
a very im portant part in the stoic ethics the
wise maq is completely free and independent com pletely independent
of external circumstances and entirely emancipated from the bondage of
the desires and emotions for him virtue is the only
good and vice the only evil all ex ternal circumstances
are indinerent health power riches even life itself are not
real goods nor is pain poverty contempt or death evils
he has completely mastered his posses sions through the insight
of reason and the resttlting strength of will and has
attained to a state of apathy or freedom from the
sway of the emotions this ideal has been realized at
best by very few men the stoics refer only to
socrates and antislhenes the founder of the cynic school as
examples of its complete ful filment the wise man recognizes
the necessity of all events and welcomes whatever takes place
as a part of the divine order of the d
google sto jowsn stokks the fundamental sioic virtues are thus
strength of will and resifaiion based on rational insight these
enable a man to bear cheerfully whatever lot fortune may
apportion to him even when external circumstances make endurance no
longer possible but would compel a man to unworthy action
he may still triumph by voluntarily withdrawing from life by
smcide the stoic gives up life as he gives up
external goods as a means of preserving his own freedom
and independence and many of the most famous members of
me school com mitted suicide in this spirit in spite
of the emiasis on ihe necessity of independence the stoics
recognize that a life of reason implies social relations with
ones fellowmen and they give an important place in their
system to the social duties and virtues especially to the
im portance of justice mercy and friendship as reason is
the essential basis of society being the common element that
unites a man with his fellows they attach slight importance
to citizenship in a particular country and em phasize the
cosmopolitan idea of sodal unity with all rational beings of
every sodenr and of every country in this and in
other doctrines stoicism especially in its later form goes bv
smd the conceptions usualtv prevailing in reek ethics and approaches
the christian idea of the universal brotherhood of man blbtiograpliy

process of cooking executed by the animal heat of the
body not until the 17th century was the idea advanced
that digestion in the stomach was a chemical pnocess largely
due to ferments in 1752 reaumur and in 1783 spallanzani
established that the main factor in digestion was a secre
tion of the stomach the gastric juice which dissolved and
transformed the ingested food stu5f chemically previous to that djiie
even in the 7th century digestion was thought to be
due to a mechanical trituration of the food reaumur knew
that the secretion of the etotnacb was acid but it
was not until 1834 that prout discovered that the acidity
was due to hydrochloric acid hci in 1836 schwann reccnized
the active ferment of the gastric juice the pepsin a
research work of the most farreaching importance concerning the natilre
at stomach digestion was executed by the american mili tary
sirgeon william beaumont on the stomach of the canadian hunter
alexis st martin after a gunshort wound had oigtened the
organ it healed not perfectly but leaving a fistula permitting
introspection and direct ob jective study of digestion the invesligatians
of beaumont constitute what may justly be designated as the
most epochmaking research on the physiology of the human stomach
experiments and observations on the gas oic juice and the
physiology of digestion plittsburp n y 1833 the digestive pnocesses
in the intestines were first systematically studied by claud benurd
who discovered in 1848 that the pancreatic juice digested tats
corvoisart in 1857 discovered the albumendigesting power of the pancreatic
juice in 1865 the secretion of the intestinal gbnds was
gained in a pure state by thiry valuable contributions to
the physiology of di gestion in the stomach and intestines
have been made by j p pawlow of the institute
for ex perimental medicine saint petersburg these scholarly researches belong
to the most recent acquisitions of our knowledge of the
digestive tract still much remains to be worked ant even
at the present time the function of the bile is
not completely understood nor are the functions of the liver
and pancreas satisfactory ily investigated in a brief and practical
ac count like this the reader seeks only well ascertained
facts and not hypotheses what he wants to know is
1 how tne stomach works under healthy conditions what are
its normal performances and 2 how its abnormal con ditions
are brought about how its diseases are manifested and what
are the best means of avoiding or curing them normal
gastric digestion for an under standing of the normal functions
of the stom ach a brief reference to recent discoveries
is indispensable the stomach is not the main digestive organ
only oneseventh of the entire digesuve process occurs in it
the remaining sixsevenms of digestion are carried on in the
intestines biit it would be a grave error to assume
for this reason that the stomach is not necessary for
the digestive jjrocess for so de pendent is intestinal digestion
upon gastric di gestion that it is impossible to have
a normal digestion in the intestines without a previous digesdon
in the stomach it is also a mistake to assume
that he intestinal digestion is normal in intuviduals who for
surgical reasons have had to imdergo the operation of the
removal of the stomach as a whole or in part
none of such operated cases where the entire stomach was
removed have lived over a year or x months atlhou
they were kept under con stant supervision and the most
careful dietetic control the chemical changes which the various foodarticles
undergo in the stomach are of far reaching importance for
the changes which are to occur in these foods after
they reach the intestines many of the old authors beginning
with the american physiotogistj beaumont be lieve that the mechanical
irritation of the foods causes the gastric secretion but the
expert ments in pawlows laboratory have proved the faibcy of
this view in the first place if the secretions were
due to simple mechanical irrita tion there is no reason
why irritation with the point of a glass rod with
a feather or with sand placed in me stomach should
not also cause the secretion a secretion may be caused
by me chanic irritation but it is composed mainly of
a liquid resembling plasma containing mucus and having no digestive
power the rovstake of the ojder experimenters according lo pawlow
grew out of the fact that they ignored the socalled
piyckic secretion a secretion which can be set up by
the mere smell or sight of food or even by
a very intense feeling of hunger if the oesophagus of
a dc be cut in the neck and it end
sewed to the edges of the wound and at the
same time a fpstric fistula be established pieces of meat
which are fed to the dlt after healing of these
fislulk will not reach the stom ach but will fall
out of the upper end of the fistula leading into
the qsotdiagus neverihfr less in five to six minutes after
the swallowing of the food gastric juice befpns to be
secretctc google e7fl 8t01 lunnine from the gastric canula first
in drops and afterward in a continuous stream if tnc
dog be offered meat without receiving it the gastric secretion
will also appear though not so plentifully as when the
dog was actually allowed to chew the meat a fnrther
interesting fact observed in dogs so experimented on was that
no secretion followed the swallowing of indigestible srbstances like small
stones lliese experiments furthermore suggested that for every kind of
food a definite stric secre tion is formed of specific
composition there fore it has been said that the stomach
provides a special gastric juice to meet each dietetic requirement
it must therefore be further studied whether the mucous membrane
of th stomach is capable of distinguishing between the varieties
and classes of foods that come in contact with it
much as the skin recognizes medianical chemical thermic and electrical
stimtilation it might be asked what is the object of
this psychic secretion for pawlow has clearly es tablished the
existence of two kinds of gastric secretion the chemic and
the pshic this question applied to the human physiology would
be the same as inquiring what is the object of
the appetite the answer is that under the influence of
the psvchic secretion a eastric juice is furnished which is
much more esective than diat which is secreted under purely
chem ical stimulation of the food aat is when food
is taken without any special appetite further more under the
influence of psychic secretion foods which would otherwise not stimulate
the gastric mucosa to secretion become converted by the already
present psychic secretion into something else wnich constitutes a further
stim ulant to the secretion of gastric juice for in
stance if a solution of albumen be administered to a
dog upon which a pawlow operation has been performed that
is splitting off part of the stomach with all the
vessels and nerves in tact and making this second smaller
stomach communicate wits the abdominal wall but not with the
general cavi of the large stomadi from which it is
dissected see hcmmeters practical physiology there will be no secretion
from the small stomach for albumen hy itself does not
excite chemical secretion but if the psychic secretion is previously
set up by some other means before the albumen is
placed in the large stomach for instance by waving a
siece of meat before the dogs eyes aen ollowing the
introduction of albumen a secre tion win be foimd in
the small artifidal stomach which is qualitatively and quantitat ively
greater than the psychic secretion alone or when albumen is
given alone it is evident that while albumen in itself
does not excite secretion the products of albumen do cause
this secretion the same is tnie of pieces of bread
which when placed in the large stomadi throueh the fistula
will not promote a secre tion out if the dog
is allowed to swallow the bread secretion begins and continues
for sev eral hours psychic secretion therefore is a preparatory
secretion transforming substances which otherwise wonid not stimulate the stom
ach into such forms as can accomplish this stimulation the
fact that bread will cause a secretion when chewed and
swallowed and not wdicn placed directly in the stomach through
the fistula may be interpreted as by pawlow and peter
borisofi as proving die secretion of a stric juiee under
psychic influence but as will be shown presently it may
be doe to a special body formed in the salivary
glands and reaching the blood eventually circulates through the glands

foimd to accelerate the action of the gastric juice increasing
its digestive power further more it was demonstrated that the
stomach is capable of distiniiog between lactic huric and hydrochloric
adds and responded to each of these adds with a
varying quantitative secretion as lactic and butyric acids are either
contained in the food as such or are prod ucts
oi gastric fermentation their stimuuting jnfluence on eastric secretion is
of therapeubc importance it is evident therefore not oiuy that
the stomach is extremely delicate in de fecting the composition
of foods and regulat ing the composition of its secretion
correspond ingly but that it can distinguish between vari ous
organic acids these experiments further more gave the clue to
the treatment of gastric secretory disorders not hy drags merely
but by dietetic measures hemmeter found that extracts made from
salivary glands that were removed from ani mals during the
act of chewing when injected into the general circulation of
dogs caused a flow of gastric juice this occurred when

the secretion of the gastric glands owes its digestive power

p6 article by peter borisof detwndence of intestiiud upoo gastric
digestion it is a prevalent opinion among the laity that
the stomach has a marked ab sorptive power this is
a natural consequence of an older error according to which
the stom ach is the chief digestive organ it having
been formerly believed that hy far die jester part of
the oigestive act takes place in the stomach google as
already wdinbted die acttial digestion whtcfa takes place in the
stomacli is insignificant com pared with that which takes place
in the in tcatine later it will be shown here
that the secretion of pancreatic juice depends upon the liberation
from the membrane of duodeotiin or first part of the
bowel of an agent called duodenal secretin another faonnone discovered
by bayliss and starling and that the liberation and secretion
of this aeat depends upon the presence of hydrochloric add
in the gastric chyme so that if this acid is
not present in the chyme as it enters the upper
bowel rtiere can be no normal performance of intestmal di
gestion just as normal gastric digestion de pends upon a
normal condition of the moudi and normal salivary secretion sa
normal in testinal digestion depends upon a hormal stom abaorption
from the stomacb the amount of absotjtion that takes place
from the stomach is surprisingly small water is prac tically
not absorbed at all for it appears that fully 95
to 100 per cent of all water ukcn into the
stomach is passed out into the duodenum and absorbed from
the intestine alcohol and sub stances in solution of alcohol
are readily ab sorbed grapesuear milk canestar aad tnal toee
are absorbed in moderate amounts when they are in aqueous
solution when they are in alcoholic solution larger amounts are
absorbed dextrin and peptones are also taken up rem the
btoraad but in smaller amounts than sugar the amount of
these substances absorbed m creases with the concentration of the
soltitiqn but simultaneously with this absorption in curs a more
or less active secretion of watfcr into the stomach which
secretion increasee or diminishes directly in proportion to the amounts
of the substances absorbed so that under cer tain conditions
it is possible to draw more water out of the
stomach by means of a stom achtube than has been
drunk half an hour igtrevtousy which certainly refutes the assump
tion that water could be absorbed from the stomach and
favors the oidy not absorbed hut that it is actually
se creted into the stomach under certain conditions this conclusion
is of great value in the treat ment of certain
dyspepsias characterized by a weakened condition of the tric muscula
ture for in these the contractile power of the stomach
is not sufficient to expel the water into the bowel
in the proper lime and as water is bulk for
bulk the heaviest substance which the human being takes into
the stomach its reten tion in the stomach bevond a
certain length of time drags down and exhausts the already
attenuated gastric muscntaris and dilutes the al ready weakened ftasfric
secretion therefore in some forms of gastric atony an essential
part of the treatment consists in restricting the amount of
water to the lowest possible requisite or to give it
by means of coloninjections if necessary for a lime at
least or if some f it must be taken by
way of mouth to induce the patient to ke on
his nght side and by means of massage to facilitate
the expulsion of the water from the stomach into the
intestine the gsbtric peristalris or motor func tion of the
stomach this is perhaps the most important function of the
stomadi for not only does the motor function mix and
chnm up the gastric contents bnt it expels them at
vol u 43 the proper time into the bowels an
animal might hve without a gastric secretion or with a
stomach which could not absorb anything but it could not
live with a stomach that had no peristalsis the muscular
layer of the stom ach is much thicker and stronger
at the pyloric end which is near the outlet toward
the in testine than at the cardiac end which is
the dilated rounded pouch extending in the oppo site dtrectton
the cardiac end of the stomach is therefore mostly quiet
dtmng the digestive act and the principal gastric movements of
churning and expulsion dccur in the pyloric end where the
muscles are strongest according to oppel the cardiac or quiet
end of the stom ach m certain animals like the
horse pig and rat is functionally distinct from the ptoric
end it is lined fay a different kind of epdielium
called pavement epthelium and its ndgt hava no acid secretion
accordingly this miiet region is even under normal conoitious ine
seat ot active starch digestion it has beoi thougbtt that
inasmuch as the starchconverting agency of the saliva could not
act in the presence of an add like that of
the gastric secretion there fore all starch digestion was arrested
in the stomach and was not resumed until the food
reached the intestine that this is not the case is
shown by w b cannon who jiroved that in man
as in other animals the cardiyc end of the stomach
serves chiefly for starch diges tion by the action of
the salivary ptyalin dur ing the early part of digestion
in the stomach american journal of physiotegy vol vi p
396 this again emphasizes the importance of thorough mastication for
only thereby can the food be thoroughly penetrated bp the
saliva and further starch conversion take place in the cardiac
end of the stomach during gastric di gestion the movements
which food undergoes in the stomach during digestion can be
studied by the aid of the xrays an inert and
in soluble substance whjd is capable of cutting off the
xrays must be mixed with the food in order to
make the gastric movements visible before the roentgen apparatus bismuth
sub nitrate answers this purpose admirably even the movements of
the human stomach can be studied by adding this insoluble
substance to the food and placing the individual who has
eaten it before the xray instrument in this wav it
has been discovered that the pyloric or highly muscular portion
of the stomach is the part where the most effective
gastric movements are brought about the movements in the other
portions of the stomach are not of sufficient force to
be noticeable before the xray appa ratus it seems probable
therefore that the fundus or pouch end of the stomach
serves simply fo push the food into the pyloric end
where it is churned to and fro for a while
and eventually expelled into the duodenum three or four mdies
from the exit of the stomadi known as the pylorus
the musculature of the stomach is particularly strongly developed sphincter
muscle of the antrum pylori and here it is that
the stomach may constrict to such an extent as to
partition off a special por tion of the pyloric end
and expel the toad into the duodenum without permitting of
any regurgitation into the fundic end ail this if in
contradiction of the view originally held by beaumont and still
quoted in some of tbc cii ycooglc t4 stouach textbcks
of physialogy namely that there is important things to decide
when an individual a regular circuit of food around the
walls of complains of dvspepsia or of any distress the
gastric cavity pain distention or symptom referable to the stnictureof
the stomach it is impossible stomach is whether the signs
and symptoms to enter here into a consideration of the
micro are really traceable to the stomach or not scopic
structure of the stomach although this for one may have
all the symptoms of gastric disease and yet the stomach
itself may not be abnormal either in structure or function
for instance the stomach may ve rise to abnormal sensations
as a consequence of disease of other organs the organs
which most frequently derange the stomach in this manner are
the heart liver and kidneys even physicians of experience who
have become afflicted with abnormal gastric digestion have i been
at times deceived concem ing the true source of their
malady fully twothirds of all gastric sufferers who come to
special clinics devoted to dis eases of the stomach are
suffer ing not from any primary dis ease of the
stomach whatever but either from a nervous affection of the
stomach or from one of the gastric derange ments that
are secondary to disease of other organs per haps the
most frequent of these disorders are those that are due
to the nervous gastric affection or as they are called
the gastric nruroses to de termine precisely the exact nature
of an affection of the stomach the chemical analysis and

for the proper understanding of its abnormal functioning much is
yet to be learned concerning the cells of the peptic

the different products of the gastric secretion the hydrochloric acid

conceivable that the differ ent ferments of the stomach are

but the cause of the indigestion should if possible be
removed if possible a large amount of natural saliva should
be swallowed after meals often it has been ob served
that with the simple supply of additional saliva caused by
chewing a piece of rubber etc starch indigestion could not
be demon strated in the testmeal although it had existed
before to fothergill is attributed the ning that ermetits are
crutches no doubt many an invalid would prefer walking on
crutches rather than not at all but there are many
crutchwalkers who by modern surgery hare been enabled to throw
awy the crutcfaes ayd tach n walk unaided so with
ihe digestive ferments they may be used with success temporarily
hut the oest thing to do is to discover how
the patient may digest without them and in case of
amylaceous dyspepsia this is accom plished by cure of the
excess of hydrochloric add formation or restoring the lost motor
function of the stomach for when the starchy foods are
retained in the stomach overtime they are very apt to
cause an excessive secre tion or to produce an excessive
amount o organic acid oy fermenting in the stomach imgt
der the insuence of baotena in this connection it becomes
a duty to warn against the use of saccharin as
a substitute for sugar as our leitlon is now enged
in the gigantic struggle to preserve its civilization our government
hag found it necessary to restrict uie sugar consumption so
far fortunately not under the caloric requirements for a human
bein but to sweeten food and drink by sac charm
is a mistake because this substance im pairs the digestive
power of the gastric juice in fact of all digestive
ferments inatmction in cookiaz needed in amer ican schools one
of the chief features in the treatment and also in
the prevention of diseases of the stomach is the avoidance
of improper medication and what is even more important of
unsuitable diet much improve ment is needed in american cooking
and public kitchens and cooldnp schools might be of great
tenefit serious injury is being caused by in sufficient or
improper food instruction in cooking and diet should be given
in all public hools where young girls attend for nine
cut of 10 girls that attend these schools it will
be a greater blessing and they personally will ijrove a
greater blessing to the community if ijiev know how to
prepare a roast boil potatoes and make an omelet or
good bread than if ignorant in these things they can
give the most scholarly translation of virl in europe it
is not considered below the dig nity of daughters of
the highest families even those oirectly connected jith royalty to
attend cooldng schools nor is such an education incompatible with
the best scien ti6c and dassical training so the prevention
of diseases of the stomach demands a wider and more
thorough knowledge of the art of codctng in addition to
this it necessitates a simirier ufe closer adherence to the
laws of nature more freedom from business strain and nervous
tension and above all things the avoid ance of excess
in the use of alcoholic bererages and tobacco patients should
be impressed with the fact that neither drugs nor any
methods of treatment can improve them if they persist in
their bad habits and faulty diet partic ularly must american
business men who with admirable energy but with httle regard
for ifaeir own health persist in work too severe or
tbcif mental and physical constitutions be taught that the prime
factor in their successful treat nent is rest to such
cases mental and physical rest is more essential to recovery
than inedicide or treatment directed to the stcmach anodier factor

of the intestinm or consti paiion this shottld in all
cases o dyspepsia receive proper attention when a person begins
to feel distress after ting or eructates vomiu or has
feelings of oppression fulness or pain in the abdomen and
headaches one of the first igic i bv sjnmatiiu friends
is a drink of some alcoholic beverage usually whiskey ihen
comes the abuse of pep sin very frequently the abuse
of some com bination containing soda and mint or some
widely advertised panacea for the diseases of digestion ah this
b gcnerly bein done in the entire absence of a
correct recognition of the real disease the safest thing for
the patient to do in the absence of a logical
di dosis is to rest the stomach absolutely for 24
i truuvcna pleurdd usut i to 48 hours and not
take any food or medicine whatsoever and thereafter beginning with
the very simplest kind of fooo a small plate of
fanna of strained oatmeal a piece of toast and a
cup of hot milk and limewater pro ceed gradually to
a cup of bouillon and a small slice of lean
boiled beef alccdicri surs rich and fatty substances should be
avoided for oanic diseues of the stemach these are the
various forms of gastritis catarrfi of stomach ulcer carcinoma etc
and the dis placements and enlargements oilatation dis placements gastroptosls
may be congniial or acquired when the stomach is displaced
from its normal position the condition is in the great
majority of cases accompanied with an mfirmity of the neral
nervous system known as nenraethenia qv stiller has liointed out
that this condition in over 80 per cedt of these
cases is attended by the loose or floating 10th rib
normally the 10th rib is altadtcd to the costal cartilages
and these to ac breastbone but whenever the stomach is
disriaced out of its normal position and a very diffused
splashing sound is audible over the abdomen on shaldng the
stomach there is u a rule a very movable or
floating 10th rib dilatations of the stomach may be primary
mechanical interference at the outlet of the stomach or such
interferences are secnndaiy to some obstruction at the outlet the
causes of this obstruction may be scars from old gas
tric ulcers tumors especilly cancers indura tive chronic gastntis or
any petitonitic in ianmatian which may constrict the stomach from
the outside frequently gallstones which result in pericystic inflammation may
constrict the part of the bowel immediately below the stomach
in snch a man ner that it is indistinguishable from
an obstruction of the pylo i rus five such cases
are reported in prcressive uedidne by prof j c hemmcter
gtecenber 1903 p 45 so the cause of a dilated
stomach is not always to be soaghi within the stomach
itself a knowledge of displacements fand dilations of the stomach
neces sarily precludes a knowledge of its normal position this
is airably depicted in the accompanying illus trations where it
is seen that the larger end of the stomach or
the blind pouch may extend higher than the fifdi rib
ltm the left side thus reaching up behind the apex
of the heart this readily ex plains the distress felt
about the heart and also the irritable heart action in
some forma of gastric dishirbance the dorsal view of this
illustration also shows the cor rect or normal relations of
the 10th rib just referred to in connec tion with
gastroptosls when the 10th rib is detached or floating its
tip sticks out like that of the llih rib in
this illustration the same illustrations also demonstrate the anatomical fact
that only a very small portion of the stom ach
is palpable through the soft part of the abdominal wall
when it is in normal posi tion because the larger
part of it is concealed under the ribs and under
die liver so that the simple fact that we can
see or feel a lare part of the entire stomach
projecting through the abdominal wall when it is distended is
a suffi cient evidence that the stomach is out of
place the stomach can be made visible through the abdominal
wall by distending it artificially with carbon dioxide by means
of an effervescent mixture containing tartaric acid and bicarbonate of

development of prehistoric man kind when stone bone shells and

implements the term first came into recognized use by the
publication in 1865 of prehistoric times written by sir john
lubbock lord avebury who compiled and set in order the
discoveries made in france and elsewhere during the previous half
century he classified the prehistoric period into three divisions namely
iron age when bronze copper and stone were superseded by
iron in most instruments and weapons continuing to the present
bronte age preceding the use of iron when bronze was
the predominant intil n r its close no metal v
the stone age was further divided bj lubbock into 1

more recent time of polished stone im plements this classification
persists but further collection of materials has enabled archaeologists to
define several subdivisions especially in the paleolithic part mahdng snccessive

elsewhere continued in ignorance of either in fact savage peoples
in remote corners of the world remain in the stone
age to the present time and will continue to do
so indefinitely except for such improvements as they may adopt
from more enlightened neighbors the succession of stages in cultural
evolution to be outlined in this article never theless accords
with the truth as applied to any one region or
race because there is never a retrogression from a higher
to a lower stage at the same time it seems
probable that the significant advances were not often if ever
by slow evolution but rather were owing to the conquest
and occupation of each country by fifrangers bringing some superior
degree of culture pblfoiithic or old stoiie age it is
hardly century since the chance finding of an arrowhead unmistakably
of human work manship ie an artifact deep in the
gravel of the somme valley in france led to an
immediate and lively interest in the new science of prehistoric
anthropology and to extended explorations not only in france but
all over the world this soon restilted in large col
lections of objects picked up on the surface taken from
various depths in riversands and graveldeposits or found in caves
peatbogs grave etc these were attentively studied not only with
reference to material form and possible purpose but in the
light of geography arid geology in order to determine thdr
rel ative age the determination of the geological position in
which each relic was found was particularly important the genera
result of 50 years of study has been the perception
and arrangement of the following series of culture groups or
stages within the paleolithic period numbered from the oldest 1
to the most recent lt8 4 mousterub a brief account
of the geological record is here necessary in order to
place the earliest traces of man in the stone age
id proper perspective all readers are probably acquainted with the
fact that an era of intermittent glaciation that in its
maximum effects covered nearly all of the northern hemisphere with
an arctic climatt and riiick ice intervened between the close
of the tertiary pleibtocene division and the beginning of the
quaternary era which latter immediately preceded the present conditions this
glacial period as it is termed is now known to
have been not continuous but to have had at any
rate in europe three breaks during which intervals the ice
disap peared and a mild climate prevailed this melioralion was
most marked following the second iceperiod when for an iimnensely
long time both europe and north america were restored to
a climate and appearance not greatly different from the present
forests and vegetation were much the same as now and
most of the animals with the addition perhaps implying a
somewhat warmer climate eolithic relicb in geological fomtations of this
eolithic time have been found rudely diipped and hammered stones
that are regarded by most archxologists as true artifacts and
are called eoliths it is very likely that some of
them are really of human haniuworlc and it is believed
by man persons that an indica tion of their makers
is given by the discovery in 1907 deep in a
gravclbed near piltdown in kent england of a broken fossilized
skull having human characteristics piltdown is on a plateau abounding
in eolithic flints and broken pebbles this skull has been
the subject of intense study and discussion all its features
as well as the brain capacity denote a being inferior
to any other prehistoric race known but its relationship to
them or to the more recent inhabitants of the glooe
remains unde termined it is not in fact fully conceded
to be anything but the braincase of an anthropoid ape
these rude relies of the dawn of humanity mark the
prechellean stage and die situation implied would be dubious were
it not that in some places the accompanying imple ments
arc convincingly of human workman ship and were it not
that an indubitable relic of a human frame has been

which is the oldest or earliest known repre sentative of
the human race this heidelberg man homo keidelbergensit had many
apelike features but he was unmistakably human and his period
is estimated at 250000 years ago prechelleans this long warm
period was followed by one of great aridin changii latterly

the glaciers again retreated and a third warm scaee re
newed livable conditions throughout the north temperate zone so that
southern europe and northern africa again became occupied by human
inhabitants they were nomadic sav ages no doubt wandering along
the river courses and they possessed so little ingenuity that
they were able to improve very little the shapely pebbles
or accidentally fractured flints and other sbarpltedgcd stones that thty
picked up and tried to use as aids to their

superior in botli form and variety of utility to those
of the cbellean and reprcbcnt a really remarkaue advance in
intellectuality and in breadth of life this adieujian period was
brought lo an end slowly but steadily by the approach
of the fourth recurrence of glacial cold in europe after
a third intcrglacial prechcllean inabikiy to the excdlence of acfaeuuan
productions which imply a very con siderable elevation above a
mere animal cooling climate of adieulian times bat and greatest
glacial period when one icecap covered all kurope north of
the baltic and another spread far outward from the alps
and the climate was of course exceed ingly cold this
is the reindeer period of the older writers on prehistoric
anttquities a came suitable enough since that and other boreal
animah characterized the semiarctic fauna of all the north temperate
zone during this cold time estimated to have lasted 25000
years man continued to exist in what is termed the
mouslerioh stage of culture but under the hard conditions of
life at that dme mankind deteriorated judking by the inferiority
of his tools as compared with those of his acheulian
predecessors his relics are found most abundantly in southern europe
and in caves which were then 6rst resorted to as
permanent human habitations the wintry weather drinng men to seek
their snug shelter the mousterian then is the true caveman
what he was like is known from a great ntmiber
ot skulls and other parts of skeletons exhumed from cavefloors
and other subterranean deposits of this time the first important
find of the kind was in 1856 in a grotto
in the neanderthal neander valley near dusseldorf rhenish prussia but
since then skulls and other bones in excellent preservation have
been procured at canstatt in germany spy in belgium sipka
in moravia krapina in croatia and at many places in
southern france especially in the caves at le moustier in
dordogne from which the period derives its name neandertiial cavedwellcra
southern france a limestone region is honeycombed with caves see
caverdwellota and seems to have been the most populous centre
of the neanderthals qv an intermediate race that extended from
england to hungary at least and were the tjrpical savage
of paleolithic limes they were men of a species homo
manderlhaltnaii superior to the heidelberg type of chellcan limes possibly
theirancestor but retained apelike characteristics and cer tainly were far
inferior in phvsique as in mind to the neolithic men
presently to be described the skull of the neanderthal man
was chai acterized by an extremely recedine forehead by the
great ridgu of bone above the eves a massive jaw
wim littk chin and very strong teeth and diewinpmuscles indicatink
that these ancient people were meatcaters they were men of
stocty robust frames averaging about five feet and four inches
in height but they had not yet acquired a fully
erect attitude ol body the relics of the earlier part
of the mous terian period show little advance over the
pre ceding culture but bter the increased employ ment al
the sharp knifelike flinthake re touched on one side only
is observable and a eradual increase in the making of
different huntingweapons and of small awls scrapers and so forth
of stone and bone and of needles necessary to sewing
the skin clothing re quired in the colder weather of
that time as compared with the era of their remote
fore fathers is it not possible that the improve ment
noted may be the result of the greater wants to
be filled and energy requiredtnereby owing to the increased diulty
of maintaining existence and comfort in a cold world no
evidence that these cavemen had or knew of the bow
and arrow has et come to light as the glaciers
of this mousterian period of cold which lasted many thousands
of years melted returning warmth of climate ititraducei the postglacial
conditions that with minor changes have continued to the present
ii was at this juncture that the neanderthal race came
to an end and did so with a relative suddenness
that is astonishing the latest student of the matter prof
h f osborn regards il as a case ot the
complete extinction of a species so far as we know
at present he declares the neanderthals were entirely eliminated no
trace of the survival of the pure neanderthal ance ends
he mousterian stage and the lower paleolithic period the upper
paleolithic in the strata over lying that in which the
relics of the mousterian or caveman culture are found lie
the evi dences of a new and different kind of
industry which introduces the upper paleolithic division of the old
stone age this is known as the aungnacian culture and
is attributed to the immigration into western europe of a
race of men probably from the southeast as aurignacian relics
are found on all the shores around the mediter ranean
sea the inroad of these fordgn and betterarmed people was
followed by the destruction of the race of cavemen whose
rtoftoes and rock shelters were adopted as homes by thetr
conquerors ttiis happened it is believed between 25000 and 30000
years ago who were these stransers whence did they come
it is believed that they were asiatics who had slowly
worked their way westward chiefiy if not whcy along tlie
southern shore of the mediterranean into and beyond spain they
were true men homo tapietu not intenaediate in stracttire and
khility between htmian and simian as were thor predecessors m
europe in short aey are the ancestors of a large
part of die men of today and it is unfortunate
that they arc not known by a better name tfian
cromagnons die designation of the cave in etordogne france where
their firstknown skeletons wera obtained they were tall wellbuilt men
with heads long fore and aft dolichocephalic and d google
with broad f ices pleasing features and well developed chins
probably the complexion of the skin was dark they were
men of large brains a race in osborns opinion capable
of ideas of reasoning of imagination and more hily endowed
with artistic sense and ability than any unciviliied race which
has ever been discovered a large volume would be needed
to describe thoroughly all of their industrial and social life
as shown by the relics of the four successive stages
of culture into which paragraphs the cromagnons the cromagnons were
essentially hunters living on the flesh of wild beasts including
the mammoth an extinct rhi noceros elasmothere aurochs wild horse
and other animals of the forests and plains they dwelt
