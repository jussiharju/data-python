remained in the cabinet of presi dent johnson and in
the struggle between the president and congress over the policy
of reconstruction sympathized with congress he felt that the presidents
policy meant the return of the disloyal element to power
in the southern states and he conid not contemplate such
a re sult without indignation the partisans of the president
demanded his resignation while the leading republicans besought him to
remain feeling that his presence in the war depart ment
was an insurance against violence his posiiion was extremely disagreeable
but he held it with persistent courage taking no part
in the discussion and making no public expression of his
views he simply remained at his post and discharged his
duty the tenure of office act had been passed in
part to prevent the removal of stanton he opposed its
passage advised the president to veto it and desired its
defeat after the veto this act and the provision that
the president should issue orders to the army only through
the general of the army effectually took e control of
the army away from the president and he wished to
regain it when congress adjourned in the summer of 1867
the president sounded general grant as to removing stan ton
from office grant counseled him against it thereupon the president
asked for stan tons resignation which was refused and the
refusal was applauded by the republican lead ers a week

cause and di rected him to turn over all public

the trial of the president followed and ended on the

been nominated to the cabinet as secretary of war when
the senate failed to convict the president stanton at once
retired and the nomination of schofield was confirmed he left
the oflicc which he had held for more than six
years a comparatively young man but broken in health by
the unremitting toil and anxiety which he had undergone his
income which had been considerable when he took office had
been so reduced that he had aothing but his house
in washittgton and he was obliged to resume the practice
of his pro fession he argued several important cases but
his powers were exhausted and he gradually failed his last
argument was made at a hear ing in his own
library in december 1869 and he never left the house
again the approaching resignation of judge grier made a prospective

starspangled banner the a patriotic song composed by francis scott
key 14 sept 1814 and now recognized throughout the united
states as the national anthem al though it is not
such in legal fact congress having repeatedly rejected proposals one
as recently as 1914 to make a declaratidn to that
effect by resolution nearly 100 years after it was written
the song was prescribed by formal orders to be played
in the army and navy on occasions ot ceremony and
that is the extent of its osidal recognition today foreigners
have long believed the star spangled banner to be the
fully accepted national anthem of america and in their armies
and navies and on all public occasions when it is
desired to honor america in music abroad the familiar air

determination to take arms in defense of the national honor

the utmost con sideration and was promptly released when the
attack ended when he waa rowed ashore on the morning

least 32400 it is found in almost every plant at
some period of its hfchisiory and is especially abundant in
wheat potatoes arrowroot and other similar kinds of vegetation and
forms a very large and important part of the food
of man and the herbivorous animals it occurs in the
ovule of the seed in the cotyledons of the embyro
in the pith the bulbs stems and notably in the
roots and tubers of certain families of plants as the
potato sweet potato cassava etc the starch granules are found
in the growing plant in the protoplasm of the chlorcqihyll

greatest numbers toward evening ana fewest in the morning sometimes
disappearing entirely during the night appearing at first as simple
jioints they gradually increase in size so that eventually they
ill completely the chlorophyll corpuscle the latter appearing as simply
an envelope for the starch the starch granules grow and
increase in size only when in contact with protoplasm and
under conditions of ex posure to light at a favorable
temperature and m the presence of carbon dioxide these gran
ules are of widely varying sizes in different plants ranging
from a diameter of 00069 inch in the canna and
00055 inch in the potato to 00003 inch in the

nucleus the outer ones being the denser inasmuch as these
layers or envelopes are of variable thickness they cause the
granule to assume more or less a flattened ovoid form
occasionally there are two nuclei within the outer envelope each
surroimded with its own series of concentric layers the outer
layer is the first formed and is known as starch
cel lulose the interior is called granulose these two substances
may be separated by ap propriate chemical action starch dried
at ordinary temperatures always retains an amount of water varying
from 12 to 16 per cent but try drying in
a vacuum over sulphuric acid and gradually raising the temperature
to 212 f it may be obtained perfectly free from
water but if it be boiled with water the starch
gran ules are swollen and broken up so that on
cooling a stiff gelatinous mass starchpaste is produced on largely
diluting this paste with water the swollen granules for the
most part subside but a considerable quantity of starch re
mains in solution by boiling starch mixed with a quantity
of water under pressure at a tem perature of about
300 f ltts mostly dissolved and on filtering the liquid
and allowing it to cool small granules ot starch are
deposited which are slightly soluble in cold water and are
at once dissolved by water heated to 160 this modification
of starch is known as soluble starch the simplest method
of making soluble starch is to dissolve it in hot
glycerine starch may be detected by btnling the suspected sub
stance with water cooling and adding tinc ture of iodine
when if starch be present a fine deep blue color
is produced this color is dissipated by heat or by
substances such as alcohol ether etc which dissolve and so
re move the iodine nitric acid acts on starch in
different ways according to the strength of the acid used
and the temperature cold conceitt rated nilnc acid forms a
substitution product in which one hy drogen atom of the
starch is replaced by the group noi a mixture of
concentrated nitric and sulphuric acid gives rise to the formation
of a dinitrosubstitution product in which two atoms of hydrogen
are rmlaced by the group no twice hot nitric acid
converts starch into oxalic malic and acetic adds acted upon
for 24 hours by a 12 per cent solution of
hydro chloric acid the starch becomes soluble in water without
forming a paste preparation of starch with regard to the
purposes to which starch b applied the vari ous icinds
may be divided into 1 starches used for food and
2 starches used for laundry and other industrial purposes ihoukh
certain kinds are extensively used under ioth of these heads
in their chemical relations all varieties of starch are identical
but in their physical con stitution and microscopic structure they
present d google matked diflereiices and tht also vary much
as regards distibility ajid suitableness as articles of food the
size of these granules and the arrangement of layers differ
in every different species of plant and therefore the source
of any particular starch is readily determined iy microscopic examination
starch may be pun fied by freeiing a 1 per

embrace arrowroot tous lesmois sago and tapioca comsiarch which has
an enorowus sale is simply the starch of indian com
or maize separated mechanically from the grain the process most
commonly in use in the uniied stales is known as
the sulphur dioxide process the grain is steeped in a
i per cent aqueous solution of sulphur dioxide at a
temperature of 250 to 300 f for from two to
four days the swelled grains while wet are then crushed
between cylinders under a flow of water washing the mass
through a cylindrical sieve so as to sqarate out the
husky matter the milkuke fluid which contains the starch in
suspension passes through he sieve and is run along a
series of gently inclined surfaces on which the heavier granules
are deposited the lifter and finer particles being carried with
nitrogenous matter into scttlingtanks the deposit which acctunnlatei in the
settlingtank is purified by repeated straining and settling and the
separated stardi is dried by gentle artificial heat when it
crum bles to a powder and as such it is
packed for the market starch for indtutrial purposes is obtained
also frltmn potatoes wheat and rice and sago starch is
extensively ctnplayed for other than food purposes stardi from many
different substances finds occasional of limited employ ment potatoes affected
by disease yield as pure and useful a stanji as
sound tubers but much less in proportion to their weight
as the uscase usually results in the transmutation of starch
to sugar on a small scale the prepara tion of
stardi from potatoes is a simple opei ation the tubers
have simply to be thoroughly waed to free them from
all earthy impurity then rasped down to a fine pulp
in a tub of water and allowed to settle when
the starch will fait to the bottom and the greater
part of the skin or husk will float on the
water by repeated washing and settling of the starchy deposits
the starch may be obtained in a con dition of
purity and it may then be dried by gentle heat
for preservation and use on the manufacturing scale machincty of
various kinds is adapted for performing the several processes of
steeping and washing straining out of stones rasping straining settling
puri fying draining and drying which the potatoes undergo some
manufacturers pass the rasp ings flirough a grinding mill resulting
in an increase of starch product by 8 to 12
ler cent beyond its use in industrial pursuits in com
mon with other starches potatostarch is much employed for making
imitation sago for adul terating and as asubstitute for the
more costly food starches for preparing starchsugar and as a
source of potatospirit wheatstarch is prepared by two distinct processes
by the first and dd method the grain is subjected
to a process of fermentation whereby the gluten or nitrogenous
constituent of the wheat is rendered soluble and the remain
der of it loses its adhesive property and in this
condition the starch is easily separated out by a washing
wheel or drum by this process the greater part of
the gluten is wasted and a smaller yield of starch
is obtned than can be secured by the more recent
system of martin the principle on which the tatter proceeds
can be easily illustrated by making a dou of flour
placing it in a muslin bag and squeezing it under
the water when the starch exudes min gling with the
water and setdiug as a sediment leaving within the muslin
a gray semielastic mass consisting chiefly of gluten in this
way the gluten is saved and can be utilized for
cattlefeeding etc the production is two pounds of scardt for
each pound of gluten by whatever process prepared wheaten starch
is purified by repeatm washing and settling and dried by
gentle heat and on drying it assumes the columnar slraeture
by which it is familiarly known in the preparation of
ricestarch a i e referred for laundry purposes the grain
e steeped in a slightly alkaline solutiot lety count of
its peculiarly hard and homy envelope of gluten in addition
to being extensively used in laundries starch is largely consumed
in the manufacture of dextrin qv and it is also
employed as a thickener in calicoprinting and in the finishing
of bleached and printed caticoes placed in a 2 per
cent solution of soda or potash the granules swell forming
a tenacious paste used by photographers for mounting prints and
for many other purposes dry starch finds a valuable minor
adaptation in dusting molds in metal casting besides being applied
for toany miscellaneous purposes statiaticb in the united states in
1914 there were 82 starch factories having an in vested
capital of 12070000 there were 1780 persons employed and the
total value of the product for the year was 13996000
in this production new york ranked first indiana sec ond

canals and polian vesicles besides the sexual mode of reproduction
star fishes possess the power of regenerating lost parts developed
to so great a degree that it amounts to a
sexual reproduction when han dled or injured they will often
automatically cast off an arm or even all of the
arms close to the base not only will the disc
regenerate any number or all of its arms when lost
but in some cases the single arms will develop new
discs thus producing several individuals from one experimental cuttings of
starfishes has shown how bifurcated or extra arms may be
as it seems probable that one or more arms could
thus often escape capture this capacity for regeneration jv combined
with their tenacity of life and enormous fecundity prob ably
accounts for the surpassing numbers in which they sometimes occur
all starfishes are marine and most of them rve in
comparatively shallow water ihotigh a few extend to at and
many to moderate depths as fossils they occur in most
forma tions from the cambrian upward but are much less
numerous than the seaurchins being less well adapted by their
structure for preserva tion while the number of arms is
generally five or some multiple of five some genera bear
irrelar numbers as 13 in solaslrr 9 lo 13 in
brismffa or upward of 20 in hetiaster while a few
as culcita and aerucm ar pentag onal and nearly without
trace of arms starfishes are voracious creatures which feed for
the most part upon mouusks including such large bivalves as
ousters the manner in which they accomplish this apparently impossible
feat is very remarkable by means of the suckers at
the ends of the lubefeet the starfish attaches part of
its arms io each valve of the oyster and by
a steady continuous traction sooner or later so weakens die
adductor muscle of the latter that the valves gape open
as the mouth is too small to admit the boay
of the oyster the stom ach is protruded and enwrapping
its prey the soft body is gradually sucked through the
mouth small gastropods may be taken into the mouth entire
many species of starfishes lives on the bottom in vast
shoals and althou slugfish creatures they often migrate to new
feeding grounds moving over the ground steadily in a definite
direction the bestknown starfishes of our atlantic shores are the

latter south of cape cod thou both are found in
vineyard sound and the neighboring waters they are nearly akke
reach a diameter of 12 or 15 indies aad extend
from low water to considerable depths both species congregate in
great numbers on mussel and oyster beds often committing great
havoc on the latter they are removed from the latter
by the boa load by means of dredges and tangles
and cast ashore formerly the oystermea brce them into pieces
which were cast into the water in expecttttimi of killing
them with the result that their numbers were increased greatly
the smooth starfish cribrtua stuiffuinolenia is a very prety small
shallow water species with five long round nearly smooth arms

all the heavenly bodies which look like points of lit
this designation includes five of the planets mercury mars venus
jupiter and saturn in scientific language the term is ap
plied onl3r to those bodies which seem fixed on the
celestial sphere and are therefore termed ed ttors these are
immense incandescent dies scattered through the immensities of space at
distances which beggar alt our con ceptions in accordance with
the general plan of the present work we begin with
a study of the stars as tbey appear to us
and then pass to the consideration of their actual constitution
and situation in space we shall therefore supjmse the reader
to scan the heavens at night while we point out
certain features of the scene of grandeur then presented to
his vision the first feature to be noticed is the
great diversity in the brightness of the stars or to
use a technical expression in their magnitudes these range all
the way from that of the bright est stars down
to the point of invisibility to the naked eye the
smallest telescope will show scores of stars too faint to
be seen without its aid and the greater the power
of the instru ment the greater the number that will
be brought into view without any limit yet known the
ancient astronomers divided the stars into six orders of magnitude
called the first second etc the is or 20 brighter
stars were classified as of the first magnitude those a
grade below them as of the second and so on
until they came to the sixth which comprised the faintest
stars visible to the unaided eye al these stars are
now called lucid fainter ones ultscopic in modern times the
preceding sys tem of magnitudes has not only been extended
to the telescopic stars but has been arranged on a
plan which gives greater precision and enables us to designate
the exact measure of the light which we receive from
a star by its magnitude the magnitudes of stars are
now designated to tenths or to give greater precision even
to htmdredths of a magnitude thus we have stars of
magnitudes 30 31 32 etc these numbers are arranged on
a dimmishing scale of light so that a difference of
one magnitude corresponds to the multiplies means that a star
of magnitude 30 is about two and a half times
as brit as one of magnitude 40 this again about
two and a half times as brigfal as one of
magnitude 50 etc the exact scale is such that a
star of the first magnitude is precisely 100 times as
bright as one of die sixth while the latter is
100 times as bright as one of thellth so that
an increase of five units in the scale of magnitude
corresponds to a division of the light by 100 careful
examination will also show diat flie stars of each magnitude
are several times as numerous as those of the brighter
magnitudes there are three or four times as many stars
of the fourth magnitude as of the third three or
four times as many of the fifth as of the
fourth and so on in nearly geometrical progression but when
we pass to tne stars invisible to the naked eye
the progression is not so rapid yet its common ratio
does not fall below two at any point yet known
the result is that the stars of the fter magnitudes
are to be counted by millions the faintest stars visible
in the largest telescopes are about of magni tude 17
or 18 another familiar feature of the sky is that
the stars are not scattered uniformly but that the brighter
ones appear to be collected to a greater or less
extent into constellations there is however no precise dividitig line
between one constellation and another hie irregularity is such that
the number of constellations is somewhat arbitrary the fainter the
stars the less marked is the division into constellations the
telescopic stars cannot be divided into constellations at all see
constellations careful cservation shows that the stars differ slightly in
color it is true that the colors are less marked
than those of natural objects there being no such red
as the ruhy and no such bright green as the
emerald among the d google stars but there is a
regular gnidatkni from a yellowish red through white to a
wellmarked bluish tint these differences of color are supposed to
indicate different degrees of tetn perature of the stars or
different periods in their growth and development number of stan
the whole number of stars in the heavens visible to
the naked eye is about 5000 as onehajf of these
are neces larily below the horizon at any one time
it fol lows that not more than 2500 can be
seen at once but this is greater than the actual
num ber visible under ordinary conditions because small stars near
the horiiou are rendered dim or invisible by the diickness
of the air through which we see them practically it
is not likely that more than 2000 stars can ever
be seen at once by the best eye unless at
elevated points where the air is very clear down to
the horisoa up to the present time it has been
impossible to make anyuiine like au enumeration of the telescopic
stars mcause as we luve already said every increase in
the power of the tele scope bnns out new stare
that otherwise would be invisible there is however no doubt
that the stars visible in a large telescope are to
be counted by tens of millions it is now found
that stars can be photographed with a large telescope which
are so small that the eye would not perceive them
in the telescope itself it is probable that the whole
number found on the best photographic plates amounts to more
than 100000000 but we must not suppose that this nuiifr
would actually comprise all the stars in the sky although
in some direc tions we seem to luve reached the
limit of the visible stars we do not know when
the entire heavens is considered how many fainter stars there
may be for every one that can be pho tographed
a very recent estimate fixes the total number of the
stars at 1600000000 but this is as yet necessarily very
uncertain the mil way another feature of the sky connected
with the stars is the milky way or galaxy this
really stupendous though not striking object can be seen at
some hour of any night in the year its position
in the sky dejiending on the season in our latitudes
it is quite near partly below the horizon during the
evenings of may and is then not readily seen but
even then it may be seen later in the evening
at the proper time on any night it e asses
nearly through the zenith spanning the eavens like a complete
arch resting on two opposite points of the horizon galileo
pointing his first telescope 10 the sky found that this
object was composed of congeries of stars too faint to
be separately visible this fact has been abundantly proved by
modem observations a very little study of the sky without
a telescope will show that the milky light of these
stars is by no means uni form but is frequently
gathered into clouds these show that the milky way is
in part made up of vast poups or collections of
stars rather irregular in form the asct of the milky
way is also very different in different arts of its
course one of its most remarkable eamres is best seen
in summer and autumn it will then be noticed that
in the region of the tenith the milky way seems
to be divided into two separate streams with a comparatively
dark space between them this seeming cleft ex tends toward
the south nearly to the celestial equator where one of
the screams brandies off toward the west and comes to
an end while the other continues on its course it
will also be noticed that at some points of its
course the galaxy is narrow ana well defined while in
others notably in the extreme south it is wide and
diffuse many astronomers have occupied themselves in mating photographs of
various portions of the milky way barnard has used a
large camera for this purpose and in several obser vatories
the brest telescopes have been so employeid one curious feature
is brought out by these photographs in that part of
the milky way which in autumn is seen between the
celestial equator and the southern horizon numerous clefts and vacant
spaces occur as though there were actual openings through the
mass of stars this fact seems to show that the
thickness of the milky way or the distance through which
the line of sight extends when we look at it
is less here dian elsewhere going farther south into regions
invisible in our northern latitudes other vacant spaces are found
known as coatsaeks but it is found that stars really
exist in these spaces though they are comparatively few and
faint another feature of the southern hemisphere comprises two patches
of light called the ua gellarfic clouds these are situated
at some distance from the milky way and yet seem
to be of the same general nature as the utter
they may be described as two outlying collec tions of
very faint stars it is found by careful observation and
count that the stars of any magnitude seem to be
rather thicker in the region of the galaxy than elsewhere
the smaller the stars the greater the thickness in and
near the galaxy becomes so that it is probable that
a large majority of the very faint stars belong to
the milky way several other peculiarities connected with stars of
the milky way will be better understood after ne have
described certain varying char acteristics of he stars naming the
surs most of the brighter stars not only those of
the first and second magnitude but a few remarkable ones
of fainter magnitudes had special names assigned to them in
ancient and medieval times the oldest and best known of
all these names is arclurus which is found in the
book of job the names of castor and pollux were
also assigned in classic antiquity to the two brightest stars
in the constellation gemini or the twins but most of
these special names are derived from designations given by the
arabs which were supposed to express some pecuhariiy of the
star there are also quite modern names polaris for example
which designates the pole star during the past three centuries
most of these names have been to a greater or
less extent replaced by a system of designating the brighter
stars in all the constellations which was intro duced by
bayer about 1600 he assigned to the principal stars in
each constellation the let ters of the greek alphabet alpha
beta gamma etc commonly the first letter of the alphabet
is assigned to the brightest star and the prog ress
of the letters indicates to a certain extent the successive
orders of brightness in the same constellation but this rule
was not uniformly carried out frequently the successive lttcn dgt
google for ex ample in the familiar constellation of the
great bear the grst six letters of the alphabet are
ap plied to the consecutive stars whien make up the
dipper the greek alphabet noi being sufq cient for all
the stars letters of the koman alphabet are used when
the greek one is ex hausted flam stead astronomer royal
at greenwich two centuries ago adopted the plan of numbering
the stars in each constellation any such system however is
imperfect and taken altogether there is a lack of uniformity
in the meuiod of designating the stars except the brighter
ones the followinft are a few of the brighter and
bestknown stars which have wellkno alphu oriodu ajphi aisus cuinn

when the spectro scope was invented and applied one of
the first uses made of it was to analvze the
light coming from various stars in order to see in
what respect they differed in their conslilution the result has
been to show that out of several thousand stars which
have been examined in detail it can hardly be said
that any two are exactly alike it is true in
the highest branch of sciedce that one star diflereth trom
another star not onl in glory but in the substance
which makes it up as well as in various other
features at the present time the spectra of the stars
are best studied by means of photog raphy the general
fact that lights can be photographed whidh are too faint
to be visible to the eye is here applied with
great success when only eye methods were used ii was
hardly possible to accurately define or measure the spectral lines
given by any but the brihtest stars and even here
the measures were so un certain that few definite results
were reached but by applying photography the negative on which
the spectrum is impressed can be placed under a measuring
engine and the settings made by means of a microscope
with the highest de gree of precision that admits of
beink reached at an early period of spectroscopic dis covery
secchi the roman astronomer made an exact classification of the
spectra of stars which he connected with their respective colors
the bluish stars he designated as of the first type
those which were almost pure white or slightly yellowish were
of the second type while those approaching toward red were
mostly of the third type speaking in a rough way
it would seem that these gradations correspond to tbr absorption
of the light by atmospheres ndiiuc all the stars the
more dense and the deeper this atmosphere the more blue
light it absorbs and the more red the remaining light
appears it seems therefore to be a general rule tlhat
the redder stars have the densest and most absorbing atmosphere
from many such stars a large part of the blue
and green light is cut off this deficiency in die
blue light may also be due in some cases to
the stars which show it being not so hot as
the others because we know that the hotter an object
the more blue light it radiates in proiwr tion to
its red light but everything we know of the stars
leads us to believe that these cases are exceptional a
very remarkable fact in connection with this classification is that
the blue or first type largely predominates in the stars
of the milky way while stars distant from the milky
way mostly belong to the other two types quite possibly
it may be found that this distinction wijl enable us
to determine in what part of the universe a star
is situated by means of its spec trum when at
harvard observatory the spec tra of the stars were photographed
on a large scale and the number studied brought up
into the thousands it was found that seccnis classifi cation
was quite insufficient we now have a great number of
such classes designated by letters of the alphabet and numerals
which are too technical to be set forth in the
present article we shall mention but a single type known
as orion stars because many of the stars showmg it
belong to the constellation orion a remarkable peculiaritj of this
type is the great number of fine lines in the
spectra many of which do not belong to any taiowa
substance what gives great interest to it is that the
stars which show it belong mostly or entirely to the
milky way and have markedly slower proper motions than the
stars in general one result of spectral analysis is that
most of the stars are composed in the main of
the same chemical elements which we know to exist upon
the earth iron calcium and hydro gen seem to be
present throughout the whole universe of stars it cannot yet
be said with certainty to what extent elements unknown on
the earth exist in the stars for the reason that
the spectrum of an element depends so much upon the
conditions of pressure or temperature to which the substance is
exposed we may regard it as certain that whether elements
un known to us do or do not exist in
the stars the substances which form the stars and especially
the nebulk exist in many cases in a form dif
ferent from any we have yet produced in the laboratory
proper motionb of th stan one of the most remarkable
features of the universe is that every socled fixed star
is moving for ward on an imdeviating path which so
far as we can yet determine is a straight line
this is called the proper motion of the star noth
ing is better calculated to give us an idea of
the extent of the universe than the contrast be tween
the speeds of these motions as we know that they
really are and the apparent speeds as we observe them
from the earth the actual speed is enormous when compared
with any that we can produce by artificial means the
speed of a shot from the most powerful gun that
can be made can scarcely if at all exceed d
google half a mile per second but if the motien
of anv star u as slow as one mile a
second it it only in very rare and exlraordinary cases
the average speed of itae stars is about 20 miles
a second i and tliis motion it must be remem
bered is noi so far as yet determined motion round
and round in an orbit but a straight afaead motion
never relaxing and never swerv ing almost every star therefore
travels hun dreds of nullions of miles every year century
after century and yet so slow do the motions appear
to us that the naked eye can see no change
in the configuration of the constella tions during a period
of thousands of years a remarkable instance of this idnd
is afforded by arcturus which is so far as we
know one of the swiftest moving slars in the heavens
it seems quite certain diat its speed exceeds a hundred
miles a second and it may he much greater than
this and yei if job could again come to life
and stud the constellation boolis in which arcturus is situated
he would scarcely notice any change in its appearance there
is not a star in the constellation orion moving so
fast that any change would be noticed by the naked
eye in 100000 years the result is that the motions
in question have been detected only by the most refined
observations of modern times extended through long periods every star
in the heavens aijpears in the same posi tion when
observed night after nighj there are very few in whicli
the astronomer can detect any motion by one vear of
observations accurate determinations ot position commenced with the observations of
bradley astronomer royal of england in the middle of the
18th century who determined the position of more than 3000
of the brighter stars smce his time the position of
several hundred thousand stars have been accurately fixed yet so
small is the apparent proper motion in most cases that
it has actually been delected in the case of only
a few thousand stars even now fliere are scarcely a
hundred stars of vrhich the motions are known to exceed
one second in a year to under stand what this
means we must reflect that it would take b good
eye to see that two stars in the sky 200
seconds apart were not a single object the following is
a list of the stars whose proper motions exceed four
seconds in a cen tury in the first column is

m r a dec igtgih b m j i r
ertjis s sisi it is very remarkaue that only three
of these stars ate visible to the naked e and
these three are below the fourth magnitude it will be
seen that the annual motion of the most rapidly moving
star is less thaa 12 seconds annmdly if this star
were to continue its course round the sky without ever
stoppih it would take it more than 105000 years to
make the circuit of the heavens proper uotion of ifae
sua our sua beinz one of the stars we may
expect that it also has its own proper motion but
this motion cannot be directly observed the only way in
which we can detect it is by the relative motion
of the other stars just as we know that a
rail way train is carrying us along when we sec
houses and trees seeming to pass by us the motion
of the sun was delected by observing thu notwithstanding the
varied directions in which the stars appear to us to
be moving there is an average tendency to move from
a point ia the constellation lyra toward the opposilp regiolti
of the heavens south of sirius these two opposite points
are near ihe milky way though not in il from
this general community of motion we infer hat our sun
carrying the earth and all the bodies of the solar
system with it is moving toward the constellation lyra the
point toward which the motion is directed is called the
solar apex it was formerly supposed to be situated in
the constel lation hercules but more recent investigations have placed
it farther to the east its position is still uncertain
by several degrees and ihere is some difference of opinion
among astron omers as to its exact location but the
best re sults seem to show its position as defined
by right ascension and declination to be about the following
right awsuiim is b 30 m dklination 3j north this
point ia about 4 south of the hrit star lyra
we may therefore s that our scdar system is constantly
journeying toward thai region of the heavens where lyra is
situated star streatoinff the earlier determina bons of the poitif
of the heavens toward which our sun is moving were
all based on the as sumption that there are no
widespread sys tematic motions among the stars themselves that is
that when large numbers of them are considered any general
badcward drift of them aii mnst be the effect scdely
of our own motion tluough space if a considerable number
of tbcnl are moving or streaming together the detbfioination wtji
be rendered inexact by ibis fact although it is undoubtedly
true that the direction and velocity of our motion as
just described are very approximately correct several instance a of
star streaming have recently been discovered ludendors has found that
five of the bright start of ursa uajor though they
appear to us widely 5jgtarated in the sky are moving
together in parallel paths and herttsprung has shown that the
dog star sirius though from our position it seems so
far removed from the others is also moving with them
the coitre of this cluster is about 100 light years
from us sirius only 86 light years away is thus
far out of the centre interesting example was dis vgoogic
500 sti which appear scattered over a considerable area of
the slcy do in fact forrn a globular cluster which
is drifting throu space with a velocity of about 25
miles a second some 800000 years ago this swarm passed
nearest our earth its centre then being 73 light years
away it is now about twice as far away from
us as this and at the expiition of 65000000 years
its 39 scattered bnght stars will be so distant that
th will appear to us as a faint round cluster
about twothirds as large as the full moon a discovery
of more widespread importance however is that of kapteyn who
finds evidence of two very extensive systematic star drifts the
larger being directed toward the star xi ononis and the
other in an opposite direction the cause of this extensive
streaming is not known it has been suggested that it
may arise from a falling in toward the centre of
the outer stars of the doud which surrounds us and
which therefore may change its shape periodically through intervals of
time so great that all other eras hitherto considered in
astronomy shrink to nearly notiiing in com parison radu motion
of tb stra the most wonderful revelations of the spectroscope
re late to the proper motions of the stars and
lead to the measurement of the speed with which a
star is movink to or from our system this speed
is callea its radial motion the possibil ity at determining
it rests on the principle that the wavelength of lit
coming from a star is less when the star is
approaching us and greater when the star is moving awa
from us hence if on measuring the refraction of a
particular ray emitted by a star we find it to
be greater than its rlar value we know that the
star is receding from us and in the omitrary case
that it is approaching us it is very interesting that
these meaiurei agree as nearly as we could expect with
obser vations on the position of the stars as to
the direction in which our solar system is moving moreover
they have enabled campbell to de temune with an approximatioa
to certainty the speed of the motion which is about
tl miles per second the whole solar system and our
earth with it has therefori been pursning a journey through
space during the whole of human history nay for hundreds
of thousands possibly for millions of years even with this
sid and continuous motion it will probably e us half
a million of years to reach the region in which
ve fbe briefest star in the constellation lyra is now
situated the proper motions of the stars naturally suggest uie
idea that these objects all have their proper orbits and
are performinfi revolutions round some centre as the planets do
around the sun the idea of a universe of which
this might be true of a tem in which the
years were counted by millions of our years is very
cap tivating but truth compels us to say that up
to the present time astronomical science fur nishes no sound
basis far the reality of such a system no resemblance
of this sort can be traced moreover the general trend
of science is toward the conclusion that the duration of
the universe though very long is finite and is not
sufficient to enable a star to have made many revolutions
round any centre double 9tana careful watcher of die heavens
will notice that there are several pairs of stars in
the heavens two such objects being so close together as
to suggest that they must have some connection the most
striking case the hyades a vshapel fig l of the
lines of the v are two stars of the third
or fourth magnitude forming a very beautiful pair this pair
is easilv to be seen in some part of the
sky on any clear evening in autumn or winter another
case of the same sort is that of one of
the britest stars in the constel lation capricomus viuble in
summer and au tumn which has a much fainter star
alongside of it a third case is in the constellation
lyra one of whose stars of the fourth magnitude can
be seen by the naked eye to be composed of
two separate stars but only a very good eye can
distinguish them from a single star when the heavens are
scanned with a tele scope it is found that a
great many stars which seem single to the eye really
consist of two such objects in close pronmity sometimes these
are of the same brightness but more com monly one
is much brighter than the other very freauently the small
companion is so faint and so cluise to the large
one as to be tost in the glare of its
light except when very care fully examined bv an experienced
observer sudi pairs are called double stars the first question
suggested by these objects is whether the two stars appear
in such close proximity merely because they chance to be
on the same straight line from us or whether they
are really in each others neighborhood the latter is known
to be the case for two reasons in the first
place these double stars are vastly more numerous than they
would be if their proximity were merely accidental another conclusive
proof is afforded by the fact that b many such
cases the two stars are found to be revolving round
each otter or the small one round ine large one
as the case may be the name binary sysum is
applied to such pairs the most important and interesting conclusion
drawn from the motions of these systems b that the
law of gravitation extends to the stars it is true
that we could scarcely doubt such to be the case
even were no such proof available but it is nevertheless
of interest to have inde pendent evidence of il the
revolution of the two stars round eadi other is in
all respects similar to that of the earth and planets
round the siui or that of the moon round the
earth the time occupied in one revolution may be btit
a few decades and in one instance it is bnt
57 years yet in the vast majority of cases hundreds
or even thousands of years are re quired as exact
observations have only been made on these bodies since the
time of sir wil liam herschel there arc less than
100 of which die orbits and periods are accurately deter
mined thus although the whole number known amounts to upward
of 20000 the deter mination of the ormts goes on
very slowly there are two binary stems of spcdal in
terest because the compamon was first discov ered through its
attraction upon the larger star one of these cases is
the brifffatest star in the heavens sinus about 1840 it
was discovered by compating observations made unce the tiioe da
v google 801 of bdley 1750 thai sirius did not
move forward on the celestial sphere with a uniform and
even motion as the other stars did but that there
was a slight irregularity a few years later a careful
investigation of the obser vations showed that sirius was moving
in a very small orbit with a period of about
so years this made it possible to calculate the orbit
of an unseen companion which moving round the star would
produce the apparent orbital mo tion in 1860 alvan dark
the son and suc cessor of the celebrated maxer of
telescopes in oimbridgeport mass on pointing one of the newly
made great instruments at sirius saw a companion scar he
knew nothing about the computations that had been made on
this ob ject but when his observations were compared with
them this companion was found to lie in the right
mrection to produce the observed ine quality the observations since
made show ttiat it is going round in the orbit
prescribed for it before its discovery the other case is
that of procyon the brightest star in the constellation canis
minor its motion was found to be asected by an
ln equahty somewhat smaller than that of sirius r but
the companion which produced il evaded the scrutiny of the
most careful observers until s found to be moving in
the orbit com puted for it before its discovery as
the power of the telescope has been ill creased closer
binary systems having shorter periods have been continually brought to
lil this raises the question whether there may not be
vast numbers of such systems in which the two stars
are so close togetiier that no telescope will separate them
tis question has been answered in recent times by the
aid of the spec troscope we have already described how
the radial motions of stars or the motion in the
di rection to or from our system is measured by
diis instrument the determinations have been going on since 18s0
as the number of meas ures increases il is found
that the radial mo don of many of these stars
varies in a regular period thus showing that invisible planets
are moving round them a new feature of the universe
is thus brought to our knowledge which if we had
no other instrument than the telescope would remain forever hidden
the difference between the measures made with the telescope and
the spectroscope consists in this the telescope can show the
change in the position of a star only when it
is great enoukh to he visible at the enormous distance
of the star commonly this change must be measured by
hundreds of millions of miles nay thou sands of millions
else it would never be seen in the telescope but
e spectroscope shows at any moment how fast the star
is moving lo or from us though it gives us
no information all to its actual distance it is not
therefore necessary that the star should have moved through a
definite space in order to have its modon detected by
the change in its spectrum having given the speed of
the revolution and the period it becomes possible to determine
the size of the orbit pairs of stars discovered with
the spectro scope are called speclroseopic bvtory systems the comparisons
in such systems are not how ever necessarily dark stars
the revolubons of a pair of stars both of which
are bright may be determined with the spectroscooe as if
one of the bodies were dark in this case the
lines of the spectrum are sometimes double and sometimes single
they seem double when one star is moving from us
and the other toward us and single when the stars
are moving later ally to the line of sight from
us to them thus bright double stars are shown by
the use of the spectroscope which no telescope however powerful
can distinguish to be more than a single star that
this doubling of the lines is a true indicadon of
a double star system is shown by the fact that
at least one spectroscopic pair can also be seen as
a double in the telescope the orbits derived from the
visual measures and from a study of the light respectively
are in remarkably close agreement the most successful discoveries in
this line have been made in recent times by or
imdet the direction of professor campbell in the lick observatory
where it may almost be said that a new branch
of astronomy has been cre ated the discoveries of these
objects are now going on so rapidly that it is
impassible to set any limit to their number the general
rule is found to be that the orbits described do
not differ greatly in maitude from those de scribed by
our planets in moving round the sun that is to
say there are few or no orbits yet known which
are as large as that of neptune there is however
no limit to the minuteness of the orbits some stars
revolving almost in contact with each other besides double stars
there are triple and quadruple stars of such variety that
it is im possible to give any general description of
them the most remarkable quadruple system is found in the
great nebula of orion where theta orionis which looks to
the naked eye like a single star is shown by
the telescope to con sist of four stars forming a
trazium this is therefore known as the trapezium or orion
altogether these systems show the infinite vari ety of the
great bodies which make up the universe the pairs of
stars which form a binary system may be of every
degree of bright ness and of very different masses their
times of revolution range from two or three days to
unknown thousands of years in a few cases the masses
have actually been determined it is a curious fact that
they do not vary so much as does the brightness
of the stars when a bright and a faint star
form a binary system the mass of the faint star
is generalli out of proportion to the amount of light
it emits we have already remarked that many stars are
thousands of times as bright as the sun but it
is a curious fact that none have been found to
have even hundreds of times the mass of the variable
stars to ordinary observations even to observations extending through genera
tions the light of the stars seem to be as
per manent as the order of nature itself but although
his is true of the great majority of stars which
stud the heavens it is now found that there are
exceptions to the rule so nu merous have these exceptions
become that the studv of variable stars has developed into
one of the important branches of astronomy the d google
503 sta first star which was found to be variable
in its light is known as mira ceti or the
wonder of the constellation celus the whale this con stellation
extends from two hours to three hours of right ascension
and its central regions are situated a little south of
the equator it is on the meridian at some hour
in the evenings o the winter months the sur mira
is quite mvisible to the naked eye the greater part
of the time but is found to blaze up at
regular but slightly varying intervals of about 11 months some
times attwnin to the second magnitude after remaining visible to
the naked eye for a few days it gradually fades
away into invisibility but may always be seen in a
telescope lis greatest briehtness varies markedly some times it britens
up only to the fifth magni tude and is then
not at all conspicuous there are two other remarkable variable
stars one is algol in the constellation per seus which
may be seen in some part of the northern sky
at some hour on almost any night of the year
except in april and may com monly this star is
between the second and third magnitude and is usually classified
as of the second magnitude at regular intervals of a
little less than three daj it fades away to the
fourth magnitude and then after a few hours gradually mcreases
again to its regular bright ness it is now known
that this diminution of light is a partial eclipse of
the star the brighter star is about 51 times as
bright as our own sun while the socalled dark companion
is about three and onethird limes as bright thus the
companion is verj far from being a dark body but
its interposition so greatly re duces the light which we
receive from the brighter star that the effect of an
eclipse is produced in another class of variable stars these
two bodies are each of noticeable brightness so that the
liht which we receive from them varies twice in each
revolution once when the brighter star partially hides the fainter
one and once when it is itself partly hidden strictly
speak ing the system of algol should be now included
in this class since by the emnloyinent of the delicate
selenium photometer the light of its companion can be definitely
measured the most remarkable of this class is beta lyric
quite near the bright star vega it may be seen
in some part of the northern sky dur ing the
spring summer and autumn although the changes in its light
are not striking one who looks at it carefully night
after night will these three stars are only examples of
a number of such objects now known to exceed 1000
scattered over the whole sky as obser vations become more
and more accurate it is found that quite a number
of the stars visible to the naked eye arc subject
to slirht fluctua tions of light mostly in a more
or less regular period hut sometimes in a quite irregular
way spectroscopic observations render it somewhat probable that in most
cases the regular changes are produced by bright or dark
uidies rcolv ing round the star in very eccentric orbits
sometimes they partially eclipse the star as we have already
mentioned hut in many other cases it seems likely that
they make the star blaie up by the disturbance they
make when they approach close to it in their orbits
the goieral rule is that a variable star goes through
its series of changes in a regular period at a
certain day and hour it reaches its least brightness which
is called a minitnum then it begins to increase in
light in the course of a certain number of hours
or days it increases to its greatest brightness then it
be gins to decrease and once more fades away to
its minimum the length of time between two minima is
a period commonly the successive periods of a variable star
are near equal to each other so that the stage
of brightness at any future time can be predicted with
confi dence the periods range very widely from a few
hours to about 600 days it is very re markable
that no period yet known exceeds two years there are
many periods less than a month but there are only
eight between so and 100 days the number then increases
up to 350 days the greatest number of periods is
just about one of our years a coincidence which of
course is a pure accident above this their frequency rapidly
falls off this limitation of the period strengthens the view
that the vari ability of a great number of stars
is produced by the disturbing action of an immense body
revolving round the star in a very eccentric new stara
in past generations when the whole universe was suddosed to
be only a few thousand years old it was quite
natural to exject that new stars would from time to
time be created to shine among their fellows but this
view has now to be modified it is true thai
from time to time a star is seen to blaie
out where none was known before but the theory of
a new creation is refuted by the fact that such
stars invariably fade out in the course of a few
weeks or months on some very rare occasions they have
continued visible to die naked eye for a year or
more and they can commonly be seen by the telescope
for several years the first remarkable case of this sort
of which we have a scientific record occurred in 1752
on 11 november of that year tycho brahe the celebrated
astronomer of uraniburg observed a star ot the first magnitude
in the constellation cassiopeia before the end of the month
it was so bright as to be visible in full
daylight then it began to fade away and finally disappeared
from view in may following this was before the invention
of the telescope so that lycho was unable to trace
the star any longer thirtytwo years later kepler observed a
similar star in the constellation ophiuchus this star continued visible
to the naked eye for more than a year but
it never became so bright as the star of tycho
as the heavens were more carefully watched and photographs of
the stars were taken these new stars were found to
be more frequent than was formerly supposed during the 19th
century 11 were observed to blaze out more than hlf
of which were dur ing the last a years of
the century but the fjrealest number of them scarcely reached
the imil of visibility to the naked eye being dis
covered principally by photography on 20 feb 1901 the most
wonderful of these objects which had been seen for 300
years blazed out in the constellation perseus in two or
three days it was the third brightest star in the
heavens then following ttie example of its predecessor it gradually
faded away thou it dgt google photograph of the great

cnthdrijuck liibpul titfem i still remains visible in the telescope
it is not yet certain whether this object was impressed
on any photographs until within a few days of its
first appearance similarly on 8 june 1919 a brilliant new
star appeared in aquila almost on the border between aquila
ana serpens when brightest this was almost as bright as
vega the brightest star of the northern heavens and it
was of a very blue color it rapidly faded away
until now it is onl a telescopic object by what
convulsion of nature these objeas burst forth it is quite
beyond the power of our present science to decide it
is certain that the amount of light and heat emitted
by these stars was suddenly increased hundreds or even thousands
of times one of the most plausible explanations is that
of a collision it is supposed that the star itself
may have col hded with another perhaps a planet in
its neighborhood or rushed to its own destruc tion in
some nebulous mass but this is only very curious has
been the fate of these objects after they have faded
away those recently observed have been found to change into
nebulx a mass of glowing gas emitting the bright spectral
rays of hydrogen and other ses photographs and spectroscopic observa
tions ve evidence of some explosive action throwing out corpuscles
with immense velocity in every direction but throw no light
on the ongin of the explosion star clnsters one of
the remarkable fea tures of the heavens revealed by the
telescope consists in star clusters great numbers of these bodies
crowded into a space which meas ured by the expanse
of the heavens must be comparatively limited it is not
at all uncom mon to find hundreds of stars in
a single bunch so closely packed together that to the
naked eye or in a small telescope nothing is seen
but a minute patch of light one of the most
re markable of these contains 60000 stars situated in the
constellation hercules another in the constellation centaurus was described by
sir john herschcl as one of the most remarkable objects
in the heavens there exists every variety of such dusters
from these closely packed ones to the agglomerations of the
milky way which any careful observer of the heavens can
see on any dear evening during the late summer and
autumn close together as the component stars of these clusters
appear to be ttere is no doubt that they are
really sepa rate from each other by distances vaster than
those which separate the planets of our solar system otherwise
the most powerful telescope would not distinguish them as separate
stars but present them to our view as if confused
lo gether in one mass of light by several different
methods the distances from us of the globular clusters have
very recently been found by shapley of the mount wilson
solar observatory it is shown that while the cluster in
centaurus is the nearest the more distant are not infinitely
remote from our milky way cluster but are outside of
it and apparently connected with it they are in short
now known to be small universes of stars the distances
through them being meas ured in hundreds of light years
instead of in tens of thousands as in the case
in our milky way cluster it is a remarkable fact
that many of these clusters contain a great number of
variable stars this fact taken in connection with the probable
cause of variability already men tioned makes plausible the idea
that close binaty systems are very numerous in the dusters
if at any one moment all the stars of the
cluster were at rest they would in course of time
be drawn together by mutual gravitation each star must therefore
be in motiim relative to the others describing some kind
of an orbit around their centre of gravity the laws
gf revolution in cases like this must be vet complicated
but as they require thousands of years to go through
their changes and accurate observations have been made for hardly
more than a century astronomers are not yet able to
investigate them fully constitution of ampe stara there is no
reasonable doubt that the general constitution of the stars is
the same as that of our sun and that they
consist of masses of intensely hot vapors of the substance
composing them com pressed together by the mutual gravitation of
their parts as we have already said the stars are
composed in the main of the subfitances found to exist
in the sun but probably in a great variety of
forms as regards densi and temperature the spectra of the
stars conust ing as most of them do of a
bright continuous spectrum crossed by dark lines show that we
see the luminous surface through an atmos ehere cooler than
itself though really intensely ot the stars differ enormously in
their actual luminosity that is in the actual amount of
light emitted by each if they were all equally lumi
nous we could form an idea of their relative distance
by their brightness the farther a star was away the
fainter it would ine but as a matter of fact
some of the brightest stars in the heavens are so
distant that their parallax proves to be immeasurably small this
is not the case with sirius the brightest of all
which has a parallax of 0 38 showing it to
be situ ated at a distance from which light would
travel in about nine years but the next bright est
camius not visible farther north than our southern states is
so distant that no parallax can be shown hy the
most refined measures the conchision is that it must be
10000 times as luminous as our sun possibly 100000 times
this is the case with several stars in or near
the constellation orion at the other extreme we find that
among the nearer stars are several not visible to the
naked eye it is true that the nearest of all
alpha centauri is nearly of the first magnitude but the
next in order 61 csigni is only of the sixth
mnitude two ouiers are quite invisible to the naked eye
this shows that diere are stars much less lumi than
the sun and that the greatest stars probably millions of
times tttore luminous than the smallest ones bibliography ball sir

low ered vitality accompanied by emaciation en feeblement which if
prolonged results in death through lack of food starve is
derived from old english iteorfan to die the phenomena of
starvation presents subjects of great interest from their bearing upon
phenomena induced through the inability to take nourishment oc casioned
by some diseases according to chos sat the symptoms which
intervene m starva tion are at first marked by a
veiy rapid di minution in the weight of the body
this de crease however becoming more gradual as death approaches
a striking unifiormity is found between the period at which
death re sults from starvation and the loss of weight
experienced thus chossat found that in dif ferent warmblooded animals
death resulted when the body had lost about 40 per
cent or twofifths of its original and normal eighi great
variations undoubtedly existed m the extremes of chossats cases the
circumstances which seem most powerfully to have affected these results
being the amount of fat con lained in the body
prior to the beginning of 1 period the animals which
had most fat stored up lost weight quickest and at
the same time lived longest chossat ound that in animals
undergoing starvation the symp toms observed during the first half
or two thirds of the period are those of cahnness
and quietness the temperature then becoming ele vated restlessness and
agitation prevails and when life is terminated by the rapid
fall of the temperature stupor supervenes the ex tremities become
cold and weak and are finally unable to support tbc
weight of the body while the pupils of the eyes
become dilated and occasionally at death convulsive twitchings may be
present the excreta are small in quantity after those which
are voided as the result of the food last partaken
of and con sist chiefly of greenish matters probably de
rived from the yiiary secretions at death the feeces became
watery and contain saline matters the fatty matters are almost
entirely re moved by starvation and the blood loses three
fourths of its original amount it is probable that the
total nutritive powers of the body during starvation go to
nourish the nervous tissues the loss of which is very
small while the true mode of death from starvation ap
eears to be death from want of heat the body
eing preserved alive notwithstanding the want of fresh nutritive material
by the combustion or absorption of the fatly matters it
contains chossat also found that proportionally to che more active
nutrition and waste in young animals such died sooner from
starvation than older forms and he also determined the equally
important fact that if young animals especially are supplied with
an insufficient amount of food ihey succumb as if they
were actually starved the process of starvation being of necessity
more gradual in the latter instance the mere variations in
the temperature ob served by chossat formed more prominent points
of note in his observations than the actual decrease of
heat it fluctuated or varied daily in some cases some
5 and 6 f instead of 1 and 2 f
as observed in the normal and healthv state of the
body in the human sub ject the symptoms of starvation
have been closely studied by physiologists with the effect of
determining a stated order in their ap pearance and effects
the preliminary hun ger appears to be accompanied in the
first instance by severe pain in the stomach and epigastric
region generally the thirst be comes intense and although undoubtedly
in man the want of water induces death at a
much earlier period than where drink is at tainable by
kgtwer forms for example birds the want of water may
in reality make com paratively little difference in the invasion
of the fatal period sleeplessness appears to be early manifested
the severe pain at first felt in the stomach gradually
ceasing a charac teristic feeling of sinking and weakness is
de scribed as occurring in the epigastric region the thirst
still continuing to an agonizing de gree the face assumes
meanwhile an anx ious pale expression the eyes are wild
and staring and the whole countenance and body participate in
rapid general emaciation the body latterly exhales a fetid lodor
the breath and lung secretions become strongsmelling and the skin
is said to become covered with google starved rock stats
these results doubtless arising from the decomposition and organic decay
of the tissues the gait totters the mind becomes impaired
delirium or convul sions may ensue and death occurs with
or with out the accompaniment of diarrhaa post mortem reveals
a state of anxmia in alt parts of the body
but the brain which appears to the last to receive
a due supply of blood the fat is entirely wanting
and the various organs and tissues have greatly lost in
bulk the coats of the small intesline are found exceedingly
thin the kailbladder generally contains mud bite and tie body
goes more rapidly to decay than after death from ordinary
causes starvation suggests inquiries respecting ab stinence in diet and
from various or particular kinds of food a sudden and
unfavorable change in a given dietary niay induce in virtue
of the new food containing a low percentage of certain
nutritive matters symptoms analogous to those of starvation want of
nutriment produces an incapacity for the digestion of whatevef amount
is supplied a result probably due to nervous causes and
primarily perhaps to the want of stimulation of the appetite
through insufficient secretion of gastric juice where the temperature of
the body is main tained in tolerable efficiency life may
be pro longed for great periods without food a state
of syncope prevailing as in several noted cases of socalled
apparent death it was found by chossat that in the
case of animals whose death seemed imminent from starvation restoration
took place primarily by the applica tion of artificial heat
they thus manifested activity mid were able afterward to partake
of food from 8 to 10 days is regarded as
the usual period during which human life can be supported
without food or drink if water be given this period
may be greatly exceeded and where a moist condition of
the atmos phere exists life may for the same reason
be prolonged a case is recorded in which some workmen
were dug out alive after 14 days confinement in a
cold damp vault and another is mentioned in which a
miner was extricated alive after beii shut up in a
mine for 23 days during the first 10 of which
he subsisted on a little dirty water he died however
three days after bis release life has been prolonged for
60 days in a person suffering from religious mania who
abstained from food supporting his existence by sucking an orange
in some remarkable cases of nervous hysteria and other diseased
conditions no food may be taken and yet the body
be perfectly sus tained the system is disposed or becomes
inured to the abstinence just as under other conditions it

stassfurtite a massive variety of the mineral boracile qv occurring
chiefly at stassfurt germany where a few hundred tons are
annually produced state political scientists of the present day distinguish
sharply between the idea con noted by the term state
and that indicated by the word government by state is
meant the bodypolitic abstractly considered the en tity that possesses
and exercises the sovereign political will by government is meant
the mechanism of political rule the ensemble of the agencies
through which the tasks of the state are performed the
present article will be devoted to a discussion of the
nature of the state a treatment of governuent will be
found under that title as distinguished from a society by
which is meant simply an aggregate of human beings living
together and united by mutual economic and social interests a
state is a body of in dividuals that has assumed
an organized form that has a definite membership and has
created for itself specific organs or expressing and enforcing its
corporate will thus in order that there may be a
state three elements must be present 1 an aggregate of
human beings individually termed citizens or subjects form ing a
single group and as such termed a people 2 a
pohtical apparatus termed a government and administered by a corps
of officials collectively termed a magistracy and 3 a body
of rules or maxims written or unwritten which are generally
recognized to be such as may rightfully be enforced by
those entrusted with the exercise of the powers of the
state whether or not to these three es sential elements
there should be added a fourth namely a definite area
of land there is a difference of opinion the eminent
ger man publicist bluntschli wbo may be taken d google
soe sta as a representative of one view defines a
state as the politically organized national per son of a
definite country on ihc olher hand holland declares that a
state is a numer ous assemblage of human beings generally
oc cupying a certain lerritory among whom the will of
the majority or of an ascertainable class of persons is
by the strength of such a majority or class made
to prevail against any number who oppose it the definition
of blunlschli is undoubtedly applicable to all mod em civilized
states but certainly is not descrip tive of verj many
bodiespolitic of ihe past indeed political sovereignty by which is
meant the supreme power of the state was for many
years according to the ideas of the peoples of western
europe not territorial at all but based upon a personal
allegiance of the subjects to their rulers a people a
government and a body of laws are what may be
termed the essential material elements of which a state is
composed in ad dition to these there is one characteristic
that it must possess in order properly to deserve its
title and to be distinguished from the others and lower
tpes of political lite this unique and distinguishing characteristic is
sovereignty by sovereignty is meant the highest or supreme power
it thus means chat its possessor is it self the
ultimate source of all the laws that are enforced over
the territory which it claims as its own and over
citizens or other persons subject to its authority it means
in short formal legal omnipotence the word formal is used
for of course the power of control that any state
may actually exercise is limited by the intolerance of its
subjects of oppression but formally a state because legally subject
to the control of no other lawmaking igtower has the
power to issue such legally finding commands as it sees
fit directly or indirectly it is the source of all
the rules that regulate not only the conduct of its
subjects and others for the time being subject to its
authority but those that determine the form of its own
government and the respective powers of its several organs and
officials the exercise of all political powers either by individuals
or associations of individuals are therefore vali dated only by
its sanction the state is thus matters that it will
regulate and the manner in which it will regulate them
thus as the austrian publicist jellinek has put it obli
gation through its own will is the legal char acteristic
of the state it is the state it is o
be observed that is the possessor of sovereignty its subject
as continental writers express it not the gov ernment to
the government is entrusted only the execution of the sovereign
will of the state the powers of each governmental organ
and of each public official are obtained from the stale
and are limited and defined by its laws thus at
any given time a citizen though potentially subject in every
matter of life liberty and property to the will of
his state possesses a sphere of freedom defined by exist
ing laws upon which hose exercising political authority may not
trespass to quote the words of professor burgess the individual
is defended in this sphere against the government by ihe
power the state that makes and main tains and can
destroy the government and by ihal same power through the
government against encroachments from any other quarter against that power
itself however he has no sovereignty is an attribute of
a political body that has to be demonstrated as a
matter of fact and not as a matter of law
in other words there is no proper distinction between de
facto and de jure slates these terms being applicable only
to governments see govern ment if a given community of
human beings yielding a general obedience to an es tablished
government asserts and fairly demon strates that it is able
to maintain a freedom from the control of any other
political power it becomes by that very fact a slate
and is en titled to recognition by other states as
such it is however the actual fact of independence from
foreign control and maintenance of domestic order that demonstrates the
existence of the sovereignity of the state in question and
not its recognition as a state by the other powers
thus for example the american colonies ceased to be dependencies
and became slates not by reason of their recognition as
such by england and european nations but because of their
actual ability to maintain that freedom from great britams control
which they formally asserted in 1776 the sovereignty of a
state thus bears a double aspect considered internally hat is
from the viewpoint of municipal law it appears as legal
omnipotence looked at from the viewpoint of its relations to
other states it appears simply as independ ence in the
one case it means the affirmative legal power of enforcing
its will upon all those subject to its authority in
the other case it signifies simply freedom from foreign control
from the domestic standpoint it signifies supremacy from the international
standpoint it means eqnality the stale though itself the source
of all law can only operate through law that is
to say an expression of its sovereign will can validly
proceed only from those legislative mouthpieces that by already existing
law have been granted the right to voice its commands
and these commands may be legally enforced only accordingto laws
already established be cause of its legal omnipotence the state
may at any time alter these rules according to ihe
methods provided for the amendment or repeal of laws but
as they exist at any time the laws control any
action not sanctioned by their provisions however much approved by
those in political authority cannot strictly speaking be termed an
action of the state itself the creator of all law
the stale is not itself a product of law constitutions
create governments not slates they are the crea tions of
states already existent the cre ative force in the birth
of states is that feel ingof unity interests and desires
that leads a society of human beings to assume a
corporate form and create the pofitical organs necfcssary for the
attainment of all those interests that are connected with or
arise out of their existence as a national unit this
being so it follows that sovereignty cannot arise out of
any formali legal or conventional act in other words a
state cannot be created by formal agreement google 907 between
individuals as postulated by the social compact theory nor brought
into being by a compact between sovereign states by a
sur render of private rights individuals cannot create a public
right by a treaty agreement there cannot be created a
political power with a legal authority superior to that of
the parties establishing it from this last fact it ir
resistibly follows that any socalled composite or federal state that
has for its basis a treaty or compact between states
is not in truth a state at all but a
mere leaeue of states and this notwithstanding the fact that
very extensive powers may have been granted to the central
governing power envisaged as a legal person the sovereignty of
a state represents the supremacy of its will as thus
representing a sttoreme will sovcreigntv is necessarilv an in divisible
unity a divided or double sovereignty is an impossibility a
given bodypolitic there fore either possesses sovereignty and js for
that reason a stale or it has not sovereignty and
as a result is not a state but simply an
administrative division of the stale that pos sesses sovereignly over
it in all strictness then it is a misuse of
words to speak of a federal state if by that
term is meant a state formed by a federation of
states for if in such a federation sovereignty is held
to rest in the central body that body is a
state and its constituent commonwealth members are ipso facto reduced
to a nonsovereign condition and therefore lo the status of
administrative dis tricts if however the federating units each retain
their sovereignty ibey remain states and no central sovereignty or
state can be helfl to be created id the one
case there exists but one state with a government composed
of one set of central or federal organs and as
many sets of local governmental organs as there are mem
bers of the union in the other case there exist
as many stales as there are confederated units an equal
number of state governments and a central government that acts
as the com mon agent of the several states but
no central the line of distinction between a single na
tional state composed of nonsovereign bodies politic enjoying extended powers
of selfgovern ment and a confederation of states with a
central government exercising many of the most important sovereign powers
is not always easy to draw the distinguishing criterion is
not the amount of powers actually vested in the central
government as compared with those retained by the individual commonwealths
nor whether the operation of federal law is upon the
iniuvidual states themselves or directly upon their citizens nor necessarily
upon the manner in which the articles of union may
be amended the one absolute test is as to the
power or lack of power of the members of the
union themselves to determine in the last resort not only
the extent of the obligations imiwsed upon them by the
articles of union hut their constitutional right to withdraw from
the union when they see fit bearing in mind the
distinction between the possession of the sovereignty itself and the
mere exercise of certain of its powers it is seen
that a slate may without in any wise impairing its
sovereignty delegate the execution o its commands not only to
governmental agencies of to those of other states for so
long as such other states or their gov ernments act
bui as the agents of the first state it is
die sovereign will of that state that is ex ecuted
and furthermore whatever may be its actual power the state
in question has the legal right itself to assume again
the actual ex ercise of the powers it has granted
such a withdrawal of delegated powers may be in violation
of existing treaties and therefore constitute a just ground for
complaint but it is not an illegal act for treaties
do not create law in the strict positive sense instances
of the delegation by states to other states of the
exercise of important powers is seen in the many socalled
protectorates that exist at the present day confederacies real and
personal unions and colonies are not similar examples for in
them the exercise of powers is granted to government oins
created by the sovereign parties themselves theoretically there is no
limit to the extent to which a state may go
in the delegation to other states of the exercise of
its power if however in any one respect it is
absolutely de prived of a power so that it cannot
legally at its own discretion resume the exercise of it
its leal omnipotence is destroyed and together with it its
sovereignty and right to the title because the denial of
the name state to non sovereign powers makes it necessary
to refuse that title lo the many bodiespoutic that gen
erally have been and are so designated as for example
the members of a federation such as the united states
of america many writers have endeavored to discover some distinctive
attribute other than sovereignly that will serve sharply to distinguish
states from provinces departments and other simple administrative districts the
better opinion would seem to be however that these efforts
have failed and must continue to fail with the test
of sovereignty discarded the dividing line between states and other
political bodies becomes an indeterminate one and therefore an exact
definition of a state an impossibiuty logical exactness therefore even
at the expense of wounding political sentiments requires an ad

growth of i the state an organised political entity possessing
and exercising sovereign powers has always since its establishment controlled
more or less completely the activities of its members social
political economic and moral the extent of such control depending
upon a number of fad such as character of government
state of i classes of society and political and dgt
google state control b09 social ideals states may be divided
into two classes accordine to whether government is completely centralized
or not in completely centralized governments such as great britain
france and italy the right of control is en trusted
to the national authorities while the local subdivisions such as
counties and munici pzlities act as their agents in the
federalized lorm of government such as the united slates and
germany the sovereign powers are par celed ont between the
national and local organizations each government being independ ent of
the other within its own especial field with respect to
growth slate control has ex hibited two marked tendencies first
that of the extension of the field of control entrusted
to national atithorities at the expense of the local subdivisions
and second extension of control exercised by the government at
the expense of the individual liberty of its citizens and
mem bers ii in general there are four distinct theories
upon which the control of the state over indi viduals
and groups of individuals is based viz the divine right
of kings slaaugemachi or force the social contract and sodal
welfare the first of these fundamental theories is aptly illustrated
by the reign of louis xiv of france and his
slogan retat cesi moi durine the past eneration the theory
was expounded and practised by the former emperor of germany
kaiser wilnelm ilwith what results the world knows too well
the second theoretical basis slaatsgttnacht or the doctrine of force
is in practice although not in theory closely associ ated
with the first for the purpose of giving a religious
sanction to the dominating influence of the state over its
citizens the third theory that of the social contract first
formulated by jean jacques rousseau in bis brilliant biit now
generauy discredited social contract con stituted a distinct advance in
political thinking and was naturally accompanied by marked im provement
in national administration and in social wellbeiag the fourth theory
that of social welfare was first enunciated by aristotle in
his politics and revived by the publicists and statesmen of
england and continental europe during the course of the 17th
18th and 19th centuries as an evolutiotiary institution the state
is held to be the natural development of the family
and like it exists not for its own ends but
for the benefit of its individual mem bers according to
this theory the state should exercise control over its menrfiers
whenever and wherever such control results in the general welfare
to determine the scope and extent within which state control
may he wisely ex ercised for the good of its
citizens representa tive vemments have become a practical iii during
the middle ages and even well into the period generally
denominated modern times all the more important european nations were
either absolute or limited monarchies and their governments were dominated
by a group of courtiers who professedly believed in the
divine right of the kings under whom they served as
the rank and file of the citizens sew in political
wisdom they began to discuss e functions of government and
the proper limitations of public control over private rights the
first great movement along these lines ban in england in
the early part of the i7th century and culminated in
the overthrow of the stuarts and the establishment of the
puri tan commonwealth in 1649 unfortunately for the progress of
civil liberty the commonwealth proved unequal to the task imposed
upon it and it was not until the revolution of
1688 that the foundations of parliamentary government and its concomitant
a decent regard for the riglits of individual men were
securely laid from this date onward in england and the
elnglishspeaking countries the evolutionary theory of gjovemment gradually grew to
be the predominating one and with its growth the policy
of economic liberalism became firmly established as a result of
the forces set loose by the american and french revolutions
despite the brief militarism of napoleon and of the re
actionary movement led by metternich and suf ported by the
holy alliance the century begin ning with the year 1776
may be characterized as the golden age of political and
civil liberty in every domain of life during this period
merantilism as a national policy was over thrown the old
time restrictions on trade and industry were largely abrogated and
men were more nearly free to seek their own for
tunes and to live their own lives without in terference
by the government than ever before in the history of
the civilized world iv the establishment of civil and economic
liberty even within the limitations set by the more progressive
governments notably those of the united states great britain and
france brotit results not wholly favorable to the welfare of
certain classes of individuals while the world grew rich with
unprece dented rapidity the wealth tended to accumu late in
the hands of a somewhat limited few the rank and
file although living in compara tive affluence compared with their
former status still remained poor in the defense of the
new system a great literature was created among which adam
smiths wealth of nations john stuart mills political economy her
bert spencers social statics and the man versns the state
and bastiats harmonies economiques should be especially mentioned notwithstanding the
intellectual triumphs achieved by each of these able defenders of
the new order abundantly supported by hosts of lesser lignis
the accumulative unfortunate effects of excessive economic freedom became too
pronounced to be longer ignored by the various states and
therefore beginning about 1830 the tide began to turn in
favor of larger slate control to relieve the situation without
at the same time changing the established order became the
chief object of the political leaders in england france germany
and the united states palhative measures such as the eng
lish poor iaw of 1834 centraliring and stand ardizing the
administrations of charity abol ishing outofdoor relief for the ablebodied
reinstituting the workhouse test regulating the length of hours and
the conditions of em ployment for child labor were concomitantly
tried such measures however were largely ineffectual because tfaev failed
to strike at the root of the trouble ana naturally
enough atten tion was more and more directed toward a
study of the causes which were producing the kirs ew
yoi th lork ll h and idcoma ot tbe umted
stato d google 510 state control unfortunate and unsatisfactory results
as the investigation progressed the students of the sodal order
almost immediately separated into two classes first those who deemed
it wisest to destroy the existing system and inaugurate an
entirely new one second those who pro posed to preserve
the fundamentals while elimi nating certain nonessential features which had
been found to be injurious to the common welfare the
first group of reformers almost imme diately divided inio two
branches the owenites and the marxians the owcniles followers of
robert owen established a large number of independent communistic societies
the most of which soon lusappeared and the owenites with
hem although their ideals arc still of large influence tne
marxians on the other hand although since 1848 continuously exercising
large influence on political and economic theory have never until
the present war except in a very smalt way had
an opportunity to give their solution a practical trial with
the downfall of the russian revolution and the subsequent creation
of the bolshevik government they have established a laboratory for
the practical test of their ideals if this experiment in
industrial and social reorganization should prove able to produce goods
as abundantly and at the same time distribute them more
fairly than the capitalistic system the latter will lor the
first time in history have encountered a real com petitor
the adherents of the present system will in the latter
event be under a stronger pressure than ever before to
institute a sufficient amount of governmental control to insure that
the products jointly produced shall be fairly distributed among the
factors of producdon the second group of reformers while at
tempting to maintain the competitive capitalistic system for the sake
of its great efficiency in production have at the same
time desired to introduce a sufficient amount of state oomrol
to secure what they considered a bih degree of fairness
in distribution their efforts have been centred upon certain critical
problems of which the following are the more important inadequate
wages 2 protecting consumers by a preventing the establishment of
industrial monopolies b by maintaining free competition among business enterprises
and c mamtaining stand ards in the character of the
goods which are produced and sold 3 creating systems of
taxation which while providing abundant revenue for the uses of
the government in undertaking and main taining state control will
at the same time act as an adjusting force in
the distribution of wealth 1 a it was early pointed
out that while the laborer was legally free to work
for whom he pleased and could refuse employment where conditions
or wages were unfavorable to iiiin the employer could generally
wait until the terms he offered were acceptable while the
laborer generally could not that while the employing classes were
living on their capital the eniloyees were starving that consequently
manufactuiina the state ought to interfere on behalf of the
laborer prescribing by law the conditions under which the work
might be carried on and in certain cases at least
the wages at which the laborers might work it was
further noticed that the economic indepmdence of the laborer was
largely conditioned by the character of the industrial organization and
that wherever ma diinery was largely employed the relative ad
vantage of the employer was increased on this account reflation
in behalf of the laborer hegan earlier in the machine
trades and in those countries where machine production was most
widely used england being the first to introduce factory production
on a large scale naturally encountered the labor problem hist
and it is there that the foundations of the pres
ent system of state control in the interests of labor
were laidt in the united states the labor problem attracted
little attention until after the civil war in 1869 massachusetts
created the first labor bureau in the world and following
her example a large number of the states in the
american commonwealth have established similar departments manned by a conderable
force of inspectors and adminis tering laws which are intended
to protect the laboring classes from work under conditions unfavorable
to either health or morals in the case of certain
classes of labor the maxi mum number of hours which
the laborer may work has been prescribed by law as
a result of state control in this sphere of action
it has come to pass that the conditions under which
the american laborer works are fairly conduc ive to good
health to a reasonable standard of morals and to a
fairly long life the general establishment of the factoiy system
together with its necessary concomi tants mining and railway transportation
intro duced a new element into the labor problem mainly
that of danger to life and limb until comparatively recent
years i was generally assumed by those responsible for legislation
that the wageearning classes were fully capa ble of taking
care or themselves that placing the risk of the industrj
upon the employers would be sure to result in carelessness
on the part of the operatives and high cost of
produc tion for the goods sold it was therefore the
established rule of law in all countries that the employer
would be held responsible only for damages to life and
limb due to his own negli gence while the employees
must suffer those resulting from their own lack of care
to secure redress for injuries due to the careless ness
of the employer the employee was obliged to bring a
suit at law stating the cause for his complaint and
offering evidence to show that the employer was legally responsible
for the acci dent that caused the damage in the
litition that arose over such cases the judges in the
atsence of specific statutes to the ontrary de veloped a
series of commonlaw doctrines which to a large extent modified
the original theory of the law these doctrines are that
of con law the employer could be held liable only
when the accident was due to his own fault or
neg lect but not when the negligence of the em
t 3 a 4 wm i i dec 1913 dy
google state control ployee coniribuied to ihe accident or when
the accident was due to a natural risk of the
employment nor when the accident was due to the act
of a fellowservant under these conditions the employer was legally
respon sible for damage resulting from certain classes of accidents
but even when legally responsible it was not easy for
the injured employee to prove his case and collect compensation
for the damages moreover suits against the em ployer were
not conducive to pleaaam relation ships and gradually it became
the custom or the employer to take out liability insurance
under which the insurance cmnpanies undertook to defend all suits
as well as to pay all dam ages incurred thus
while the liability to pay damages on account of accidents
was a real factor in the cost of production viewed
from the employers standpoint comparatively little of this expense filtered
into the pockets of the employees as compensation for their
injuries with the growing appreciation of the unfairness of the
common law the social reformers of the revolutionary type proposed
and finally secured remedial legislation tiy the passage of the
socalled workmens compensation acts by virtue of which the common
law rules were largely and in some cases fully abrogated
and in their place a system of direct compensation for
various accidents substituted in this movement germany look the lead
establishing the first system of accident compensation on a large
scale in 18amp since that date a8 other countries incltding
the united states have adopted the same national system and
in the united states 35 of her commonwealths and territories
had on or before the first of janu ary 1917
enacted either compulsory or elective compensation acts in general the
administra tion of the compensation acts is entrusted to a
commission that established in wisconsin in 1911 being generally regarded
as an efficient type 1 b state control of wages
has for rea sons that are readily appreciated made much
less progress than public rckulalion of the con ditions under
which the laborer works the movement of establishing public control
of wages began in new zealand in 1894 and for
15 years thereafter was confined to the coun tries in
that comer of the globe since 1909 when the first
minimum wc act in any of the older countries was
passed by the enactment of the trade boards act of
october 1909 in great britain the system has been extended
in that country to coal mines by the act of
29 march 1912 and in the united states to various
lines of work in certain oi the com monwealths the
arguments relied upon to defend the system of minimum was
are similar in their nature and in their vahdity to
those advanced in favor of the compensation acts namely the
failure of competitive forces to insure a fair distribution of
wealth for those engaged in certain occupations while no method
has yet been devised by which a reason able wage
may be determined by law it has not proven impracticable
to establish minimum wages in the sweated industries on the
basis of wages for similar work in the nonsweated industries
the object and the natural results 1 wage legislation then
is found to be the restoration of normal competitive con
ditions by state action in those industries where the laissesfaire
system has for reasons that arc sometimes obscure but more
often patent failed to work 2 a from the age
of elizabeth when the english patents of monopoly threatened to
be come a prominent feature of the crowns pre rogative
up to the period of the civil war in the
united states competition between indus trial and commercial enterprises was
su dently active and at the same time sufficiently moderate
to prevent ihe growth and develop ment of industrial monopolies
in a large wa immediately after the conclusion of the
civil war conditions began to change the new con ditions
lending to promote the growth of large combinations and consolidations
in various fields of industriai activity the first of these
conditions was economic the second moral and intellectual with the
development of steam as a motive force the larger factories
were found to be more ebicient as producers of standardized
commodities and a process of elimination thereupon followed the smaller
fac tories giving way to the larger ones at the
same time the proprietors and managers for merly abnormally hostile
and suspicious began to get acquainted with each other at
the dubs and at informal gatherings and as a result
of this acquaintance they discovered that contraiy to their fonner
beliefs cooperation was oiten limes more advantageous than open and
con tinuous warfare as a result of these two con
current forces the consolidation movement be gan first among the
railroads and later among the industries th railroads began consoli
dating even before the civil war while the first of
the great industrial consolidations began with he union of the
interests of the rocke fellers andrews harkness and flagler in
1867 from that date until 1904 when the govern ment
became active in controlling the forma tion and operation of
various kinds of combi nations the consolidation movement was unin
terrupted in its prress when measured either by the number
of enterprises united or by the size of the resulting
organizations the trust movement began to attract public interest in
certain sections of the couniiy as early as 1877 although
it was not until 10 years later that the problem
became a national one as a re sult of the
investigations made by congress in connection with the preparation and
enactment of the interstate commerce act of 1887 pub lic
attention became more intensely focused upon consolidations their nature and
import and after two years of discussion the sherman act
of 18913 was enacted into law during the same period
the state lefdslators were engaged in investigating combinations and in
passing certain acts to protect intrastate business from monopolistic enterprises
so that by the end of the 19tli century 32
of the american states had anti trust acts on their
statute books not withstanding the legislation prohibiting such organizations the
trusts continued to develop and it was not until the
creation of the bureau of corporations 14 feb 1903 and
the simul taneous adoption of a vigorous administrative policy by
the department of justice that the trust movement began to
abate since 1903 a considerable number of combinations have been
dgt google 618 state control dissolved several of the corpite
consolida tions have been disintegrated and at the same time
the formation of new combinations and new consolidations has generally
ceased when america entered the world war suits then in
progress directed against several of the larger consolidations were by
action of the supreme court on motion of the attomeygeneral
postponed for the duration of the war it may be
inferred as a result of the better knowl edge of
cooperative effort engendered during such a way that decisions like
that rendered in the northern securities case of 1904 will
no longer be possible on the other hand combi nations
will be judged from the efficiency standpoint and government control
established in such a way that their efficiency may redound
to the common good 2 b in 1914 an important
change in the laws relating to combinations and competitive methods
of doing business was introduced by the repeal of the
act creating the bureau of corporations and the enactment of
two addi tional statutes for the better regulation of the
activities of business enlerprises the first of the two acts
was that creating the federal trade commission the second the
oayton actt the result of the legislation of 1914 was
to establish a commission of five persons in place of
the bureau of corporations and to impose upon the newlycreated
commission cer tain additional duties of which the most im
portant arc the enforcement of fair methods of competition and
the establishment of certain standards by which fair competition may
be judged during the year ending 30 june 1918 the
commission received 332 complaints charg ing unfair competitive methods or
other viola given to maintaining fair competition among competing business
enterprises and less to the investigation of the combinations of
various kinds if as confidently believed by many students of
industrial conditions the establish ment and maintenance of fair competitive
con ditions by government action is efficacious in preventing many
types of combinations then the problem of industrial monopoly for
the immediate future is partially if not completely 3 while
the state has always either directly or indirectly exercised its
sovereign right of taxation for the purpose of providing revenue
to meet its expenses it was not until recent years
that tax systems were designed with the avowed purpose of
controlling the production and the distribution of wealth taxes for
the purpose of controlling production cither directly or indirectly are
illustrated by those on bever ages narcotics and certain drugs
sometimes the article itself is taxed sometimes the privi lege
of selling as license fees for saioons and orficr articles
whose consumption it is desired to check another example of
ancient lineage is the tax on importation or exportation in
act of 16 sept i itquarlerti june 1914 this case
production is diecked in one country and promoted in the
other the ultimate effect of the tax lieing determined by
the rate of the tax and 1 the elasticity of
the demand the international economic effects of state control through
import duties is aptly illustrated by the historical evolution of
great britain and germany the former nation has followed the
policy of lausegfaire with respect to foreign trade the utter
that of public control through the tariff great britain became
a specialist in manu facture with a consequent large development
of international commerce germany became an allaround producer a farmer
a manufacturer a trader and a financier good in each
without being preeminent in any when the world war came
on englands most vulnerable spot was her dependence on foreign
trade for food as well as for a portion of
her raw materials and germany well knowing this launched her
sub marine campaign as her best line of attack to
parry tms offensive england was obliged to maintain at her
peril her acknowledged mastery of the seas in order that
her merchant marine might bring the requirements which her position
as a specialist daily demanded ger many on the other
hand was able to withdraw from the seas since her
diversified powers of production were sufficiently extensive to pro vide
for her major wants for a considerable period of time
in view of the experience of england and germany some
publicists have argued that taxation through tariffs ought to be
more widely used for the purpose of forc ing a
nation to become more largely selfsuffi cient in the production
of the essentials of a complete national life taxation for
the purpose of controlling the distribution of wealth has long
been under stood by economists and statesmen but for rea
sons that are patent httte used until the recent world
war furnished the necessary stimulus by imposing burdens upon the
participating gov ernments so stupendous that die historic meth ods
of raising revenue were found to be en tirely inadequate
to find additional reve nue without at the same time
imposing burdens of crushing weight upon the poorer classes of
society rates of taxation it was thought must progressively increase
with the sie of the income as a result of
the war then we have a new system of taxation
in actual operation one whose ultimate effect is to change
profoundly the distribution of wealth by relieving certain of the
poorer classes largely if not entirely from the paying of
taxes based upon incomes and imposing far weightier bur dens
than ever before upon those whose in comes exceed the
requirements of rational life v war by emphasiiing the importance
of concerted action strengthens the hands of those who believe
in an efficient and extensive system of state control and
at the same time and or the same reason weakens
the cause of those who favor the policy oe economic
liberalism on this account the period beginning with the civil
war of 1861 and terminating with the fran co prussian
war of 10 years later marks a turning point in
the growth of state control it was generally conceded that
the prussian system was efficient and the results of the
three wars by means of which prussia became the dominant
force in central europe argued so eloquently for strongly centralized
governments d google stafle and corporatioh state department actink under
wide powers that even england and ac united slates began
to study lo aamirc and then to cop the style
of government which they had previous lo this period condemned
in theory and avoided in practicct but even thoueh yielding
somewhat to the adherents of the prussian system the rank
and file of the eng ksh and american people resisted
the proposed innovations and when the world war came in
august 1914 both nations great britain and the united states
were still predominantly exponents of a modified laissesimre system germany
on the other hand partly as a result of certain
habits and traditions and partly be cause of the fact
that she was always either en gaged in or preparing
for war continued to extend the activities of her government
so widely and so deeply that no private interest and
no individual was left untouched by this process of pruastanization
individuals instead of haas left free either partially or wholly
to pursue their own courses as it seemed best for
their own interests were forced to shape their ftclivities in
accordance with the policies de tenained upon by the government
of the day industries uiat were thoit to be essential
for uccesb in war wtie fostered and protected br subsidies
or other favoring legislation economic and social institutions were en
couraged and established or discourd and rhibited accordinp as they
were thchight to elements of national strength or causes of
national weakness the general results of this policy became evident
inunediately the world war was well under way england and
the united states strong in peace were weak in war
france a nation historically opposed to extensive state control had
so far copied the prussian system as to maintain a
formidable standing aiiny while otherwise following the policy of england
and the united states france tfaerefore was able to hold
the german forces in check while england and the united
states the pronounced exponents of economic liberalisni began to prepare
the former because she became a participant at the outset
the latter because it early became evident that she might
be involved at any instant both england and the united
states thus found it necessary in the interests of national
efficiency to abandon their historic methods of managing their domes
tic affairs and substitute therefor the one by which germany
had so completely unified her national resources men and materials
labor and capital and turned the machine thus created upon
those who threatened lo block her path in her quest
for world empire to accomplish the transition from a latsses
faire government to a system of complete state control england
france and the united stales followed similar paths to secure
adequate transportation fadlilies tor the national needs it was early
perceived especially in england that the railway shipping telegraph and
tele phone all these instruments of communication must be operated
as units under the direct con trol of the central
governments and with small delay the required authority was franted
the several administrations communication through railways ships telegraphs and telephone
is however only an instrument of production and production ot
arms of food and of clothing in b18 the necessary
quantities and of the proper kinds were equally essential lo
the successful prosecution of the war factories that had been
producing nonessentials must be made to produce essentials and farms
and mines must join the factories in furnishing raw materials
food minerals and other necessary articles for an efficient life
to secure control over produc tion factories and mines were
commandeered enlaived or closed down as the situation de manded
havinff secured control of production and communication a third step
became natural in all cases and necessary in some that
of coti irol over distribution by means of which ma
terial and labor available for use could be divided among
men and industries in such a way that each unit
of productive power would be most useful to the nation
without regard to any other factors in carrying this policy
of completely unified state cotitrol into operation the united states
adopted a somewhat different plan from diat followed in england
whereas m the latter country authority was largely c tred
in the number of administraiiv dependent alaough in general centralized
under thr immediate control of the president thus where england
had her ministry of munitions the united states had the
food and fuel ad ministrations the emergency fleet eorporalion the
war trade board the war industries board the federal railway
administration the national war labor board the labor policies board
and the united states employment service all act ing as
separate entities except as unified by n control exercised by
the chief by such means the industrial ac of all
classes of citizens in the allied re soon after the
beginning of the war as completely and it is probable
as efficiently controlled as in that great proto type of
state control germany herself now that the war is over
and peace has come again the question as to whether
economic liberalism has been abandoned permanently or only temporarily is
the most important one now before the western world the
ease and fa cility with which the allied nations transformed
themselves into fighting machines the initia tive and resourcefulness displayed
by industrial leaders and working men in conducting to a
successful conclusion a war for which they had not directly
perpared furnishes strong if not conclusive evidence that the economic
sys tem under which they have been living and pitjspering
in ihe past possesses merits of such a character that
it should not be lightly dis carded in favor of
one that has been proven to be provocative of wars

provided for in the constitution of the united states the
people of the united states under their national constitu tion
have assumed the obligation of guarantee ing to each state
the republican form of gov ernment of protecting it against
foreign in vasion and domestic insurrection and of secur ing
to its citizens all the rights and privileges of citizens
of the united states each state on the other hand
is obliged to respect the supremacy of the constitution the
taws and the treaties of the united states and to
per mit its government to act for certain purposes as
the agent of the government of the united stales in
general however the government of the united states operates directly
upon the people of the united states and there is
no occasion to rely upon the state govern ments for
the accomplishment of national pur poses the states are also
obliged to give full faith and credit to one anothers
public acts and records to extend equal privileges to one
anothers citizens to return fugitives from justice and to submit
controversies among themselves it not settled by mutual greement to
the arbitrament of the supreme gturt of the united states
the power of the national government however to enorce some
of these obligiations is defective powen of the state the
powers re served to the states may be said in
a general way to include all the powers of free
and in dependent slates except 1 those which are exjjressly
delegated to the government of the united states or are
reasonably implied in the grant of the expressed powers 2
those which are expressly prohibited to the states and 3
those which though neither expressly delegated to the national government
bv the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states
are reserved to the people of the united states of
the powers expressly delegated to the na tional government some
such as the power to govern the territories of the
united sutes or the district of columbia do not directly
affect the powers of the states some of those however
which do not directly affect the powers of the states
such as the towers to tax to regulate interstate and
foreign com merce and to make treaties may be used
in such a manner as indirectly to affect very strongly
the exercise by the slates of their re served powers
others such as the power to establish a uniform bankniptcy
law may not limit the powers of the states unless
congress expressly so orders some powers su as the power
to coin money are reenforced by express prohibitions upon the
states the other express prohibitions upon he states are of
varying importance probably the nuht important besides those intended to
give the national government exclusive control of for eign relations
and the conduct of war are those incorporated in the
constitution at the ckgtie of the civil war notably the
provision that no state shall deprive any person of ue
liberty or property without due process of law nor deny
to any person the equal protec tion of the laws
finally the reservation of certain rights to the people of
the united states by the 10th amendment adopted in 1790
prevents the states from exercising any powers which though not
expressly delegated to the national government nor prohibited to the
states are essential to the preservation of the sovereignty of
the union the people of the several states are sub
ject to the sovereignty of the people ol the union
but the peonle of each state are equal to those
of any other before the law of the constitution congress
may admit new states to the union imposing such conditions
as it may deem suitable as the price of admission
but once within the sacred edifice a new state becomes
the peer of the others the powers which the states
may exercise though limited are nevertheless very extensive and highly
im lortanl they include among others the fol owing 1
the power to establish and main tain organized governments state
and local subject to the limitation that they be republi

both in state and in national elections subject to the
limitation that no citizen be deprived of the vote on
account of race color or previous condition of servitude 3
the power to levy and collect taxes except upon the
instruments of the national government and upon interstate and foreign
commerce 4 the police power including ampe power to enact

of law or denied the equal protec tion of the

the supply of psrtilic services of all lands except the
com paratively few such as the post office which are

the power to create corporations and trusts and 7 to
deal with the whole subject of private law including the

dejpitc the growing centraliza tion of government in the united
states cvi denced by the adaption of the isth amendment
to the federal constitutioo the socalled pro hibition amendment the
powers of the state in as they were in the
beginning more til juchta of the statmthe basis of tbe
state is the constitution of the united sutes bat the
basis of state govenunent is the state constitution the original
state constitutiodi adopted at the time of the revqluiton com
tained i an enacting clause 2 a frame of government
3 a schedule and 4 in most cases a declaration
of rights in some cases there was also a preamue
setting forth the reasons for the adoption of a state
consutu tion and intended to justify the overthrow of the
former government the declaration of rights ordinarily comprised a statement
of the political philosophy of the revolution and of the
dvu rights claimed for the people the political philosophy was
not radically different troin that set forth nearly a hondred
years earlier by john lacke in justification of the english
revolution of 16ss the civil rights were of two kinds
i abstract rits sudi as the right to freedom of
uieech and of the press and 2 concrete rights such
as the rit to the writ of kiibeas corput and
to tnal by jury practically it was upon the latter
innd of rights that tbc former were de pendent for
their force the declarations of abstract rits to be sure
had their effeci upon pubbc tiniob and thereby indirectly upon
the conduct of government but the sys tem of trial
by jury enabled the people to im pose a direct
check upon the acts of those in authority the schedule
dealt with such matters as the boundaries of the state
and the transition from the provisional to die con stituuchial
government the frame of govern ment was a body of
mles for the organization of the government and the division
of powers between its several branches it also regu lated
to some entent the conduct of elections and the procedure
of the legislative executive and judicial departments the enacting clause
expressed the purpose of the constitution and set forth its
sanction in the will of the people the existine slate
constitutions contain in addition to the foregoing a good deal
of ordi tiary legislative matter inserted from time to time
by state constitutional the purpose of putting it beyond the
reach of ordinary legislatures some of this matter is important
such as measures for the regula tion of the liquor
traffic but much of it is ccnnparatively trivial the stiff
nige the fundamental organ of goveminent in the states is
the electorate the right to vote was originally conferred onw
on those who were deemed to have a sufbctent interest
in the welfare of the state and who were otherwise
fit manhood suf frage did not exist during the first
half of the 19th century it was established in substan
tially all the states so far as white men were
concerned and after the civil war the ballot was extended
to the frecdmen meanwhile a reaction had set in against
the principle of manhood suffrage first literacy qualifica tions were
established in several northern state to exclude uneducated foreign bom
voters and then qualifications of various kinds were established m
the southern states to ex cde negro voters at present
quaktications designed to restrict the franchise to those who are
deemed fit exist in just half the states the extension
of the ballot to women on the same tenns as
to men began in the territories of the west equal
suffrage for men and women now exists in more than
a third of the states and in several others women
may vote for presidential electors and most local ofiicers though
not for governor and members of the state lslature there
is a larger number in which they may vote in
certain local elections particularly in public school elections the 19th
amendment to the federal constitution will however put an end
to disfranchise ment on account of sex in most states
the voters must be registered at least in the larger
cities in order to exercise their right in most states
also the ballots ate printed and elections are conducted by
blic officials at public expense the collection and expendi ture
of money by candidates for election and by potitical parties
is generally regulated by law and corrupt practices are carefully
defined and pnohibited state legillatniei the state legislatures consist of
two branches the lower branch generally called the house of
representatives contains aa a nile from two to three times
as many members as the upper which is always called
the senate the number of members of the lower branch
ranges from 35 in ari zona and delaware to 402
in new hampshire the nnmber of senators ranges from 17
in delaware to 63 in minnesota in most states the
county is the basis of representation in both branches of
the legislature various mediods of apportionment nave been adopted for
the purpose of adjusting reigtresentation more or less accurately to
population but in many states there is deliberate discrimination against
the larger cities in the apportionment of members the term
of members of the lower branch is two years in
almost all states and that of senators in the majority
of states is four years members of the legislature are
paid in all states in most stales the rates are
low in some they are no more than the wages
of unskilled manual laborers in most states the legislature meet
regularly once in two years and the length of the
session is gen google stattt oovskhuxht erally limited i the
r less strictly limited by the slate oonstitutions the legislative
powers are con ferred equally on both branches with the
ex ception that money bills niust originate in the lower
the senates are also entrusted with certain executive and judicial
powers notably the power of confirming executive appoint ments and
of trying impeachments when brought by the lower branch in
practice the latter power has proved of little importance whilst
the former has made the senate an ex ceedingly important
factor in executive affairs in all states where the executive
has much satronage in general the working of the igislatures
has been the least satisfactory feature of state government the
ooreraor most of the state con etitniions declare that the
governor shall be the chief executive magistrate but few con
stitutions actually confer on him the powers necessary and appropriate
for a chief execu tive his principal associates are generally
elected like himself directly by the people and for terms
as long as his own it is con sequently impossible
for him to direct them in the conduct of their
offices though in all slates the governor may appoint some
of the department heads and members of administra tive boards
and commissions his power of re fnoval is often surrounded
with restrictions which render him more or less of a
figurehead in the actual conduct of administration the importance of
the office of governor results mainly from its political powers
notably the power to recommend measures to the consid eration
of the legislature and to veto bills which though passed
the legislature are objection able in most states the veto
power extends to the veto of items in airopriation bills
thus giving the governor a specialty strong position with respect
to appropriations the stale constitutions further provide that an executive
veto may be overridden by special majorities in the lslature
but in several states where a twothirds majority of all
the dected members in each branch is required to pass
a measure over a veto it is exceedingly difficult in
practice to do it moreover in states where the length
of legislative sessions is strictly limited most of the measures
are paed in the last days of the session and
the executive veto is not exercised upon them un til
after the session has closed thus the gov ernor has
come to be the chief legislator rather than the chief
executive of the state administrative agencies the expansion of the
administrative activities of the states in recent years has caused
a great increase in the number of separate administrative agencies
in new york there were more than iso scle ra
tc administrative agencies in 1915 and in several states there
were over loo some of these separate administrative agencies such
as lax commissions railroad and public serv ice commissions industrial
commissions and departments of health and various special boards and
offices charged with the adminis tration of laws for the
regulation of industry and the protection of labor exercise impor
tant powers in practice they are much more subject to
oontrol by the courts than by the nominal chief executive
of the state in a few states appointments to minor
places in the administrative service are made from lists of
applicants certified as competent by state dvil service commissions but
in most stales i pointments are made by the governor
or the department heads at their discretion except so far
as limited by the requirement of sena torial confirmation or
by special conditions laid down by law in general political
considera tions outweigh considerations of fitness too often for the
good of the public service econ omy and efficiency in
slate administration tend to suffer from neglect the judiciary the
state judiciary are elected directly by the people in threefourths
of the states in the outers tiiey are appointed by
the governor or elected by the legislature in the central
and western states popular elec tion is universal terms of
supreme court judges vaiy from two years in vermont to
21 years in pennsylvania but in most states the term
ranges from 6 to 12 years in massachu setts the
judges hold office during good be havior like federal judges
salaries as in the case of other state elective officers
are in most states comparatively low terms of judges of
lower courts are nerally shorter and salaries lower the organization
of die courts is generally rcrtdated in the state con
stitutions in most states it is highly decen tralized mastrates
courts of various kinds exercise a limited jurisdiction in the
towns and cities above them in most of the states
are the county courts apd between the latter and the
highest court of the state there are as a rule
one or more intermediate courts with varying original and appellate
jurisdictions the states are generally divided into fixed judi cial
districts in order to localize these inter mediate courts and
a separate court with a prescribed number of judges is
organized in each district the resulting judicial system is highly
inelastic and rot infreobently ical and inefficient on the whole
he working of the judicial system is r factory than
that of either of the other prin cipal departments of
state gvemment amendment of state conatitlitiobt two different modes have
been provided in almost all states for the revision and
amendment of state constimtions one is by the constitu tional
conventidn the organization and pro cedure of constitutional conventions is
far from uniform in some states a corrvention may be
called by the legislature at any time in others the
approval of a majority of the voters is required before
a convention may be called in some states the number
and manner of election op delegates to a convention is
regu lated by the constitution in others the legisla ture
may determine the numbers and manner of election most conventions
however are actually organized upon the model of the lower
branch of the legislature in some states a convention may
put the revised constitution when agreed upon in force without
further reference lo the people in most states refer ence
to the people is required or is practiced without any
spedal requirement the otiier mode of constitutional change is by
the pitgt posal of specific amendments by the legislature subject
to approvaj by a majority of the voten the dy
google 8tatx oovsknlfkhts in some states a proposed amendment mmt
be adopted by two successive legislatures before it can be
submitted to the jftopie in others adoption by one legislature
is enough in all states the legislature must approve a
proposed atncndnieat by more than a tere majority vote recently
betptuiing in oregon in 1902 a fourth of the states
have established another mode of coiistitatiodal amendment not retniiring ac
tion b the legiilature or by any ouier repre sentative
body this is the socalled con stitutional initiative upon petition
of a pre scribed number of voters a proposed amend
ment is placed directly on the ballot and may be
adopted by a majority of the voters the initifttiva a
larger omnber of states beginning with south dakota in 1898
have established the statutory initiative upon peti tion of a
prescribed number of voters an ordi nary leginative measure may
be proposed for adoption directly by the voters this pro
cedure for direct legislation by the people is generally associated
with the direct popular referendum a device by means of
which the voters may veto a measure which though en
acted t the legislature is objectionable to them in 1919
the statutory initiative existed in 19 states and the popular
referendum in 21 stales in some of these notably oren
california ariiona and colorado the initia tive and referendum have
been freely used in prty syatem actual government in the
states is profoundly affected by the existence of the party
system in most of the states the political party is
recognized by law as an in strument of government in
all of them the iwminalion of candidates for elective office
is entirely in their control and to a considerable extent
the nomination of candidates for ap pointive office is practically
vested in the leaders of the party organizations a political
party is commonly defined as an association of voters which
at the last preceding election polled not less than a
certain number of votes or a certain percentage of the
total vote for some rresentalive office this qualification is usually
easy o meet a political party when recognized becomes entitled
to the exclusive use of a par name and in
most states where illiterates may vote also a party emblem
which assists the ilfiteratc in marking his ballol the number
of recognized parties varies but in most states is at
least three and in some as many as six only
two parties however are anywhere of major importance and in
many states one of these is generally much more successful
than the other in most states the major gardes are
now required to make their nominations at primary elections which
are conducted by public election clicers at public expense in
some of these states the voter may attend the official
primaries and help nominate the candidates of any party be
chooses without divulging his party affiliation in the greater number
of states however he must declare his party affiliation before
he can participate in the nomination of candidates the voters
declarations being checked by a system of party enrolment the
organization of the parties also is commonly regulated by law
and the members of the party com mittees like the
candidates for public office are selected at the primnries the
regulation by law of the methods of nomination has been
accomplished for the most part within the last quarter of
a century and the establishment of die direct primary system
has been the work of the last 15 years taken
together with the introduction of the australian or secret affigt
dal ballot the legal recognition of parties and the regulation
of their proceedings has brought a great improvement in the

state systems of education the government of the united states
has never exercised control or supervision over public education the
american people were not prepared for a national system of
education when the foundation of the national govern ment was
established by the adoption of the constitution of the united
states that docu ment does not therefore contain a single
pro vision in relation to the subject of education there
was not that common mutual interest in the social industrial
commercial and political relations between the several states which later
gradually developed among them there was much prejudice and even
fear against the gtwer of a centralized national government he
idea of state control in ali matters pos sible prevailed
to a large extent among the people of all the
states while the subject of education was not regarded generally
by the national leaders as one to receive their con
sideration there were men in all parts of the country
who recognized the vital need of es tablishing schools for
the education of all children even in colonial days this
idea had strong support in many of the colonies notably
in massachusetts new york connecticut rhode island new jersey and
pennsylvania the dutch settlers brought with them the ideas of
governmental institutions which pre vailed in holland in the dutch
settlements schools had generally been established the english dissenters also
brought with them their beliefs on social problems and they
also organized schools in their settlements when states were organized
and institutions were being developed to meet the social needs
of a progressive people the influences which had been created
by these forces were bound to be a potent factor
in these states therefore the estabhshment of schools received early
consideration the british evacuated the city of new york in
november 1783 and within two months from that lime governor
george qinton was urging upon the legislature of new york
the need of schools in the follow ing language ndn
thing by utiifbcumlv udt to e supn beim hi put
wlty and virtu lytht ottwrints n enlihter edund rmnndin gradually
each state by legislative enact ment either continued the schools
estabushed by the colony or authoriied the establishment of new
schools in many cases special acts conferred upon a particular
community the anthority to maintain a school the general laws
authorizing and requiring all communi ties in the state to
provide sdiools were en acted state aid was gradually extended
thus through a process of legislation there was gradually established
a system of education in every state in the union
by this methocl the accepted policy of the nation in
relation to public education was adopted and that policy is
the voluntary action of each state in organ izing and
maintaining a state systin of public education when the practice
of a state upon a subject has been continued for
a long period of years so that such practice beccnnes
die fixed policy of the state the people of the
state usually express that policy in their slate con stitution
when new states are admitted to the union such states
adopt a constitution and it has been the settled practice
of the newer states to incorporate in their constitu tions
a provision requiring the maintenance of a system of free
schools as the constitu tions of older states have been
revised a pro vision relating to education has been incor
porated in such constitutions the state of new york which
enacted a general law estab lishing a statewide school system
in 1812 did not include an article in her constitution
in relation to education until 1894 nearly every stale in
the union has writjen in its constitution a provision requiring
the maintenance of a system of free common schools these
constitutional provisions are similar to the following minnesota bik i

government has not assumed direction and control of education throughout
the cotm try it has not been interested in public
educa tion on the contrary the government has given aid
in various forms to the support of education in the
states for nearly a century in 1836 the national government
distributed several million dollars of surplus fimds among the states
in 1862 the national land grant act was passed this
was followed by the second morrill act the nelson law
the adams law the smithlever law and in 1917 by
the smithhughes act the national government has given for public
education nearly one hun dred million acres of land it
has also established various agencies which exercise functions in relation
to the educational affairs of the country the bureau of
education in the department of the interior and the federal
board for voca tional education are two important agencies dealing
with education it appears that more than 80 other agencies
which have official rela tions in one way or another
with the school sys tems of the several states have
also been eslab d google stats systems of education lished

on the part of the national government and the activities
of the nation in promoting the interests of edu cation
throughout the country education in america remains subject to the
control and direction of the several states even under the
terms of the bill pending in congress the con trol
of education by the several stales remains undistui4ied under this
general plan which has en fol lowed in administering educational
affairs there has grown up in america a fundamental prin
dple of school administration which is becom ing more pronounced
and more controlling year l year that principle is that
education is a state function and that all the schools
of a stale constitute one systema state system in other
words the schools maintained in a dty or a school
district are not independent detached systems but they are a
part of the state system and subject to general control
and direction by the state the fact that local officers
are selected by popular vote or are ap pointed by
a mayor das not make these offi cers local or
dty officers or the schools local or city schools these
school officers are ofb cers chosen by a method determined
by the le and for the performance of state func
tions and the sdioola are a part of a state
system there is pro4ably no question related to the administration
of public schools which is of greater importance at the
present time than the distinction between local control and state
con trol all powers exercised by local school offi cers
in the administration of schools are powers delegated by the
state through legislative enact ment and may be modified or
revoked by the agency which conferred them local control often
means municipal control and the greatest obstacle that has stood
in the way of educa tional progress in the dties
of this country has been the control or domination of
school af fairs by municipal officers where such domi nation
has existed the schools have very n erally been administered
upon the same political ajid partisan bases which have governed
the ad ministration of munidpal affairs in several of the
leading dties of the country the mayors and other munidpal
officers are attempting to override the statutes regulating the administra
tion of the schools to obtain control of the management
of such schools and to establish the general policy imder
which they shall be governed itiis mterference of miuiidpal offi
cers has resulted in legislation in many states to make
more secure the right and the author ity of school
officers to administer the schools the decisions of the courts
have uniformly in the several states sustained the cardinal prindple
that education is a matter of general concern to the
state and subject lo the states general control and direction
an examination of the leading cases dedded by the courts
of the several states in rdalion to the control and
supervision of public educa tion will show that the following
fundamental prindples of school admiiuatratiqnl have been dearly established 1
public education is a state function or a subject under
the control and supervision of the state systems of education
which have been established in the several states but ad
2 the officers chosen to administer laws enacted to operate
and maintain a school system in various localities throughout the
slate are not local cers neither are they town village
or dty officers but public or stale officers per forming
duties for the public at large 3 when the officers
of a dty are authorized to perform some duty in
connection with the operation or maintenance of public schools as
the appointment of members of a board of edu cation
by the mayor or the collection of taxes for school
purposes by a city treasurer such dty officers do not
act in the discharge of such duties as mimidpal oflicers
but as special offi cers exerdsing a power devolved upon
them to administer a function of goveniment for the benefit
of all the citizens of the state 4 the laws
relating to the schools of a dty which are written
in the charter of such dty are a part of
the school laws of the state and not a part
of the charter or law of the dty in support
of these fundamental principle the following excerpts are taken from

in 1876 james n gerard inspector of schools in the
city of new york was elected lo the state senate
his seat in that body was con tested by his
opponent william laimbeer upon the ground that the constitution provided
mat a municipal olcer shall not be eligible to elec
tion to the leeislature the committee on judi ciary reported
adversely to the claim of the peti tioner and on
its recotnmendation the senate adopted the following preamble and resolution

late stale commissioner of edu cation dr andrew s draper
was a member of the board of education of the
city of albany he was elected to the assembly his
seat was also contested upon the same ground that the
seat of senator gerard was contested the report of the
committee on contested seats which was an exhaustive treatment of
the ques tion and to the effect that a member
of a board af education was not a municipal officer
was unanimously adopted assembly journal 1881 volume i pases 716727
it is not contended not even suggested that the state
control and direction of education which is urged in this
article means a state monopoly of educational affairs such a
scheme of education would he repugnant lo the whole american
idea of education state direction and control of public education
means simply that the state shall clearl assert its duty
and obligation to the people and shmll guarantee to them
full protection in their rights and needs in a matter
so vitsi to their happiness and prosperity it has been
a wise procedure on the part of the stales to
establish in their state school organiistiong a local school autonomy
such action gives to a community the right to provide
school facilities which shall not only satisfy the standard prescribml
by the state hut to provide even higher standards if
the wealth the commercial needs and prosperity the social and
intellectual attainments and the sentiment of their people will support
them the administration of public education on the basis of
the state instead of the nation has resulted in great
incqnality of educational fadk tics in the varions slates of
the union some states because of their wealth and population
are able to provide for the children of such states
school facilities which cannot be provided by the sparsely settled
and less wealthy states it is unnecessary to enumerate all
of these in equalities but eomc are indicated the schocd
term ranges in the several states from 108 days per
year to 194 days per year in 11 states the
period of the school term is less than 140 da
the average niunber of days which each child attends school
ranges from 55 in one state to 134 in another
in 20 of the states the average number of days
in the school term is 90 or less and in
30 of the states it does not exceed 100 days
the expense per capita of the average days attendance in
north caro lina is 1231 while it is 8636 in
montana the minimum period of compulsory attendance ranges from four
months in one state to the full school year in
30 states it may be said however that in several
states having a com pulsory attendance law such law is
not en forced it should be further noted that it
has taken onehalf a century of hard work to write
into the statutes the compulsory attendance laws of the several
states the stference in the qualifications of teach ers provided
for the scuools of the several states also results in
an inequality of educa tional opportunity for the children residing
in such states it is known that in some states
young people 6 years of age and even under such
age are employed as teachers in 19 of the states
there is no minimum requirement for teachers employed in the
p lie schools in a majority of the states large
numbers of teachers are emplojjed whose edu cation has been
obtained solely in the element ary school in many states

this official is a fiscal school officer under tile duties
imposed upon him by law and tiot s leader directing
and stimulating the educational attairs of his state a constitutional
mandate requiring the maintenance of free schools throughout a state
must be interpreted to mean that so far as pos
sible the system of common schools established throughout the state
shall provide egiml educa tional opportunities for all the children
of the state it does not mean that a state
school system may be established which must of neces sity
hy its very form of organization give to the children
of one section of the state or of any community
in the state educational facili ties which are denied tfie
children of another section or of another community it must
also be held that under this provision of the consti
tution a state school system must be established which imposes
equal hurdens upon the taxpay ers who support such system
inequality of taxation for school lurposes is unequality of edocational
opportunity a school system therefore whose administration imposes an in
equality of taxation and which does not pro vide equal
educational otportunities does not conform to the letter or the
spirit of the con stitution and should be modified in
many slates funds have been established the revenue of which
is used for the support and maintenance of schools in
nearly all states provision is made by which funds arc
appropriated from the state treasury for the suptgtort and maintenance
of schools and porlioned by the chief school officer of
the state to the various districts or cities state in
some states as in california new york pennsylvania new jersey
minnesota and washington large appropriations are made by the state
for the support of the schools the balance which is
needed in any district or city to meet the expense
of the maintenance of schools after applying state funds is
raised by local taxation nearly alt the states main tain
state normal schools for the training of teachers for the
public school system and not only construct the buildings at
state expense but meet all the expenses of maintenance and
operation there is a tendency in legislation on educa tional
matters to follow the general policy of the whole country
in legislation upon other important subjects and to establish in
a greater dee state uniformity direction and super vision in
educational matters in several states provision has been made for
minimum salaries of teachers for the uniform certification of teachers
for the retirement of teachers for the supervision of schools
for couipulsory attend ance for medical inspection afld health instruc
tion of pupils and for the constniction of sani tary
and safe school building in some stales the administration of
pub lic education is lughly centralized under the direction of
the chief educational officer of the stale this is noubly
true in the state of new york in such stale
the commissioner of education prescribes the conditions on which students
may enter state normal schools he prescribes the courses of
study in the state normal scboola he has the final
amiroval of teachers appointed in such institutions and he appoints
the members of the local boards in charge of the
administration of such schools the examination and certification of teachers
is in accordance with rules and regulations which he jtrescribes
he is authorised by law to prescribe by regulation the
functions of dis trict supenntendeots who supervise rural schools he
may also by regulation impose upon dty supcrintendutts and boards
of edu cation throughout the slate duties in the ad
ministration of the schools he may condemn scfaoolhoiises in any
part of the state and re quire new buildings to
be erected he has judi cial authority in detemuning all
school con troversies arising throughout the state and his dedskms
in such matters are final and not sub ject to
review by the courts the tendency througboot the country is
strongly toward greater centrafication this is due to the fact
that education is more and more recognised as a matter
to which tfat state must five more careful direction and
stipervision a law which is statewide can be made stronger
and more elective than a local law a general statute
ii there are three distinct systems of local ad ministration
of schools in operation in this conn try these are
known as the district system the township system and the
county system the cfistrict ytem is the one which was
first estab lished when it was first necessary to organ
ize schools a few families living in the same neighborhood
associated themscitea together employed a teacher and maintained a school
when school systems were organized in slates which had adopted
this syslem the organisation already established was utilized and in
some of the states as in new york that system
is still in operation in each town througliout a state
in which this system is in operation there are several
separate school districts each of these ustricts maintains an independent
organization with its own local officers and each is a
tax district so that in each township there are all
the way from 8 to 35 separate and independ ent
authorities in charge of the schools of a single town
and possessing the power to assess taxes upon the property
of such districls for the maimenance of schools this kind
of an organization for the administration of rural schools has
been demonstrated to be cumber some obsolete and inefficient this
system has been discontinued in many states and must be
in all states before rural schools can be im proved
and modernized and enabled to serve the people of the
agricultural sections as the schools should and as present conditions
de in new england and many of the western states
the township is the unit of administra tion under such
systems a town board of education is usually chosen at
a town school meeting and is given general authority over
the supervision and administration of all the schools of a
town in other words it is the substitution in rural
communities of an lical and professional system in the ad
ition of schools for the inefficient and unbusinesslike plan which
is followed in school districts generally where the school district
sys d google wmi state taxation staiv univxhsitib8 tern is
in operation it oives all the schools of a town
the same businesslike mancement which is generally afforded in cities
where all the schools are under the control and supervision
of one board of education in most of the western
states the general form of vemment followed in administering public
affairs has been followed in the administration of school mat
ters in these states the county is the imit of
sdiool administration where is system pre vails there is a
coimty board of education and a county superintendent of schools
these offi cers perform the functions which are generally performed
in towns and districts by me town and district boards
the local school officers whether under the district town or
county system have the direct charge of the administration and
operation of the schools these officers employ the teach ers
determine the period of time school must be maintained beyond
the period required by law determine the salary to be
paid in advance of that required by statute make repairs
to buildings construct new buildings purchase supplies and equipment and
perform such other functions as may be required to operate
the schools or to make effective a state plan of
education a sound effective equitable state svstem of education must
rest upon a legal foimaatioa similar to the following 1
there should be a constitutional mandate which requires the legislature
to provide for a free system of common schools this
consti tutional provision should require school officers for every unit
of school adnu lustration in the siaic with powers not
conditioned in any way whatever upon the action of municipal
otticcrs it should also provide for raising such funds as
are necessary for the operation of the schools in other
words the absolute manage ment and control of the schools
independent of all local municipal authority should be uaran teed
the school authorities by the constitution it should further require
the establishment of a state department of education with sufbcient
authority to administer a sound progressive educational policy 2 the
legislature should confer on the chief educational officer of the
state sufficient power and provide him with sufficient funds to
be a real leader of power and influence in directing
and supervising the educational activities of the state 3 a
unit of school administration and tax ation for the rural
communities should be es tablished embracing not less than the
territory of the town so that rural school facilities may
be provided which shall be equal so far as may
be possible o the facilities provided in the cities and
other populous centres 4 state aid in much larger proportion
than has yet been provided should be furnished and distnbuted
upon a basis which shall enable the community having less
property values to maintain schools which shall give the children
in these less favored sections advantages as nearly equal as
may be possible to those ad vantages afforded children whose
homes are in more favored centres thou as e finecan

see taxatioif state universities the general statement the history of
education hardly offers a parallel to the rise and growth
of stale supported institutions for higher learning in the united
states during the ialler part of the 19th and the
first decade of the 20th century in 1875 20 such
institutions had been founded but a very few had risen
to any kind of educa tional prominence they bad at
that time a total registration of 2340 students in 1885
26 institutions enrolled 4599 students in 1903 36 institutions enrolled
41369 students on 30 june 1917 according to the latest
available figures issued by the united states bureau of education
there were 90 institutions in die states and territories of
the republic sup ported in whole or in part by
public funds and offering collegiate or professional courses beyond the
range of the secondary school with faculties numbering 12368 persons
a total enrolment of 13838 students and a total annual
working income of upward of 60000000 this movement is not
only unrivaled in the history of education it is also
perhaps the most significant and promising development in the history
of our democracy the sentiment which supports the movement is
practicy uni versal and it is the product of the
spirit of the pioneers of the central and western states
thiriyniae slates now tax themselves without stint to provide a
practically free education or their sons and for their aaugklers
from the kindergarten dirough the college and in many instances
through the professional school as well the nine states which
do not have reg ularly designated stalesupported universities nevertheless contribute
very generously to the support of hier education and maintain
or help to maintain institutions which serve in part at
least to perform the functions so admi sin and illinois
tile nine stales which do not have state universities as
the term is now commonly imderstood are connecticut dela ware
maryland massachusetts new ham shire new jersey new york pennsylvania
and rhode island no people have ever before carried forward
such a movement on any similar scale in the i
early days massachusetts and connecticut and i new york and
new jersey gave substantial aid to harvard and yale and
columbia and princeton but without any idea of becoming responsible
for their permanent support ana management the common thought as
to the functions of government touching education would not permit
more than state aid and en couragement to a university
in the colonial days or even in the earlier years
of the re public the settlement of the great west
opened the way for a new educational order of things
the pioneers built for the future and the were especially
anxious that ample pro vision should be made by the
state for the edu cation of their children nearly all
the state universities are open to women on an equal
footing with men and the tuition in collegiate courses is
free or onh a nominal sum the tuition in the
profession schools is ordinarily higher but is not based upon
the theory ot an adequate finaldcial r google state univbksmss
tarn for the expense involved indeed the state universities more
than an other agency have been resfkinsiue far reraovinz professional
schools in recent years from the realm of commercial enterprises
this is particularly and fortunately true of the profession of
medicine llie state universities in common with a few highly
endowed and thoroughly reputable private institutions have demonstrated that the
teaching of medicine as it ought to be taugfit is
not and cannot be a profitmaking business all classes arc
represented in the reat student bodies of the typical state
universities but the middle class predominates overwhelm ingly there are
many students who find it necessary to work their way
and if they do it and sustain themselves in their
university wohc ihey uniformly gain the respect they de serve
for it young men and young women work side by
side in classrooms and labora tories they attend social gatherings
in com pany with little in the way of regulation
which is not selfimposed and with ue very best results
life is free and genuine and natural and earnest and
the sentiment of the campus is wholesome more than that
the spint of the tyincal slate university is widely regarded
as the most splendid promise of our democrac hiatoriud developmeat
as has been in dicated althou all the colleges established
in early or colomal days were private corpora tions they
were in nearly every instance the willing recipients of public
bequests this in vestment of public funds naturally carried with
it ihe hought of state control but the earbr colleges
were all more or less under denomi national supervision and
did not satisfy the de mands of ihe people as
a whole the growing spirit of democracy is resnonsible for
uie birth oif the state university strangely enough as it
may now seem because of the marvelous prog ress of
public education elementary secondary and higher in the north and
west in recent decades the south took the lead in
this early movement for publicly supported institutions for higher tearmng
the constitution of north carolina framed in 1776 provided that
all use ful learning shall be promoted and encouraged in
one or more universities an iastitntion was founded upon the
provision of this clause in 1789 and came into the
full control of the state in 1821 but the fullest
development of the state university was to be reached in
the newer states in the uiddlc west the con stitutior
of indiana which is typical provided in 1819 that it
shall be the duty of the general assembly as soon
as circumstances will permit to provide by taw for a
general system of edu cation ascending in regular gradation from
township schools to state university wherein tuition shall be gratis
and equally open to all impetus was given to the
establishment of state universities in 1862 by the passage of
the morrill act by congress this act granted to each
state 30000 acres of public land for each senator and
representative in congress to which the state was entitled under
the census of i860 all money derived from the sale
of these lands was to be invested by the state
in securities bearing interest at not less than 5 per
cent ex cept that the legislature of the state might
aothoiise the use of not more than 10 per cent
of the capital for the purchase of sites for a
college or experimental farms the in terest was to be
used for the endowment sup port and maintenance of at
least one college where the leading object should be to
teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture
and the mechanic arts in order to promote the liberal
and practical education of the industrial classes in the several
pursuits and professions of life of the colleges bene aling
under the act kenincky mississippi south carolina and virginia divide
the income be tween an instituticni for whites and cme
for col ored students with the exception of massa chusetts
which divides the fund between two colleges each of the
other states maintains one college or university to receive the
benefit of the fund nineteen slates have created and maintain
indepeudent colleges of agriculture and die mechanic arts while also
maintaining state universities in each of 21 states the college
of agriculture is a part of the state univeity twentyeight
states were allotted 8160000 acres of land in scrip 20
states received 2890 000 acres in place the scrip and
lands have been sold for 1264330943 each state now apphes
all the income for the support of the agricultural and
mechanical college the total income for 191314 was 85631895 among

with the inception of state universities as has been indicated
the income from the fund and from supplementary acts is
a very small part of the amount now ex pended
vmually by the several slates for the furtherance of hifr
education the principal sources of income in addition to federal
land grants are student fees gifts and slate ap propriations
as has been noted fees are merely nominal in all
undergraduate courses and are not calculated upon a commercial basis
in the professional schools while the state univer ties have
never strongly relied upon gifts many have profited by donations
at various times this is notably true of georgia indiana
kan sas michigan minnesota and north caro lina the university
of virginia received a gift of 2000000 in 1909 from
andrew carne gie and others the university of wisconsin and
the university of california have each been greatly enriched by
private gifts the google 8tatk unfvbrsittba chief source of income

oruiivfttioti and administntioii the supervision and control of the typical
state university is vested in a board of regents or
trustees usuaily appointed by the governor with the consent of
the senate in a few instances the rfents or trustees
are chosen by the people at a general state election
this is true in lui nois and nebraska there have
been a few conspicuous departures from the general rul but
in the main these boards have been singu larly free
from political interference and have as a natural consequence drawn
to their mem bership representative citizens goierall inter ested in
the promotion of sound education and been able to act
disinterestedly upon all im portant questions coming before them in
indi ana university the alumni have a voice in the
selection of the trustees and the influence of the alumni
is coming to be felt indirectly in the selection of
governing boards througnout the country it is not unusual to
find one or more graduates on the board of an
institution and the tendency i ibat direction is growing in
practice the theory that boards legislate and individuals act or
execute is the guiding principle in determining the relations of
the governing board and the president this prin ciple of
procedure has not been established with out a struggle and
regents or trustees without conception of their duties and with
an inordi nate desire to nin their institutions have more
than once caused serious trouble the typical management of a
stale university to d is not unlike that of the
average bank where the board of directors act in an
advisory ca pacity only and leave the management of the
daily business of the bank entirely in the hands of
the executive officers accordingly the po sition of president of
a great state university is a digmfied one and calls
for welltrained executive powers as well as for seasoned scholarship
almost universally the president is in fact as well as
in name the real executive head of his institution turrmg
to his board for advice or for endorsement of general
plans in the matter of appointments and resignations upon the
faculty the president initiates action and goes to his legislative
board only for the confirmation or veto of his recommendations
men like angetl at michigan northrop at minnesota and draper
at illinois through the free exercise of their reat executive
powers and by the force of their characters had much
to do in determining methods of univeraly pro cedure which
have now widely become un written laws and which have
in many instances indeed been written into university statutes while
the president is given large executive powers the very widest
latitude in the interior management of the state university is
given to the deans and the faculties of the several
colleges and the relations of administrative offi notably harmonious the
organization of the typical state univer sity may be understood
by notiue the actual conditions at the university of illinois
the board of trustees consists of 12 members three of
whom the governor the president of the state board of
agriculture and the state super intendent of public instructioi are
exofkcio members the nine other inembers are elected by the
people and serve for terms of six years each three
being elected every second year the board appoints the president
who is the general executive officer the chief adminis trative
officers below the president are the vice president the deans
of the collies the registrar the comptroller the dean of
men the dean o women the adviser to foreign students
the faighschool visitor the execu tive secretary the dirccior of

ejigineering and ad ministration the one year medical college the

that the typical state uni versity practically undertakes with the
excep tionof theology to carry out the maxim of the

regarded of great value to the physical wellbeing of the
men and has been proved to be immensely worth while

wisdom of the prac tice and pvcs assurance that even
larger at tention will be given to such training in
the future on the whole it can be said that
the students welcome the drills and the accompany ing taste
of military discipline and it is certain that they are
universally glad of the experi ence as they look back
upon it the state uni versities have a unique opportunity
to lead the nation in a permanent program for adequate
preparedness in the future place in the bducational system the
state universities in many instances and espe cially in the
middle west are a deliberately planned and component part of
the educa tional system of their states the educational system
in a state which emphasizes such a plan may be
said to cover 16 years eight in the elementary school
four in the high school and four in the college
the articulation of the different parts is complete the grammar
school graduate passes into the high school witliout examination and
the graduate of the approved high school enters his stale
uni vermty without examination the slate uni versity in such
an instance is the natural cap stone of th state
s educational system the relation of the state universities very
gen erally to the schools below and especially lo the
bi schools is intimate and helpful the relation has its
personal and human side due to the intelligent and tactful
activity of uni versity high school visitors whose business it
is to visit and inspect high schools for the maintenance
of an accredited entrance list cordial relations are also further
cemented by frequent conferences at the universities of superintendents and
principals and teachers upon topics of mutual interest the hi
schools are invigorated and inspired by contact with the universities

unprecedented hut it has not been without heroic struggle the
people in every commonwealth almost especially in the middle west
and the far west have been united in their desire
for a state institution of higher learning but they have
rarely known how best to go about creating and building
such an institution it has remained for educational statesmen and
it has called for statesman ship of the highest order
to lay down the giiiding policies and educate the public
to a right appreciation of tts university singularly enough and
yet in a certain sense naturally enough too the very
ptiblic which has sought to promote the university has steadfastly
in sisted that it should prove its worth step by
step hardly a state university has not gone through the
period of being an outcast in the eyes of its
own constituents this means that patience and tact and disinterested
public serv ice is woven into the fabric of every

now well nigh over legislatures need no longer be convinced
of their legitimate place and func tion in the life

growth of the state uni versities has of itself changed

to count the most is to come through the build

however certain conditions must exist the communitj must be organized
with a population in numbers and character capable of upholding

requirements are in evidence the de cisions of congress however
have often been influenced by party reasons and in 1872
it was enacted that no state should be admitted there

it may be either centralized or federal if a the

if the will of the state is determined by balancing

the wellbeing of the social state as a whole is

government may be more efficient than a federal government but
wfiere intelli gence and education are generally diffused among a
people selfreliant and mutually tolerant a federal government is more
re sponsive to the variety of ideas which may characterize
a large state and is more likely to be permanent
autocracy may attain high efficiency but is usually attended by
tyranny while a democracy has a republican form of government
a republic is distinguished by an oligarchic tendency and a

italian word stall sta meaning statesman which in its turn
came from the latin status mean ing slate e a
w zimmerman professor of natural history at brunswick in 1787
in a work entitled a political survey of the present
state of europe gave this history of the origin of
the word and the science which it represents ii is
about 40 years ago that the branch of political knowledge
which has for its object the actual and relative power
of the several modern slates the power arising fram their
natural advantages the industry and civil ization of their inhabitants
and the wisdom of their governments has been formed chiefly
by the german writers into a separate science by the
more convenient form it has now received this science distinguished
by the new coined name of statistics is be come
a favorite study in germany at first the meinod of
approach was de scriptive but it was inevitable that figures
be cause of dieir greater simplicity and compact ness should
take a more and more prominent pan in the development
of the new science and finally replace the old verbal
form of exposition next as a man naturally pictures an
object in terms of its most prominent char acteristics it
was not long before the term statistics was transferred from
the science to the compilation of the facts and figures
in volved and finally to the arrays of facts them
selves thus we read in the first number of the
royal statistical society journal issued in 183839 statistics maybe said
in the words of the prospectus of this society to
be the ascertaining and bringing together of those facts which
are calculated to illustrate the con dition and prospects of
society the name having once come to be applied to
the data themselves it was but a short step to
the call ing of any compilation of figures or facts
statistics which is the modern usage of the term while
the science itself has come to be called the statistical
method the latter may be defined briefly as the science
of analy sis and exposition of quantitative or qualitative data
secured through enumeration or experi application of statisticsl method a
scope from this definition it may be seen that the
statistical method is found applied wherever compilation of facts are
given and accurate conclusions therefrom are wanted perhaps the most
common application is that of the governmental census the most
ancient of our literatures including the fourth book of the
bible the name of which denotes its reference to a
statistical subject abound in ref erences to the taking of
censuses in preparation for large undertakings such as the building
of pyramids military campaigns the distribution of lands and the
levying of taxes in modem times the taking of the
census has been made periodic in the united slates every
10 years and has been developed along very extensive lines
not only gathering ihe iampta but analys ing and illustrating
them as well the student vol is 34 will find
in these government re ports a wonderful wealth of data
on innumer able subjects but the statistical method is no
longer con fined to investigations such as the census by
governmental agencies for administrative or other lurposes today each large
corporation has its statistician and all policies of the con
cern are based on his findings very fre juently a
business concern has been changed rom a losing venture to
a great success by a new manager who installed scientific
methods based on a statistical study of the conditions affecting
the business rents of business loca tions in cities are
determined by a study of the number of people who
pass the place in fact modern industrial development has come
to depend more and more on statistical re search in
the sciences both physical and bio logical the statistical method
is of foremost importance the chemists who were given the
task of finding a suitable clay for spark plugs for
the liberty motor solved the problem by this method new
serums and medical treat ments are now subjected to the
severest statis tical tests before they are accepted by the
medi cal profession statistical analyses have en abled the chemist
to predict the existence of unknown elements with given atomic
weights and the astronomer to predict eclipses and lo cate
new planets the whole doctrine of evo lution and heredity
rests on a statistical basis as shown by investigations of
mr francis gal lon and prof karl pearson in the
fiejd of the mathematical theory of evolution and by the
work of gregor mendel and his followers along the lines
of mendels laws of alternative inheritance in the social sciences
especially in the field of economics the statistical method is
equally indispensable no economist would attempt to arrive at a
conclusion concerning the produc tion or distribution of wealth without
an ex haustive study of siaiistical data business men and
economists alike are convinced that only when congress bases its
tariff legislation upon a scientific study of the natural resources
and economic needs of the various parts of the country
will an equitable tariff law be passed careful analysis of
the effects of the english system of out relief the
granting of partial relief to paupers without ecnding them to
the poorhouse showed that the system was lower mg wages
and increasing instead of decreasing pauperism thus producing a social
evil whidi grew as it fed on itself in economics
and the other social sciences the old roman proverb is
preeminently true sine numero nihil dem onstrandum est in seeking
to apply the statistical method to any line of investigation
care must be taken to avoid certain errors likely to
be encountered where statistical data are inaccurately compiled or carelessly
applied one of the most common causes of error in
conclusions derived from statistical data is the lade of proper
definition of the elements entering into the problem con cerning
which data are being gathered other errors arise from careless
or premeditated abuse of data correct in themselves but leading
to erroneous conclusions when improperly used false statistical deductions may
result from in accuracy from slovenliness in gathering or ar
ranging data from partial statement of troth d google 5s0
statistical method from a comparison of heterogeneous qualities or from
lapses in logic the man who thought he had discovered
thai eminent mathematicians were remarkable for their longevity was cor
rect in his data but careless in their applica tion
he should have compared the average lenkth of life of
eminent mathematicians not witn the average length of life of
all human beings including those who die in infanni but
with the average length of life of men who at
tain intellectual maturity again it is manir festly unfair to
judge the skill of the physician bjr the number of
bis patients who have died without also considering the total
number he treated such abuse of statistics as the use
of the same set of figures to prove that prohibit
lion does prohibit and that it docs not prohibit has
to some extent destroyed the popular faith in statistics and
is responsible for the often heard expression you can prove
anything by figures statistics may be likened to a razor
a delicate and very effective tool when handled by an
expert but very dangerous lo an infant while care must
be taken that accuracy is pre served in the gathering
of statistics too great minutix in description defeats the object
sought if for instance we wish to study the distribu
tion of wageearners in industrial establish ments we will find
ourselves lost unless we effect a grouping into a few
classes as there is a rather small limit to the
number of im pressions which a mind can receive and
hold at one time closely related to this error of
excessive attention to minutiz of detail is the attempt at
greater accuracy in statistical de ductions than the facts themselves
warrant niere ia in statistics much swallowing of camels and
straining at gnats we are continually confronted with financial statistics
carried out to the last cent when many of the
individual items cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty
to within the nearest thousand or even million the young
man who wishing to know die circumference of a wagon
wheel muu tiplied the diameter obtained with a 35incb yard
stick with the value of ltr carried out to 18
decimals is illustrative of our ingrained but untrained desire for
accuracy that no resultant can be more accurate than the
least is altogether too often forgotten and much time and
labor have been spent in cltoris to secure precision not
warranted by the facts on the other hand no statistical
conclusions should be adopted without a statement indicating the degree
of reliance which may be placed on them it must
be borne in mind that statistics is the science of
large numbers that results ob tained from a few cases
cannot be considered representative and should therefore be received with
due caution it can readily be proved that the precision
of a determination is pro portional to the square root
of the number of observations but also that there is
a limit beyond which it does not pay to carry
the re finement b statiitical tables in employing the llatislical
method statistical tables both simple and complex are constantly brought
into use to illustrate the construction of these we will
use the problem referred to in a previous para saph
of the distribution of wageearners in e united states the
1910 census vol viil divides the industrial establishments of this
country into the following seven classes those employing i to
5 w age earn e rs 6 to 20 21
to 50 51 to 100 101 to 250 251 lo
1000 and over 1 000 we construct a tabje with
these seven classes in one column and in a second
column enter the number of establishments in each class for
comparative study we now enter in a third column the
number of establishments in each of these classes as ven
in the census of 1900 this sugijcsts a fourth column
givi the increase or decrease for each class and still
another column giving the proportions ex pressed as percentages which
such increase or decrease bears lo the figures given for
the earlier of the two years such a table is
called a simple statistical table similarly we may construct another
table but giving here the number of wageearners in each
class a combination of the two into a doublecolumn table
such as is given in the census of 1910 is
called a complex statistical table applying to this the proper
arithmetical operations gives ous interesting and important facts the use
of ike relative wkixk also know the proportion which these
numbers bear to the total this proportion is io general
best expressed as a percentage in vital statis tics however
it has become customary to use a radix number so
many deaths per tnousand for instance except in actuarial mathematics
where the formulae have been developed on this basis the
latter is not a good metnod as it does not
readily yield itself to mathematical treatment d graphic methods to
show vividly the facts compiled in statistical tables and the
conclusions to be deduced therefrom the statis tician uses various
graphic illustrations what the microscope is to the biolojtist and
the tele scope to the astronomer of like importance is
dus mechanical intcrprelalion or illustration of statistics to the statistician
the common houseqy is to the casual observer an uninter
esting and repulsive creature but the micro scope reveals it
as an object of wondrous struc ture and beauty similarly
a table vink the temperature taken each half hour durini
a cer tain day means very little to us but
the curve automatically drawn by a thermograph records the changes
in temperature momently and siill tells us its whole story
at a glance to construct such a frequency curve as
it is called where variation is reasonably continu ous as
in the above problem erect at equal intervals along a
horizontal line a series of vertical lines called ordinates proportional
in length to the number of objects in the classes
which th represenl then join the tops of these ordinates

because of the important prt which they play in statistics
the statistical method las been defined by some writers as
the scienfe of averages aver ages may be considerefl as
types through which we get sn adcquie conceptron of groups
variates and by meaiis of which comparisons with other groups
ifiay be effected thus though men of any rsce may
differ greatly in bcii we still get a very fair
conception of the relative stature of a patagonian indian an
englishman and a lapp when we leam that their average
heights are six feet one inch five feet seven itichcs
and five fet respectively the first real developinent of scientific
methods tm seatistical study came about through th needs of
astronomers for some means of secur ing accurate determinations from
their ever knowing slock of observational data it was found
crrore of observation were symmetricalty btoupcd about their arithmetic mean
where they were clustered most closely and decreas ing continuoushr
and equally in number in ao cordance with a certain
law called the normal law of errors as the observation
re ceded in either direction from the meanf this law
atso known as the law of probability or tbe law
of chance was found by the great belgian astronomer and
mathmatidan aques quetelet to govern not merely the distribution of
errors of measurement of inanimate things or direct the action
of blind chance such as ike mamier in which ctnns
when tossed turn up heads or tails but also the
chance dis tributions in the animate world whether dealing with
barometric bressure human height or the size of plants the
law was found to hold later it was found that
where a bias exists as for instanc tbe inclination of
the loaded cun to turn up one face more fre

as eco nomic unrest eye color or mental character istics
we cannot for instance state in figures the mental alertness
of a class of boys but we can readily arrange
them in the order of their intelligence and thus determine
the average boy in a normal distribution the mean the
median and the mode naturally coincide the arithmetic mean may
be subdivided into the simple and the weighted the simple
arith metic mean of two or more quantities is tiie
um of those divided by their number with out regard
to their respecdve weights or relalt tive importance the weited
mean is the simi of the quantities each multiplied by
its weight divided by the sum of uie weights the
difference can best be pointed out by some examples if
we wish to find the averse wage in an industry
we cannot do this by simply to the wages really
paid the true average is obtained weighting each wie by
the num ber of men receiring that wage adding the
stoducts and dividing by the number of men n this
case the weights are definitely detennin able numbers which it
not always the case an astronomer taking a series of
observadoni od a certain evening will average these as equally
good when however he wishes to combine observations taken on
different cven ines he may consider these sets as of
uneou value because of the unequal atmosjdteric coe ditioiu under
which the observatioiu were made he will then ttse as
weights munbers which in bis estimation fpve die relative val
ues of the observations an excellent exaac of the use
of weights is afforded by the mdex numbers for the
changes in wages or prices of commodities in comparing prices
of different years we find that tlugtugh some have increased
and others have decreased there has been a general tend
enqr in one direction to measure this tend ency that
is to determine the increase or de crease in the
purchasing power of money is one of the most important
tasks of the econo mist it is at once obvious
that we cannot solve the problem by taking the simple
arith metic mean of the prices of all commodities for
that would unduly accentuate the lesser things would for instance
give matches as great weight as coal instead we take
the most unnortant ones whose prices we can estimate rawer
accurately and tabulate for a number of years taking a
year as a base year we can then express me
prices of each other yearas percentages of those of the
base year the movement of prices during this interval in
the use of the mean as a tfpc it must
be remembered that it will not fairly rresent the group
if there is too great a divergence from it within
the groupl for instance sta tistics may show the same
per capita wealth say 1000 in two cities without giving
us any idea ai to the real prosperity of llie
inhabit ants the one diy may have the weth well
distributed with all oi its inhabitants pros perous and happy
while the other has its slums and its palaces wmi
only a small middle class if however to this per
capita avenge is appended another figure showing linuts wim in
wnich half the people come we can form a better
estimate of the economic condition of the city suppose in
the one case we find that this limit is 100
in excess or defect of die mean while in the
other it is 400 we would then give the per
capita wealth of the woich it tlpen ofl n averaging
the scales of wages paid in the vari ous occupations
if that were done the few highlypaid experts and superintendents
would count as much as the many common laborers and
so give a very misleading conception as cities as 1000
100 and 1000 400 elv in the one case onebalf
the people fall within the narrow class of more espectively
than 900 and less than 1100 ia the other the
limits would be 600 and 1400 this additive quantity is
called the probable error or probable deviation we are accortuogty
in die development of the statistical method interested not merely
in the average as a type but also in the
divergence of ue group from the type the best measure
of an aver age deviation from the mean is the
socalled standard deviatioii the square root of the mean of
the squares of the deviations before we can compare the
variabilities of two groups d google we must first reduce
their measures of disper sion to relatives by expressing them
as per centagei of the means for instance a diner
ence of 1000 pounds between the weights of two elephants
is less proportionately than a difference of one ounce between
the weights of two mice failure to recognize this principle
has led some veiy eminent biologists into espousing theories absolutely
at variance with the facts but the statistician does not
limit his study to the consideration of a single vari
able one of his most important task is to analyze
the relationship between ore variable or phenomenon and another he
seeks for instance to find the correlation between pov erty
and crime between the heights of fathers and of their
sons between the ages of hus bands and of their
wives between the price of wheat and the marriage rale
between the size of the wheat kernel and its protein
content between vaccination and immunity from disease we cannot however
directly and definitely measure the effect of one van able
on another because of the many other variables which enter
into the problem but b dealing with a large number
of observa tions we can to a large extent neutralize
these disturbing causes and so make it possible to secure
a very fair determination of the cor relation between the
two variables under con sideration we may for instance seek
to determine the conflation between rainfall and the potato crop
though recognizing that the size of the crop is a
function not merely of the amount of rainfall but also
of the temper ature culture seed and a multitude of
other causes by dealins number of years i these disturbing
elements average value of the correlation sought for the methods

fact no other method will yield a comprehensive quantitative view
of many kinds of phenomena statistics thus becomes the adjunct
of all the sciences and the indispensable agency of gov
ernments in acquiring information concerning production trade distribution of wealth
unem ployment population births marriages deaths divorces diseases accidents and
the many other matters on which the welfare of the
state depends the principal functions of statistics are 1 to
furnish definite bases for comparison of related facts dealing with
enomena of the same or of different periods this function
is well illustrated by the decennial census taken by the
federal gov ernment such census ves a comprehenve view of
the population m all the various dvil divisions of the
country and enables coinpari sons to be made of we
composition of the population in the several divisions with respect
to age sex marital conutton nativity citizen ship etc the
comparison of the data of the latest census with that
of preceding censuses adds greatly to its significance the facts
relative to the increase or decrease of popu lation and
the changes in composition qiat have taken place during the
icyear period are fully as interesting and valuable as the
data contained in the census itself 2 to reveal laws
underlying ilhenomena that could not be determined by individual ob
in dealing with large numbers by the sta tistical method
the constancy and uniformity of natural and social phenomena become

are revealed the mortalily tables used by insurance companies constitute

other wise would be imperfectly known changes in the trend
of rates of birth death marriage divorce etc are shown

by statistics of the relative longevity of total abstainers and
moderate drinkers is a noteworthy example 5 to serve as
a guide for legislative so cial and commercial action statistics
of dependents delinquents and defectives are a prerequisite to the
formulation of adequate statutes relating to these classes the financial
statistics compiled by the govern ment and bv commercial agencies
are indis pensable guides to investors banking and odier business
houses and to the government itself methods in the compilation
of statistics three distinct processes are necessary namely i collection
of data 2 tabulation and chart ing of data 3
analysis and stunmarization of data the collection of data comprises
two separate steps the preparation of blank sched ules and
the filling out of the blanks the mak ing of
the sdiediue is a very important piece of work as
on it depends the success or failure of the statistical
undertaking the principal points to be observed in preparing inqiury
ig v google s84 stat blanks are a the sdiedule
must tie made to fit in with the general tabulation
scheme the whole study must be verjr carefully thought out
and a plan of tabulation made that will clearly show
the answers to the eeneral ques tions it is desired
to ask the schedule should contain the items needed for
tabulation and nothing more it is a serious mistake to
load up an fnuiry blank with superfluous or use less
questions b the schedule must give due regard to precedents
ll is of the highest im portance that the data
obtained by the partic ular study should be comparable with
those obtained in similar previous studies if the study is
one of a senes taken at regular inter vals changes
in standardized schedule items should not be made unless results
had shown the necessity therefor the study may be en
larged by adding new items but the contin uity of
the series should be preserved c the schedules should he
as clear and simple as possible the captions or questions
should be short and leave no doubt as to their
meaning where necessary brief explanations should ac company the items
d except in institutions questions should not relate to the
habits abil iiy or private life of those expected to
answer it is obvious that the one replng will not
place himself in an unfavorable hghl e sched ules should
be printed on sheets of cards of standard sle so
that no diiticulty will be found in obtaining filing cabinets
in which they will ampt fgt if the schedules are
elaborate and are to be tilled out by many different
persons they should be accompanied by a booklet of detailed
instructions coveriiig au the questionabk pointf that might arise if
enumerators are sent out from a central office they should
be given full instructions before beginning the work statistical schedules
are filled out in vari ous ways census blanks are
takian from house to house by paid enumeralora who write
in th information obtained by direct giiesiioniiig they are instructed
to make all necessary exgt punations and to retruire answers
to the ques tions asked as refusal to amwei is
msde a misdemeanor thus little difficulty is experi enced in
security complete data statistics of births and deaths are usually
obtained from schedules iiued out by attending physicians statistics of
iiunates of institutions afc best prepared by having uniform schedules
filled out and sent to a central statistical office elab
orate statistical reports on preparod schedules are obtained by the
interstate commerce com mission and by public service comnussions trom
oompatiies operating public irtilittes in order to make the reports
comparable uniform sys tetns of accountinf have been devised for
com eanies of the various classes the data now eing
collected from such companies arc rme worthy examples of the
efficient use of statis tical methods iahor bureaus secure data
rela five to wages and employment by sending ques tionnaires
to employers and to labor unions and by means of
special agents social and philanthropic organizations make special sta tistical
studies or surveys by the use of ques tionnaires sent
out by mail or by means of investigations made by
field workers the lat ter although of limited scope is
usually more successful when the schedules have been filled out
and returned to the statistical office they miist be examined
for errors and incon sistencies and corrected before tabulation is
undertaken in spite of every precaution some mistake will occur
on the schedules and some desired data will be unascertained
two methods are used in presenting sta tistical data to
the general reader namely tabulation and charting the former is
the pri mary method and is almost univerul the lat
ter is supplemental and of limited use the preparation of
effective statistical tables re quiresood judent and a thorough under
siajidiifg of tfie sificance of the data and of the
questions that are to he answered by the tables although
the numerical table is an end in statistical work the
plan of tabulation must be decided upon before the schedule
is prepared the latter must be so fonnulated that it
will furnish the information needed for the table tdnitations should
be as simple as the data will permit and should
show only significant aggregates the necessity of making the data
comparable with correspondiqg data in previous studies must be home
in mind tabulations may be made either by sorting by
hand and counting or by machines specially devised for such
purpose the number of cards and the kinds of tabulations
to be iqade determine the method to be used in
census work where elaborate stucdes of millions of individuals are
made machines are indispens able uadiine tabulation necessitates the use
of codes whereby the data on the schedule card may
be transferred to the card to be used in the
machine by punching boles at prescribed places the pnnchmg madiines
and cards are made to meet the reqiuremenls of the
sorting and tabulating machines the electric tabulat ing machines will
rnake cross tabulations at the rate of 250 to 400
cards per minute statistical charts or graphs are used to
il lustrate statistical tables they make clear and emphasize the
principal numerical results shown in the tables to be esective
attttutkal charts must meet certain definite requirentents a they must
be selfexylanatory qiarts are useless if they can be understood
only after reading lenguiy e planaiions in the text or
footnotes b they must be simple com plicated charts are
more difficult to understand than statistical tahlcb and diervfore fail
in their purpoie ltc they must have unify ie not
more than one principal theme should be por trayed on
a single chart a large variety of graphic forms are
used in making charts the most comnkid of which are
points bars curves areas and maps the kind of statistical
results to be shown determiaes the form to be used
in aby case to standardize the use of diagrams a
joint committee on standards for graphic presentation representing 17 tiadonal

form another indispensable aid to the statistician in the summariiation
of data an average is a quantity which serves to
char acterize a number of divergent quantities the purpose of
averages is to express by a single item the net
result of a series of items hie dpal forms of
aver used in statistics are the simple arithmetic mean the
weighted arith metical mean the geometric mean the median and
he mode the simple arithmetic mean is most widely used
it is computed by dividing the sum of a series
of numbers by their num ber the weighted arithmetic mean
is found by multiplying the numbers of a series by
co dents or weights of different sizes and dividing the
sum of the products resulting by the sum of all
the coefficients the weighted average is tued in cases where
it is desirable to give greater emphasis to some items
than to others the geometric mean of a series of
ft items is the m root of the product of
the items the use of the geometric mean in sta
tisucs is linuted its principal value has been foimd in
the computation of index tnimbers the median is that vahie
which has the centra position in a series of items
arranged accord mg to size czuber it an odd number
of items is arranged according to size the median is
the middle number of the series if the number of
items constituting the series is even the median lies between
the two central items the median is less dependent upon
extreme values than the arithmetic mean and may often be
taken as tyincal of the series the mode in a
series of items is the vue occurring most frequently and
around which the other items are distributed most densely as
an average it is more typical than either the arithmetic
mean or the median the mode and median however can
be commuted only for a series of quantitative individual observations
such as se ries of wages incomes etc index nnmben
index numbers are used principally to indicate changes in prices
or wages from one period to another the prices of
a certain period are arbitrarily taken ai a standard and
the index number of such pe riod is fixed at
100 the prices in succeeding periods are computed as a
percentage of those of the standard period a general rise
being indicated by an index number above 100 and a
general decline by a number below 100 it is obvious
that index numbers are valuable only for comparative purposes and
that ot themselves they give no indication of the val
ues from which they are derived the wide range of
possibilities in the selection of com modities prices and weights
and in methods of computation has necessitated standardization of procedure
which has been improved from time to time in recent
years dispersion dispersion is a statistical term used to denote
the variation in magnitude of the items constituting a series
it is meas ured by the difference in size of
the extremes or by the general deviation of the items
from the type such measurement may be absolute or relative
for purposes of comparison co effidctits of dispersion are found
by dividing the absolute measure of dispersion by the quantity
representing the typical item the most common measures of dispersion
are known as the average deviation and the stand ard
deviation the former is found by dividing the sum of
the deviations of the several items from the arithmetical mean
without regard to signs by the number of items the
standard deviation is computed by dividing the sura of the
squares of the several deviations from the arithmetical mean by
the number of items and extracting the square root of
the ifuorient in series where the items represent different fre
quencies the standard deviation is fotmd by multiplying the squares
of the several devia tions by the correwnding frequencies and
di viding the sum of the products by the total
frequencies and extracting the square root of the quotient skewneis
skewness in statistics denotes asymmetrical dispersion or that at points
of like deviation above and bolow the mode the frequencies
are unequal skewness is measured in various ways the simplest
measure being in dicated by the difference between the arithmeti
cal mean and the mode the simplest co etficient of
skewness is found by dividing the difeerence thus found by
the average deviation d 6 google from the mode other
coelticientb are found by more compucated mathematical processes cottclation the
determination of the causal relationship between two or more groups
of phenomena known as correlation constitutes able to prove causal
relationships absolutely the are able with other factors to furnim
satisfactory demonstrations of the fact and ex tent of correlation
in many realms of phe qomena correlation between two statistical
series may be shown by diagrams or by com putation
of the coefficient of correlation the former method is used
in statistical work designed for the general reader as the
cor respondence of the two frequency curves on the diagram
is recognized at a glance the second method is used
in cases where a definite measure of correlation is desired
the formula most commonly used in computing co efficients of
correlation is that devised by the biologist karl pearson without
attempting a full mathematical demonstration the method of computation may
be briefly described as follows two series of items of
equal length rqresenting two groups of phenomena are taken the
one group may be designated as group a and the
other as group s the devia tions from the arithmetical
mean of the several items of each group are determined
the devia tions in group a may be designated by
i tf etc and those of group b by ji
jii jii etc the several deviations of the items of
group a are multiplied by the deviations of the correspond
ing items of group b and the products are added
this summation of products is desig nated as xy the
standard deviation of froup a is designated as i and
that of group as oi the number of items is
denoted by then r the coefficient of correlation of groups
a and b is determined by the following formula ssi
r stated in words the sum of the prod ucts
of the deviations as above obtained is divided by the
product of the number of items and the standard deviations
of the two groups modifications of the method are used
in deal ing with various kinds of phenomena and elab
orate formuke have been devised to determine the coefiicient of
correlation of three or more groups of phenomena through the
work of pearson bowlcy yule persons and others rapid development
has taken place in mathe matical statistics during recent years
much of the work in this field however is of
a theoretical nature and has limited application in general statistics
hiitory the beginning of statistics are found in very early
times the ancient egyp tians compiled data concemini population and
wealth preparatory to the buildjng of the pyra mids about
3050 bc there are accounts of statistical works in china
as early as 2300 bc two censuses of the israelites
are recorded in the book of numbers a census was
taken in greece for the purpose of levying taxes in
594 bc athens took a census of population in 309
bc the romans excelled every other nation of antiquity in
makinj definite measure ments besides making quinquennial enumcra tions of
the population they repartd surveys of ihc entire countrj including
parts of the provinces they alio kept records of urths
and deaths it was many centuries after the fall of
the roman empire before another com prehensive system of governmental
statistics was established very few statistical records of value were
made during the middle ages but occasional investigations were ordered
tiy sovereigns pepin the short in 758 and charle magne
in 762 ordered the detailed description of church lands the
registries of lands in france taken al these and succeeding
periods known as polyptiques included an enumera tion of the
rural population the best known census of this period is
the domesday book prepared by order of wuiam the conqueror
m 1088 ad the purpose of this was to ac
juaint the sovereign with the extent of his new ominion
and the tenure of the various parcels of land sebastian
muenster a heidelberg professor antidpaled the field of comparative statistics
hy preparing a systematic treatise on the organization wealth armies
commerce laws etc of ancient countries francesco sansovino published a
similar work in 1562 and giovanni botero another in 1589
pierre davity seigneur de montmarin compiled a much more comprehensive
and accurate treatise in the same field in 1614 the
reaiatntion of deaths was begun in london in 1532 and
was followed by that of baptisms by parish clergy men
in 1629 the distinction of sex was made in the
record in 1661 a noteworthy statistical advance was made by
tlie publication hy capt john graurt of his observations on
the lon don bills of mortality he was the first
to point out the regidanty of social phenometu and the
excess of male births over female caspar neumann of breslau
in 1691 compiled data relative to 5869 deaths from the

supposed fateful significance of the years seven and nine was

noteworthy c6n tribution of this period was the mathematical demimslration

of basel the ird tialistik was gottfried phy at the
university of goltingen tlie word comes from the italian suitiita
which denoted statesman achenwall in his book discussed matters that
he believed of interest to the state such as population
resources constitu tions etc the name statistics was introduced into
england by dr zimmerman about 1787 and was popularized by
sir john sinclair in his statisiica account of scotland 1791
99 writings more of the nature of modem statistics are
found in sir william petns political aritbmetick i691 and siissmilchs

century and the beginning of the 19th marked the revival
of census taking the united states look its first decennial
census of population in 1790 england and france began periodic
census taking in 1801 the former country has continued the
practice at 10year intervals but the latter after tabing a

1806 took no funher eniuner dons of population until 1836
from that year to 1901 four general censuses were taken
since 1901 a census of population has been taken in
france evciy live vears belgium took its first census in
129 the analysis of this census by suetelet contains noteworthy
observations on e influence of age sex occupation economic condition
and season upon mortality upon the organtiation of the belgium
statistical central commission in 1841 quetelet became its presi dent
and continued to hold the office until his death in
1874 his work not onlyplaced the statis tics of his
native country on a high plane but did much to
raise the standards of statistical work throughout the world the
progress of statistics was accelerated by the founding of the
sod de statistique de paris in 1803 the royal statistical
society of london in 1834 and the american statistical association
in 1839 elach of these societies holds meetings griodically and
publishes the papers presented its members the first meeting of
the international statistical congress was held in brussels in 1853
after holding eight addi tional meetings it was succeeded by
the inter national statistical institute in 1885 these so cieties
have done much to promote uniformity in itatiaticat classifications schedules
and tables and otherwise to advance the science since 1890
there has been wonderful expansion in the field of statistics
practically every civilized country now takes periodic entmieracions of its
population keeps continuous records of births deaths marriages and divorces
and pre pares elaborate statistics relative to production lorei and
domestic commerce finance public utilities labor sericulture education immigra tion
etc the united states made a great advance in 1902
by making the census bureau a permanent office previous to
that time the bureau was organized anew every 10 years
for the purpose of taking the general census and was
discontinued when the work was com pleted while national statistics
has been ex panding there has been an equally great
exten sion ol statistical work in states and cities massachusetts
took the lead in state statistics by establishing a permanent
bureau of statistics and labor in 1869 a similar bureau
was estab lished by pennsylvania in 1872 by connecticut in
1873 and by ohio in 1877 subsequently several other states
took like actioil witb the enlargement of state activities durinj
the past 30 years the need of adequate statistics has
been met in part at least by creating bureaus sties
within state departments these i publish annual statistics relating to
nuances taxation banking insurance infra state commerce labor conditions public
utili ties education dependents delinquents defect ives deaths births disease
accidents etc scarcely less important are the valuable statis tics
prepared by the principal cities of the country these statistics
deal with the func tions of the city and the
problems that the city is required to solve such as
education housing tranqtortation docks pavements water supply electricity gas crime
fires accidents and dis eases noteworthy contributions to statistics are
being made by various ornizations such as insurance companies banking
houses na tional sociological and philanthropic soieties etc the insurance
companies especially have done remarkable work in studying health con

w my father london 1913 steam steam is water in
a gaseous state it liquefies at a temperature of 100
c or 212 f under a pressure of one atmosphere
at the sealevel namely 147 pounds per square inch high
pressure and low pressure steam once meant steam used at
pressures above or helow this point an engine which exhausted
its steam into the open air that is at ordi
nary atmosphere pressure was known as a hignpressure engine an
engine which ex hausted into a condenser where a partial
vacuum was maintained was called a low pres sure engine
but these terms have lost their former significance absolute steam
pressure is the total pressure computed from the zero of
an absolute vacuum as distinguished from relative pressure at sealevel
ordinaiy steam gauges indicate pressure above that of the at
mosphere to this must be added the pressure of the
atmosphere in order to obtain the abso lute steam pressure
the temperature of steam is sometimes expressed in degrees absolute
meaning the number of degrees above abso lute zero which
is on the fahrenheit scale affy that is 460 below
the zero mark on a fahre t thgt saturated steam
is steam at its greatest dens ity and pressure at
the particular temperature existing that is any increase in pressure
or any lowering of temperature would cause con densationa part
of the steam would return to the condition of water
if saturated steam holds in suspension less than 3 per
cent of unvaporized water it is known as dry steam
if 3 per cent or more of water is present
it is termed wet steam dry steam as it issues
from a jet into the air is colorless wet steam
issues as a white cloud the presence of free water
in steam is highly objeclionable it rep resents a loss
of heat without production of useful work and to that
extent reduces the efficiency of the boiler and increases the
cost of the steam actually used further it adds to
the amount of water of condensation to he jt turbines
erodes the blades almost as if they had been subjected
to a sandblast when a space is saturated with steam
the pressure exerted is known as saturation pres sure if
the content of a space which is satu rated with
steam be reduced some of the steam is condensed to
a liauid state but the pressure remains the same if
the volume of the sace be increased provided that it
contains sulscient liquid more water evaporates and the pressure exerted
by the water vapor soon attains the same value as
before the change of volume if the temperature of a
space containing water and its saturated vapor be raised the
satura tion pressure of the vapor is increased if on
the other hand the temperature falls some of the vapor
is condensed and the saturation pres superbeated steam is saturated
steam heated until it resembles a perfect gas the nr
heating of steam is accomplied by drying practice the drying
cannot be done while the steam is in contact with
the water in the boiler for any increase of heat
applied to the latter goes to forming more saturated steam
the temuerature remaining relatively the same that is according to
the pressure white saturated steam begins to con dense at
once upon loss of heat superheated steam retains its gaseous
form until it has lost all its heat above 212
this quality of steam makes it of great value in
engines the expansion in the cylmder being wholly gaseous and
without leaving any water of condensatiou the source of the
largest loss of efficiency in engines the superheating of steam
is com monly accomplished bv passing it through a grid
of pipes open to the fire in ordinary en gine
practice tile effect of superheated steam is secured by wiredrawing
it the term sig nifying the causing it to pass
throu a reb tively vciy small opeiung this is done
on an engine by partly closing the throttle valve the
temperature remaining the same the small fall in pressure results
in superheating the steam allowed to pass through tne valve
superheated steam has a lower thermal conductivity than saturated steam
and this 3uality reduces the leakage of heat to the
nlin et walls b 12 per cent the radiation from
s carrying superheated steam is less also fuel expense of
superheating steam is not large the amount of fuel required
to raise steam to 100 of superheat that is to
312 being an increase of only 569 per cent over
that required to produce the satu rated steam of 212
the limit to which superheat may be added to wafer
confined in a boiler is about 600 equivalent to a
pressure of 1574 pounds per square inck above this iwint
the proper lubrication of the cylinders of reciprocating engines and
the maintenance of packings of valves and condens ing apparatus
in noritial condition is impracd eable the practical limit of
safe pressure in modern boilers is 200 pounds per square
inch equivalent to a temperature of about 380 or 168
of superheat in the united states the range of superheat
practice does not exceed 500 r dgt google degrees and
there are few instances in which it exceeds 450 in
europe however few punts are installed without superheaters and the
temperatures range from 600 for ordinary to 850 as the
lop limit for these very high pressures specially built boilers
are required and the extra cost of such wotic osfsets
the advantages which may be gained live steam is steam
which has performed no work or rather which is available
for the performance of work steam which has performed work
is called exhaust steam when a pound of water at
212 is turned into steam at 212 9657 heat units
are ab sorbed in the change of form this energy
reappears when the steam returns to the form of water
herein lies the vast economic profit in the utilization of
exhaust steam in the heating of feed water for the
boiler warming the shop etc every pound of exhaust steam
hi ml the change from a liquid to a gaseous
state takes place beneath the surface the steam ris ing
to the surface and escaping with ebumition the boiling point
that is the temperature at which steam is formed depends
on the pres sure under which it is generaled if
the water is confined to a limited space as in
a boiler if the pressure above it is relieved with
an airpump the boiling point will be lowered if pressure
is brought to bear on the water in the boiler
the boiling point is raised this is in effect what
happens in ordinary boiler practice the pressure is increased by
making more steam than there is room for in the
boiler above the water the steam being comnressible accumu lates
in a slate of compression and the boiler pressure rises
as shown by the sieamgauge the following table gives the
relations between pressure volume and tola heat of steam for
temperatures between 32 f and 428 f dur ing the
first stage of heating all the heat sen sibly goes
into increasing the internal energy of the fluid this is
represented in the last column of the table during the
second stage the heat taken in is known as latent
heat of steam the total heat of both stages is
repre sented by the numbers in the fourth column of

water has the greatest specific heat of any known substance
except hydrogen by this we mean that more heat enters

thermal units per pound of water fahrenheit scale it is
easily condensed giving out this energy these facts together with
its universal and abundant presence in large quantities have ren
dered steam up lo this time a favorite means for
the generation of mechanical power the process of changing steam
into mechanical power may be briefly outlined as follows if
we start with water at 32 f and apply heat
the temperature of ihc water will rise one degree tor
each thermal unil but expansion does not begin until 38
to 40 of tem perature are reached when i9ii units
of heat have been absorbed the temperature of the water
will be found to be 212 f and its expansive
force into a vacuum equal to 147 pounds to the
square inch or that of the atmos phere at sealevel
at this point the water is incapable of becoming any
hotter under thai pressure the heat added after that point
is reached is used in converting the water into steam
and 9657 thermal units are required for each pound of
water thus converted this so called latent beat is stored
energy to be given back again in mechanical work and
heat as the steam is condensed if we enclose both
water and steam in a boiler of suitable con struction
and continue heating part of the water will lie vaporized
but being prevented ly the constied space from expanding it
crowds the steam already enclosed into a smaller vol ume
and the pressure upon the surface of the water is
increased so that the heal now added increases temperature again
when we have added 11s86 total thermal units including temperature

329 f see table i columns i 2 and 4
we have now to consider how this energy is transformed
when the steam in the cylin der of an engine
performs work by pushing the piston against a resistance that
work robs the steam of a portion of its heat
hence the steam is oondensed theoretically it requires two and
a half pounds of steam saturated to supply one horse
power of work each hour but practically from 5 to
25 times that amount is required to pass through an
engine in order to secure this result this is due
to the loss of the energy of the steam in
giving up its heat to the walls of the cylinder
and to the immense portion of the steam which acts
only as backing in the best quadruple engines of today
less than onefifth of the energy of the steam is
con vened into actual work and in the best non
condensing engines only onetenth the waste is enormous but the
abundance of the supply in part compensates for it according
to the 1914 census of manufac tures the number of
steam engines and steam turbines employed in manufacturing in the
united states was 137176 and the total horse power developed
was 15681688 or 695 per cent of all forms of
power in the countty a large amount of steam is
used in addition to this for heating purposes its value
in this respect is due to its being able to
carry more heat for a given weight than any other
substance and when it has given up its heat to
drop out of the way by condensation and make way
for a fresh supply steam is also used extensively in
extracting processes it is often injected directly into a liquid
bub bling through it and carrying over certain con stituents
to be released in the condensing chamber in other cases
especially those of liquids boiling at a lower temperature than
water coils of steam pipes supply the mild de eee

not until the second marquis of wor cester edward somerset
constructed a steam fountain 1650 and employed it in raising
water from ihe moat to ihc top of he tower
of raglan castle and later erected another for similar purposes
at vauxhall that the story of the evolution of the
steamengine really begins meantime the scientific men of the later
cen turies were acquiring some exact knowledge of the nature
rof steam earlier confounded with other gases aiid some familiarity
with its latent powers steam power first became an acknowledged
industrial agent and useful as a prime mover when savery
at the beginning of the 18th century 1698 made worcesters
steamfoun tain practically applicable to the drainage of mines and
the elevation of water for water supply generally this apparatus
which could not be properly called an enjjine consisted of
a pair of cylindrical or ellipsoidal forcing ves google steamengine
sis which were alternately filled with water by the production
of a vacuum within the vessel and emptied by the
introduction of high pressure steam from an adjacent boiler the
one being emptied while the other was filling and viceversa
this apparatus introduced by sav ery improved and further made
kivown by desaguliers and by smcalon was known and in
use before he year 1775 throughout the world where mining
at considerable depths and in sresence of water was carried
on the steam onntain is still in use and is
known as the pulsometer newcomens steamengine the first steam engine
properly so termed the first which con sisted of a
train of mechanism as distinguished from the hero steam fountain
which was a piece of apparalus without moving parts was
patented in 1705 it consisted of a sieamcvlin der and
piston actuating a beam above from the opposite end of
which was pendant the ptimprod operating the pumps in the
shaft of the mine it was always used as a
steam pump ing engine thomas newcomen and his part ner
john calley are thus to be credited with the invention
and introduction of the modern steamengine with ail its essential
elements as a pumping engine it was the improvement of
this engine by the addition of various valuable devices which
gave james watt his fame and fortune this earliest type
was a condensing cn gnie in which condensation was effected
by means of a jet of water directed into the
steam cylinder when the pressure on the under side o
the piston was io be removed the upper side was
open to the air there being no upper cyhnderhead the
engine was thus operated by the atmospheric pressure steam being
held at about atmospheric pressure and only em loyed to
secure a vacuum below ihc piston he pressure of the
atmosphere depressing the piston the pumprod on the opposite end
of the beam was raised and the pump filled with
the fall of the pumprod the water was forced out
of he pump and rdised lo the upper level the
weight on the outer end of the beam always overbalanced
the weight oi the piston and attachments sufbciently to do
the lequired work this type of engine remained in use
for a century and old engines of new comens time
are still in existence the type became known later as
the cornish engine walts impravemeuls having been meantime added after
newcomens death the machine was improved in details by desaguliers
and by smeaton who considerably increased its econ omy by
attaching wood to the piston and cylinderhead lo prevent what
has been called cylinder condensation by action of alter nately
heated and cooled metal in contact with the steam this
was probably the first reo ognition in construction of this
important phe the valves of this engine were at first
worked by hand but a boy humphrey potter is credited
with having devised an automatic system which later in 1718
carefully designed and constructed in a workmanlike manner by henry
beighton a wellknown engineer of that period became the first
automatic valvemotion james watt introducing the needed improve nients in
the newcomen engine finally produced the modern types of reciprocating
steam engine his iitst great improvement was the separate condenser
which permitted condensa tion to be effected without the iutroductiot
of water into the working cylinder and thus re duced
vcr greatly the waste of steam by initial condensation watt
first enunciated the prin ciple ke the cylinder if possible
as hot as the steam that enters it the first
step wm this of removing the primary cause of refriger
ation the next was to surround the cylinder with a
chamber containing steam at boiler pres sure thus introducing his
second great invcn lion the steamjacket he next covered the
upper end of the cyhnder excluding the cold air and
supplying the place of the atmosphere and its pressure on
the upper side of the piston by steam from the
boiler completing his scheme of keeping the cylinder as far
as was practi cable as hot as the entering steam
the doubleacting engine constituted the next and an easy step
with steam admitmd at both ends of the cylinder it
was itemedlt ately evident that each might be utilized alter
nately in the performance of work and watt soon adjusted
his valvegear and connections in such manner as lo permit
this alternation and produce a push and a pull on
the pistonrod this compelled a rigid connection between the piston
and overhead beam on the one end and between the
outer end of the beam and its work now become
that of rotating a shaft with crank and flywheel thus
one improvement led lo another and watts steamengine ultimately be
came capable of supplying power to every im aginable kind
of machine or work the single acting engine was for
many years after watts death used in raising water and
the double acting engine continues to turn the shaft of
mill locomotive steamip and factory watt invenled and introduced many
acces sory inventions and devices as the attachment of the
governor already a wellknown ap paratus the steamengine indicator the

from that of new comen these improvements raised the duty
of the pumpine engine in the course of 25 years
from about 7000000 footpounds to 30000000 and in the latest
forms of cornish engines about 1850 to twice the last
figure or more reducing cost of steampower enormously and at
the same time adapting the steamengine to every requirement in

and other able mechanics and in ventors were seeking to
construct locomotives and complete success was achieved by george steienson
in engines built from 1814 to 1833 the steamboat had
been suggested by numerous writers and engineers and after many
attempts was made a practical success by john fitch in
the united states about 1785 hy john stevens in 180409
and commercially by fulton 180715 in great britain after matw

of the first transatlantic steamship voyages those of the cirius
and the great western all dviliied countries were employing the
steam boat see steam vessels meanwhile the elements of economy
became recognized and steampressures rose from the two to seven
pounds above the atmosphere of watts time to 25 or
30 about i8s0 and to 100 and upward to occasionally
200 at the end of the 19th century the ratio
of expansion of the steam increasmg in similar ratio the
speeds of enginepiston also gradually increased from about 100 feet
per minute at the binning to w and often to
1000 at its end the weights of engine and sizes
for the usual powers mean time fell from 1000 pounds
or more per horse power developed at the time of
watt 500 about 1850 and to 250 in 1900 where
weights were oomparalively unimportant and in special cases where weight
and volume required to be reduced to the smallest possible
figures as for torpedo boats to a fourth or a
fifth the lastnamed quantity the compotmd he triple and the
quadruple expansion engine have largely displaced the sim ele engine
of watt the first of these types aving been introduced
in watts time by horn blower woolf and falk and
the second by kirk about 1874 while the last mentioned
became s land 3rd widi the rise of steampressures to
about is atmospheres about 1890 these com pkcations are mainly
the outcome of the en deavor to follow watt in
repressing the waste by cylinder condensation reducing the propor tion
of heatabsorbing surface and the temper aturehead producing flow of
heat into the metal of the cjdinder incidentally the multiple
cylinder engine gives a steadier rotation of the crankshaft and
a smoother action of the steam than the simple engine
and also reduces weight by lessening die maximum load upon
the work ing parts the range of pressure in each
tyhnder being reduced with this reduction of tempera turerange this
steady progression from the days of watt to the present
fioallv culminated in a re trogression to the simple form
of the hero en gine the steamturbine in which ail
the compli cation of the wattnewcomen engine is done away
with and but one moving pan performs every essential office
apart from c and yet secures in its best const
economical results of the whole changes distinguishing the 19th century
with the added n of reduced volume weight and cost
both initial and operative the turbine promises thus to provide
power with maximum ultimate result in financial dficiency mean time
the gasengine after a similar period of development is now
rivaling the reciprocating steamengine in many of its fields the
best steamengines of both the standard types and the gasengine
are now capable of deriving large powers from substandally the
same quantity of enegjy potential in fuel the strvclure of
the steamengine differs in detail according to place and purpose
the familiar forms may be thus classed a primary classification
as condensing and noncondesing distinguishes engines by their utilization or
non utilization of the vacuum in the former class condensation
may be effected by sur face or by jetcondensation this
distinction indicating a subordinate method of identi fication of a

these engines are usually the same in all the forms
in which the individual piece is found a rod or

invention and the progress ob served has been mainly one
of refinement and adaptation frederick sickels introduced a successful form
of drop cutos corliss greene and others invented improved valve

and others successfully established the highspeed enne as a motor
where rapid rotation of the prime mover facili tated transmission
of power as with electric generators and in rolling mills

by george stephenson and loday in its many forms and
uses the enne ia its essential details and distinsuishing feat
ures is that of stephenson refined and adapted to high
and to low speeds to heavy and to light loads
a very noticeable feature of the later engines is the
forward truck or bogie de vised by john b lervis
which bv permitting the forward wheels lo swivel and the
engine to rock upon the truck aecommodates the locomo tive
to sharp curves and irregular track in marine construction a
similar adaptation of the form and proportions of the engine
to the speda purpose in view gives rise to the
types employed with sidewheel and screw high powers and low
to the essential requirements ui lightness and small bulk of
torpedoboat practice and the needs of transatlantic naviga tion and
of that of the rivers of the united states the
substitution of surface condensa tion for condensation by the jet
has been com pelled in seagoing shis by the use
of hif pressure steam ana the impracticability of using seawater
in the boilers the latter forms of engine are thus
refinements and adapiadons of the earlier meantime in all directions
the steamengine has come to be utilized in die production
of very large powers and its construction in ver large
units is found to be very frequently eco nomically desirable
siadonary engines for mills and especially for large powerstations supplying
the ener applied in electric lighting or power distribution for
electric railways are built in sizes ranging from a few
hundred horse power up to 13000 horse lower and sometimes
grouped into systems rating as hi as 100000 uarine engines
are also constructed in these large sizes ana powers and
as high as 70000 horse power may be used for
the latest and largest transatlantic steamers as in the uautelatiio
the locomotive in the time of stephenson weighing in the
case of his first successful machines four to six tons
is now built of nearly 120 tons weight and capable
of hauling loads of 30000 tons at good speeds on
level rails the steam pumping engine of the tune of
newcomen and wall had a capacity of a few hundred
thousand gallons per day it is now furnished in sizes
uf to 75000000 gal lons per day for reciprocating engines
and up to 320000000 for rotary engines while its duty
has risen from the comparatively insignificant rres of the times
of the inventors to 150000 and even 180000000 footpounds per
hun dred pounds of fuel the si earn turbine for
all these uses may now be obtained in as large
powers as the reciprocating engine and with subsiantially the same
guaranteed duty its relatively high speed of rotation ranging from
600 to 3000 in die largest sizesj lo 30000 in
the small and its smooth rotation make its use distinctively
advantageous in electric serv ices and its small weight and

of the work of elevation of the weight affected to

with the gases do not prevent the free movement of
molecules in any direction and to any extent nor do
they fix the vohime and density of the substance liquids
are fluids in which the action of in terna molecular
forces gives stability of vol ume but not of form
and the energies internal and external are thus limited to
comparatively small ranges and to comparativety small values while range
and values are often enormously great when the liquid becomes
vaporous not withstanding rapid diminution of molecular at tractions solids
have stability both of volume and of form the ranges
of internal forces and of ener gies are still more
restricted than with liquids and their extent of action and
their values are still less than in liquids bv accession

liquids become vapors and vapors when super heated become gases
it is to be noted that whenever a substance of

range of volume whatever its temperature or the pressure precisely
the same amount of in ternal ener is lost and

effort of the internal forces series of changes of pressure
volume and tem perature resulting in the final return of
die sub stance to its initial physical state in this

of in ternal ener is zero this process is iuustrated
in heatengines in which the working substance is coniined within
the working chamber and therein passes through repeated cycles with
repetition of the kinematic cycle of the machine itself obvionsly
also where a working fluid traverses a cycle the preseoce
or the absence of the qiianlity of internal energy become
a mat ter of no importance when we seek only
ta de terniine the quanlil of permanent thermo dynamic transformation
the malude and enect of internal forces and energies have
no influence upon the efficiency of i rans formation but
they have importance as affecting the rela tions of iressure
volume and temperature and ihe magnitude of the wotldns cylinder
and of the heatengine itself in the highest boiler pressures
now usual these forces are about 10 times the gauge
pressure at atmospheric ex ternal pressure they amount to 13
atmospheres these pressures cannot be measured by any gauge but
may be readil computed with pre cision from easily ascertainable
data they are greene engine isjs perfectly well known as
are the specific volumes of the fluid which are very
difiicuu but not impossible of direct measurement the gasengine has
the advantage in com parison with the steamengine in its
higher available temperature rane and consequent higher thermodynamic efficiency the
exact treatment of the thermodynamics of the steamgtengine requires the
use of the hier mathematics but the general principles have
been pven and the following will pemut its applications to

only ibcrmal and dynamic eneres are s resent and operative
lis action is to trans arm as large a proportion
as possible of the heat supplied it into mechanical power
and work each pound of steam from the boiler usually
brings over the eatiivalent of about 04 botsepowerhour and each
horsepowerhour is the ideal equivalent of the heatcontent of about
2j pounds a kilogram nearly of boiler steam of this
heat a part which is precisely measured by the area
of the indicator diagram is con verted into useful work
and an efficiency a attained measured by the ratio of
the useful to the suppued energy in common units thus
where 23 pounds of steam per hour are de manded

is iq per cent the heat supplied being that furnished
from the fuel and measured 1 the difference between the

that of the steam in the boiler the ninetenths which
fails of miiiiation is composed of a variety of wastes
including the thermodynamic that portion of the heat reach ing
the steamcylinder and actually acting upon the niston which is
not converted into indicated work the waste by conduction and
radiation ex ternally and the waste by the transfer of
heat between the metal of the cylinder and the work
ing fluid these quantities in a ood example may be
taken as follows the fricuon wastes of the machine itself
being included avultgt1e betniett trom this corresponds for the ideal

of the steamengine is usually considored to be covered by
an allow ukc of about one b t u per

exposed metal having a rough sur face it may attain
two to three times these fid ures the exterior of
the cylinder is commonly lagged and die heads if not
thus covered are polished thus minimiang tlie waste the total
waste on even smalt engines has been fonnd capable of
being reduced to less than 35 per cent total inclusive
of engine and boiler by the use of good nonconducting
corerings this loss is often quite unimportant on large ennes
the internal wastes are produced by beat exchanges betwcien metal
and steam at indue tion and eduction the steam ving
heat to the metal at its entrance into the cylinder
and rob bing the metal at exhaust thus transferring heal
often in large quantities from the steam 10 the exhaust
side very much as leakage car ries the steam itself
with its cbarrc of heat the effect on efficiency is
precisely that of leafc age in this action the cylinderheads
and the sides of the piston being exposed to the
widest rane of temperature and for the longest periods are
most fruitful of waste the cylin der proper and especially
its middle portion wastes least the total loss is a
function oi the temperature rarwe the time of exposure to
transfer and the quality of steam and of the ratio
of expansion which nteaaures rudely the juaatily of steam per
unit weight of metal it any one engine it may
be stated as a rough approximation that the condensation is
a con stant quantity at all expansions it may be
treated as either a constant leakage or as doygoogic stbambnoins

common value of this leakage may be laken in pounds
as not far from 002 b t u per square
foot of surface exposed at cutoff per minute per fahrenheit
degree of temperaturerange as a fraction of the steam supplied
it is appro jcimatefy propor tional in any given engine
lo the square root of the ratio of expansion with
various types of engine it ranges from 25 or 30
per cent with imple cdkines of moderate size to 10
per cent in niuhiplecylinder engines of modem con troction as
a minimum in steam pumps and very small engines it
may amotmt to more than the whole amount of steam
taken in for ther modynamic action these machines demandink 100
and even sometimes 150 or more pounds of steam per
horse power hour waste threefourths or more by leakage of
heat the rccord breaking engines of large site and superior
design demand as little as 10 to 12 pounds ap
proximating 200 b t v per horse power hour the
velocity of heatexchange in this man ner is many times
greater than in transfers across the boiler heating surfaces it
is the most rapid known form of condensation of steam
and is often 10 times as rapid as the pro
duction of steam in the boiler suppwine it the conditions
of maximum efficiency are mainly two the reduction to the
practicable minimum of the thermodynamic waste by in creasing in
all possible ways the area of the in dicator diaam
per unit of steam supplied and iy minimiring the wastes
of heat between boijer and engicetiiston the first includes the
in crease of the initial pressure with decrease of backpressure
and adjustment qf the ratio of expansion of the steam
to the range thus se cured the second involves reduction
of conduce tion and radiation by use of suitable noncon
ducting coverings of heated surfaces protectimi from cooling influences and
reducing cylinder condensatiad by drying and superheating die steam by
increasing the speed of enne and by miniahing the heat
exchanges between metal and steam by fine finish of surfaces
and where practicable by interposition of nonconducting material as was
done by smeaton and at tempted by later inventors mechanical
efficiency the ratio of work transmitted from the piston to
the point of useful apication ranges from 95 per cent
in direct acting engines as a maximum lo 85 per
cent with the older noncondensing engines it is made a
maximum and friction reduced to a minimum by careful design
and especiall by gecurinft constant complete and free lubrication usually
in the best cases by a circulatory flow of oil
flooding the bearings and returned by pumps to the source
through a filler to be again distributed to the rubbing
surfaces of the engine the lost work is the less
as the pres sures arc higher within limits determined by
the nature of the materials as the lubricant is bet
ter adapted to its intended purpose and as the flow
is more liberal where reaching the rub bing parts the
highest values of the roefli cient of friction are often
10 and sometimes 20 times the lowest and the careful
attention of the engineer to this detail is always well
com considerations and the principle involved in de termining the
limit may be thus expressed that engine is most perfectly
adapted to its place and purpose of which the type
is such that no practicable substitution will permit the supply
of the demanded power at lower total operative costs including
interest on first cost a sinking fund to provide for
replacement at die end of its period of use and
annual operating expense and that size of endue is on
the whole best variation from vyhicn in the direc tion
of either increased or lessened slie will in crease that
total expense of operation in the latter case the gain
by reduction of size will be more than compensated by
the loss due to its reduced efficiency the best engine
is that which will give largest returns on the capital
invested adding most effectively during its life to the dividends
obtainable from the plant of which it forms a part
the adjustment of the ratio of expansion of the steam
to the requirements of maximum effi ciency is the vital
problem of the designing en gineer and the purchaser of
the engine in the ideal case of the purely thermodynamic
ma chine this ratio is that of the initial to
the back pressure very nearly and the terminal pressure on
the expansionline should coincide with the backpressure for maximum economy
of fuel this expansion ratio should be reduced in proportion
closely to the loss if heatwastes between boiler and uston
for maximum effi ciency from the financial point of view
a still further reduction is required in proportion lo the
relation of the operating costs apart from those of steammakin
to those of engineopera tion proper thus m the thermodynamic
case with initial and final pressures respectively 10 atmospheres and
one the ratio is reduced often from about 10 to
seven or eight by initial con densation and minor wastes
and to six by ad justment to that value departure
from which in either direction would increase total costs of
the horsepowerbour with condensing engines the ideal ratio might be
40 or 50 while the ratio for maxi mum duty
would be not above 20 and the best ratio from
the point of view of the treas urer mihtbe not
above 12 or 15 the ac curacy with which the
designing and e ing engineer determines the adjustr maximum financial
efficiency is a measure of his ability and skill and
a gauge of his success in solving his problem with
each standard con sfaclorily d oon of this problem the
ease of the steamturbine exhibits here one of its essentia
peculiarities the ratio of expansion is fixed by the conditions
of its de sign construction and operation and is neces
sarily the ratio of initial to backpressure if properly constructed
the maximum efficiency of the turbine is obtained at its
maximum power and it possesses the same inherent inflexibility as
the hydraulic turbine if of other than the partial class
in which latter case power is adjusted to load by

a total euesdal pmrti of the steunsncine the steamengine consists
necessarily of two parts the engine properin which the expan
sive force of steam is expended and the gen erator
or boiler in which the energy denvcd from 3 burning
fuel is transferred to water the steam generator or boiler
is fully dealt with in the article boiler the eiwine
proper is made up of several parts of wfaidi the
chief is a cylinder in which a piston is moved
by the expansive force of the steam generated in the
boiler the boiler is connected to the cylinder by means
of the steam pipe in which is a stop valve
also the throttle valve or re lator for adjusting the
opening for the admis sion of steam to the cylinder
which in some engines is regulated by hand and in
others by a governor the steam pipe contains some times
also the cutofi valve or expansion valve for cuttin off
the admission of the steam to the cylinder at any
required period of each stroke of the piston leaving the
remainder of the stroke to b performed by the expansion
of the steam already admitted to the cylinder the cylinder
the heart of the steam engine may be single or
double acting in a singleacting engine the piston is forced
in one direction t the pressure of the steam and
made to return in the opposite direction when the steam
is discharged by the action of a weteht or counter
poise in a doubleacting cylinder the piston is forced in
either direction by the pressure of the steam which is
admitted nd disdiarged passages called nozdes which are opened and
closed by induction and eduction valves some times the induction
and eduction valves are combined in one valve called a
slide valve the valves are contained in the valve chesl
in noncondensing engines conventionally the pipe is placed in the
centre of the chimney so that the successive blasts of
steam discharged from it augment the draut of air through
the furnace and cause the combustion of the fuel to
be more or jess rapid according as the engine is
performing more or less work the cylinder cover has tn
it a stuffing box for the passage of the piston
rod in large engines there are sometimes more than one
piston rod and tnifing box and sometimes a tubular piston
rod called a trunk the cylinder cover is also provided
with a grease cup to facilitate the ibrication of the
cylinder and piston rod in many large engines there is
a spring safety valve called an escape valve at eadi
end of the blinder the chief use of whidi is
to disdiarge water which may condense in the cylinder or
be carried over in the liquid state from the boiler
by what is called priming to prevent condensation in the
cylinder it is sometimes enclosed in a casing called a
jacket the in termediate space being filled with hot steam
from the boiler or hot air from a flue out
side the jacke to prevent loss of heat ex ternally
there is a covering of felt and wood or other
insulation double cylinder engine have two clinders the steam being
admitted from the boiler into the first cylinder and then
filling the second by expansion from the firtl the ordinary
condenser is a steam and air tigt vessel of any
convenient shape in which the steam dischuged from the cylinder
ii liquefied by a constant shower igtf cold water from
the roseheaded injection valve in land engines the injection water
comes from a tank called the cold well surrounding the
condenser and supplied by the cold water pump in marine
engines it comes directly from the sea in the surface
condenser the steam is liquefied by being passed through tubes
or other narrow passages surrounded by currents of cold water
or cold air the coi denser is provided with blowthrough
valvel communicating with the cylinder usually shut but capie of
igteing occasionally opened ana with a snifting valve opening outwards
to file atmosphere through these valves steam can be blown
to expel air from the cylinder and con denser before
the engine is set to work the condenser has also
a vacuum gauge to show how much the pressure in
it alls below that of the atmosphere the water the
small por tion of steam which remains uncondensed and the
air which may be mixed with it are sucked from
the condenser by the air pump and dis charged into
the hot well a tank from whidi the feed pump
draws the supply of water from the boiler tlie surplus
water of the hot well in land engines is discharged
into a tank there to cool and form a store
for the cold well in marine engines it is ejected
into the sea in all except certain peculiar classes of
engines there is a parallel motion for guiding the head
of the piston rod to mafvc in a straigjit line
consisting either simply of strairiit cheeks or guides or of
a combination of levers and linkworb invented by watt and
more or less modified by others the special classes of
engines above referred to are first trunk engines where the
stuffing box is the guide secondly oscillating engines in which
the head of the piston rod is directly connected with
die crank and the cylinder oscillates m truagt d google

highways in 1824 david gordon patented an arrangement for fitting
to a steamengine a set of jointed legs in imitation

year burstall and hill made a steamcarriage in which the

by robinson and by watt in 17s9 and by cugnot
10 years later but it was not until the third
decade of the 19ih century that the steamengine had been
sufficitntl developed to tempt inventors to try to adapt it
to road service in 1827 gurncy built a steam carriage
which worked for about two years in and around iondon

a windlass and in one of the mic wars the
romans transferred an army to sicily upon vessels moved by
wheels that were operated by oxen prince rupert after retiring
from his military lifc had a boat con structed on
the thames river prior to 1680 tiiat was propdied t
paddle wheels which were driven by horse power it is
thus clear that some form of paddle wheel for propulsion
was made use of long before the steamengine was in
service the uarquis of worcester had experimented with the steamengine
from about 1635 he died in 1667 leaving a manu
script in which he says by this i can make
a vessel of as great burthen as the river can
bear to o against the stream and this engine is
applicable to any vessel or boat what soever without therefore
being made on pur pose it roweth it draweth it
driveth to lass london bridge against the stream at early
steamboats the experiment nar rated many years ago of blasco
de garay in 1543 at barcelona moving a vessel by
sieam power has long since been looked upon with doubt
this was loo years before the steam engine was put
to anv practical use even in its crude form denis
papin and thomas savery had proposed the application of steam
to navigation about 1690 and the former is said to
have applied it on a model at a later date
the name of newcomn is also in timately associated with
these earliest experi ments and he is doubtless to be
credited with having built the steamengines used in 1736 jonatnan
hulls of england oliiaihed a patent upon what would be
termed a stern wheel boat for towing purposes the engine
for this boat was made by newcomen and the vessel
was d google steam vessels tested on the avon but
without enough success to attract needed capital and no further
efforts were made experiments were made in france from 1779
to 1783 by genevois and perrier when the marquis dc
fouffroy built on the river ci u gf 5d f

for 16 months nut defects de veloped in the machinery
so serious as to cause the project to be abandoned
for lack of money jounroy proposed a company to build
and operate steamboats but failed to gain support he has
however been credited in history as the true inventor ol
the steamboat patrick mil ler a wealthy retired banker of
scotland in 178s had a double hull boat constructed 25
feet long and seven feet broad and fitted with a
steamengine under the supervision of william symington it succeeded so
well that he built the next year a larger double
hull boat and a trial was made on the forth
and qyde canal in the summer of 1789 when seven
miles an hour was made the boat the wheels and
the engine were so ill proportioned to each other that
the wheels were continually breaking and the hull suffered so
much from the strain imparted by the machinery as to
be in danger of sinking the trial was not considered
to be a success and the vessel was shortly after
laid aside it was now over 10 vears before any
further trials were made in great britain it will be
noted that john fitchs experiments began in 1786 and patrick
miller did not begin until some two years later symington
had not lost faith in the project and succeeded finally
in interesting lord dundas one of the pro prietors of
the forth and clyde canal in steam propulsion for canals
and with his support in 1801 built the ckarlotte dundas
a stern wheel boat to tow the canal boats on
the canal instead of towing with horses the vessel was
56 feet long 18 feet beam and s feet in
depth and was fitted with an engine of 22 inches
cylinder by four feet stroke the trial was made in
march 1802 with two boats in tow and three and
onehalf miles per hour was made for a distance of
nearly 20 miles a great clamor arose as to the
probable destruction of the banks of the canal from the
violent agitation of the water produced by the paddle wheel
and the project was abandoned a further effort w symington
under the patron age of the duke of bridgewater came
to an end with the death of the duke and
symington reduced to poverty withdrew from further endeavor it was
now 10 years before anodier steam vessel was built in
great britain and in the meantime livingston and fulton had
constructed four steamboats for the hudson river and the raritan
for the new jersey line and the new orletau for
the western rivers while john stevens had built the fhanix
and sent her to sea from new york to philadelptiia
pa this vessel was built in 1812 at glasgow by
john wood for henry bell and was the first suc
cessful steam vessel in great britain the hull was 42
feet long by 11 feet beam and five feet six
inches deep and named comet by means of spur wheel
gearing the power was transmitted to two pairs of paddles
as this arrangement proved to be unsatisfactory the vessel was
fitted with a single pair of wheels and the hull
was lengthened to 60 feet and the engine power increased
the speed of this ves sel was originally five miles
per hour robert son the ennneer of the comet succeeded
in so improving her ennes as to raise the speed
to six miles per hour his success led him into
steamboat building on his own account and in 1813 he
started the clyde and in 1814 the tay caledonia and
humber all of whidi proved commercially profitable the first iron
hull steam vessel built in great britain was in 1822
named the aaron manby built al the horsley iron works
near birminam the vessel was 166 feet long and 16
feet beam and fitted with a 30 horsepower engine operat
ing oldhams revolving oars that enter and leave the water
edgewise first american steam vestela the pe riod when the
first experiment with a steam vessel in the united states
was made so far as the mechanical side was concerned
was any thing but inviting to those interested there was
not in the united states at the time one steamengine
in use and it is doubtful if the first principles
of its working were understood the american people were comparatively
poor at this time having but a few years prior
to this date returned to the peaceful pursuits of life
after the long and costly war of the revolution after
a few years the steam mania broke out and the
application of steam to navigation was under trial to john
fitch of connecticut must be given the credit for the
first steamboat in the united states itnperfect as it was
he made his first trial on 22 aug 1787 but
was not able to attain more than three miles an
hour this boat was propelled by 12 oars or paddles
five and a half feet whioi work perpendicularly and are
represented by the stroke of the paddle of a canoe
then in 1789 another boat was built that was fitted
with more power that developed on trial a rate of
speed of eight miles an hour these experi ments were
carried on by a company who fur nished the capital
for the enterprise and not meeting with die success anticipated
after three years labor refused to advance any more funds
for thf further prosecution of the enter prisej thus leaving
fitch to cany on his trials on his own account
this he did for a short time only as he
was unable to procure the means for the necessarv changes
in the vessel and it was this financial condition that
finallv forced him to abandon the whole business and he
went to france and england with his draw ings but
met with no belter fortune upon d google steam vessels
b5b his return in 17 he made an experiment on
he collect pond in new york in a common yawl
boat with both side wheels and again with a propeller
at the stern of the boat nothing seems to have
come from these later experiments fitch has been described as
hav inft been brought up from manhood as a watch
maicer and beine fond of mechanics through the prosecution oi
his trade he was continually experimenting along different unes and
at last drifted into the aiqdication of steam to navi
gation he no doubt had a small knowledge of the
steamengine but his peculiar disposition ever urged on by his
impulses subjected him to many disappointments there is no doubt
he accomplished more in propelling his boats than some others
have done at a later dale james rumsay a native
of maryland and a strong competitor in the experimental stage
of 1 navigation with john fitch i that year but
the results were unsatisfactory the best speed attained being three
miles per hour while the stale requirements were four miles
other trials were made the next year with another vessel
but with no better success the grant by the state
had now expired rob ert r livingston had been appointed
minister to france and while there had met robert ful
ton who had been engaged in experiments with the application
of steam to navigation among other things and in 1803
made a trial with a boat propelled by paddle wheels
which showed a abandoned in 1787 he constructed a boat
about 50 feet long that was propelled by ad mitting
water through a trunk on the keelson of the vessel
and by means of a steam pump discharging it at
the stem this boat was never put to any practical
use leaving the united states to his opponent rumsay sailed
for london where he built another vessel but he died
in 1793 following a successful exhibit of his craft another
name connected with the earliest experiments with steamboats in america
is that of samuel morey who in 1790 ran a
small boat with a paddle wheel at the bow on
the connecticut river and in 1797 operated a sidewheel steamboat
on the delaware river to oliver evans an engine builder
of penn sylvania must be given some credit for his
trials in steam navigation in 1802 he was called on
to construct an engine of nine indies cylinder by 36
inches stroke for a boat of 80 feet long and
18 feet beam built in kentucky for capt james mckeever
united stales navy and louis valcourt and floated to new
or leans la before the vessel was completed the river
had fallen so much as to leave the vessel high
and dry on shore ilie engine and boiler were taken
out and placed in a sawmill where they were in
use until the mill was destroyed by fire in 1804
he constructed for the city of philadelphia a machine for
dredging the slips of the city the machinery was fitted
in place on a large scow 30 feel long by
12 feet beam and was driven by a stem wheel
that was operated by a small steamengine it was driven
down the schuylkill river to the dela ware river and
up the latter river in all some 14 or 15
miles robert fulton after the withdrawal of fitch from the
activities of steam navigation and the death of riunsay there
does not seem to have been that mania for the
application of steam to navigation it languished for a time
but not long for robert r livingston of new york
who had been interested in moreys experiments was granted by
the new york legislature the exclusive privilege of navigating the
waters of the hudson wi5i a vessel pro pelled by
steam livingston was a man of wealth and had a
taste for mechanics he was associated with john stevens and
nicholas roosevelt in experiments with a steamboat fultoni ci en
u 1807 with improvement in the engine they might look
for better results the french paid no attention to these
achievements and fulton ac companied livingston back to america liv
ingston had the legislative privileges restored to him and fulton
for two years by the legis lature as those were
not complied with it was extended in 1807 for two
years john stevens then of new yorit but later of
hobo ken n j was also a man of large
means with a mechanical turn of mind his trials with
the screw propeller began in 1802 and lasted until some
time in 1806 in 1804 he had in operation on
the hudson a small vessel with a tubular boiler propelled
by twin fourbladed screws which attained a speed of about
nine miles per hour this was the first practical application
of the propeller to a vessel but the men who
at that time were working with steamboats had their minds
set upon paddlewheels and he screw propeller was ignored robert
fullon before leaving europe in 1806 had parts of a
steamengine duilt to his order by boulton and watt of
birmingham england that were shipped to new york he had
the hull of a vessel constructed at new york in
180607 and the engine from boulton and watt was fitted
on board this vessel was named clermont it was 140
x 13 x 7 feet deep and the engine having
a bell crank motion had a cylinder of 24 inches
diameter and four feet stroke her trial trip from new
york to albany was com menced on 17 aug 1807
the vessel was en larged during the following winter and
rechris tened the north river as there was no part
of the orinal clermont that was an invention of robert
fulton though he obtained patents at a subsequent date on
improvements his theoret ical knowledge of steam navigation and its
adaptation to practical purposes was the cause of his success
he knew very nearly all that had been done in
the way of experiments and his ability lay in selecting
those features that were of value and bringing them together
so d google 556 steam vessels they were first seen
in the clermont he must certainty have had mechanical ability
of no mean order for that day to have accomplished
so much at one stroke the first complete amevi canbuilt
steamboat both hull and ma chinery was the phtetiix constructed
in 1808 by john stevens and as fullon held the
exclu sive privilege of new york waters for steam vessels
stevens sent the vessel around to the delaware river leaving
new york 8 june 1809 to form part of a
line between new york and philadelphia about the same time
the rartlan was built to run from new york to
new bruns t of the new york monopoly eaily ferryboato
fulton and his asso ciates or the north river steamboat
company met much opposition in the proposition of their enterprise
and it became so bold after a time in placing
obstacles in the way during the running of their vessels
that they were com felled to resort to the legislature
of the state or a law to protect them in
their lawful rights there was one compaiw which built two
boats that were originally fitted with experimental engines that were
removed almost as soon as erected on board and steamengines
and boilers substituted in defiance of the monopoly of the
fulton company after three years in the courts the vessels
were delivered into the pos session of the fulton company
who broke them up this exclusive privilege was the cause
of a petition being laid before the new york legis
lature in 1814 by aaron ogden of new jersey who
desired to run a steamboat on his ferry to elizabeth
town n j but was prevented by liv ingston and
fulton the matter was at length compromised so that ogdcn
ran his boat he had a partner in his ferry
property named thomas gibbons of savannah ga who opened an
opposition line to ogden and it was on this route
and line cornelius vanderbilt began his steamboat career this opposition
commenced in 1818 was the cause of the lawsuit that
was carried to the united states supreme court where in
1824 a decree was entered against ogden thus breaking down
the steamboat monopoly the steam terryboat was first brought into
use by robert fulton on the ful ton ferry running
from new york to brooklyn in may 1814 hudson river
boats after the waters of the united states were thrown
open to the free navigation of steamboats in 1824 the
num ber of steam vessels increased on the hudson river
as that was the most expeditious mode of travel from
new york to albany as well as the best patronized
channel of travel from the seaboard to the western states
that were just then being opened to the settler the
new vessels were great improvements over the ves sels of
the north river company that now in many instances became
towboats for nearly 10 years later several lines were formed
that were well backed financially for that period until in
1832 when they were all consolidated in 1835 the peoples
line was opened with the westchester and the emerald the
most noted of the boats of this period were the
swallow and the rochester that were rivals on the new
york and albany route and for several years were very
often engascd in racing this was the openmg stage of
at fierce rivalry between the lines on the fiver that
was so well known for many years when at times
so intense has been the competition passengers have been transported
the entire length of the navigable river free of cost
of carriage this lasted until 1852 when the steamboat law
went into eifcct which brought the operation of our steamboats
jindcr the united states law and it was well it
did even at that late date the completion of the
hudson river railroad in the latter part of 1851 had
a great effect in dimining the num ber of steamboats
on the river since then the business on the river
has been in the hands of companies that have been
strong financially and who have catered to the public travel
with the better class of vessels suited to the service
the present hudson river day line was started in 1863
with the city of albany and was incorporated in 1879
the peoples ijne of night boats or new jersey steamboat
com pany had built in 1896 the adirondack that was
a marked advance upon the form of the previous vessels
of the line their first steel hull vessel the c
w morse appeared in 1904 the second hendrick hudson was
launched in 190 and leads the day line fleet which
in cludes also the robert fulton and the wash ington
irvittg there have been at different periods several ne boats
on the river possessed of high speed that may be
mentioned such as the daniel drew mary powell the fastest
vessel known until the torpedoboat destroyer was devised having a
speed record of 27 miles per hour thomas ponell the
auda and the first hendrick hudson long island sound communication
t water on long island sound dates back to 181314
when the fulton was constructed for service from new york
to new haven by cap tain bunker whose boats ho0e
and persever ance on the hudson had been seiied by
fulton and livingston under their monopoly and broken up on
account of the war of 1812 and the activity of
the british naval vessels off our coast at the time
it was deemed prudent to postpone the opening of the
new hne it was not until 21 march 1815 that
the vessel was placed on the route the firefly was
the first stoamer to round point juditn and sail into
newport this was in may 1817 in 1818 the connecticut
was brought out in the same inter est and run
from new york to new haven while the fulton was
run from new haven to norwich conn as it was
considered unwise 10 run a boai on such a long
rout as from new york to norwich conn at that
time these vessels thus ran until prevented by the passage
of the retaliatory law by connecticut in 1822 when ihey
ran to providence r i the unittd slates was purchased
in 1822 by new haven parties and ran to by
ram cave n y and this service continued until the
exclusive privilege of fulton and others was declared unconstitu tional
when the vessel was run direct from new york to
new haven this was the be ginning of the new
haven steamboat com pany other vessels followed of improved con
struction and larger and better accommoda tions they had their
periods of opposition and low fares as on other important
routes one of the fastest vessels tliat has thus far
been on the d google steam vessels line has been
the richard peck in 1899 a du plicate o this

providence r i was rst served with a steamboat line
in 1822 in the following six years three new steamboats
were built for the luie to new york and during
tha stdfrlever engine 1849 this period opposition began on the
route this had then become the most popular route from
new vork to the eastern states in 1835 cor selini
vanderbilt placed the lexington then a new boat on the
route and being one that de veloped in a short
time higher speed than those on the old line drew
a greater portion of the mssenger travel the boston and
new york transportation company had the boston the providmce and
ibe massachusttti in 1836 the ltsmglon was again on tiie
route in 1836 and having made it uvely for the
old companf they had the narragansett built to be on
even terms with the opposition as they thought but they
were miblaken the lexington was pur chased by the transportation
company in 1838 as another opposition line with the w
rich mond had presented itsdf for public favor the lexington
took fire while on a trip from new york to
stooington on 13 jan 1840 when off eatons neck loni
island there were at least 150 persons on doard and
all were lost except four after 184s the passenger service
to providence fell off to a great extent and it
was many years before it was resumed with a firstclass
passenger line stonington had be come the popular route the
new j9y steam navigation company controlled he business of this
route from 1840 to 186 when they withdrew their boats
from the service a ftrstclasi passenger line was not resumed
to providence until 1877 when the rhode island and the
massachusetts were placed on the route bv the stonington steamship
company and dien began the war of rates riiat lasted
ao ksng on long island sound these boats were fol
lowed by the connecticut and later by the plyimth mia
others the joy line commenced running lo providence in 1899
after the stontnfnon line was closed up in 1867 there
were no steaffltgtaat9 running to stonington until january 1868 when
the stonington railroad and the stonington these vessels ceedcd by
the rhode island no 3 and later by the two
propellers maine and the new hampshire the fall river line
was opened in 1amp47 with the bay state much the
largest and fastest steamer of her time and the next
year the empire state was added and a few years
later the metropolis the company was reorganized in 1863 and
a new fleet of boats built for the line that
did service until the con solidation with the narragansett steamship
company in 1874 the two famous steamers bristol and providence
of the merchants shipping company merit distinguished remem brance the
first iron hull vessel built with 96 watertight compartments was
the pilgrim added to the fall river line in 1883
and sub sequently the floating palaces puritan plymouth and prtscilta
were placed in commission the commonwealth the largest and fastest
of the fall river fleet represents the very highest type
of american river steamer of the sturdier class of side
wheelers to new london and norwich conn there were several
iines run up to 1860 when the norwich and new
york transportation company was orgarueed and the city of boston
and city of new york were built a few years
later three smaller pas senger and freight boats were built
in 1881 their first iron hull steamboat city of worces
ter was placed in service and in 1894 the steel
hull twinscrew propeller city of lowell was added to the
line this vessel has proved to be one of high
speed lake steamers steam navigation on the great lakes dates
from the year 1818 when the walkinthewater was built to
run on lake erie the most radical departure in steamboat
design and construction on the lakes was in the buillng
of the greo western in 1838 by the adding of
the upper cabin with btaterooms and converting the lower cabins
into steerage quar ters and freight compartments there were several
ne ana large sidewheel passenger boats built after 1345 after
the general style of the long island sound boats by
1849 there were 29 sidewhcelcrs and 10 propellers running out
of buffalo and by 1862 the number had in creased
to 147 sidewheelers and 203 propellers the extension of the
railroads along the shore of lake erie soon made their
business unprofit able since 1880 there have been several large
iron ot steel hull passenger boats built to run from
buffalo and cleveland to detroit and fitted with large engine
power that have proved themselves to be vessels of very
high speed lake ontario had its first steam vessel in
the late ontario built in 1816 there were sev er
lines of beamengine boats on the lake up to i860
when the railroads having absorbed the greater part of the
business several of the vessels were brought to the coast
by running the rapids of the saint lawrence river the
finest passenger steamer on the great lakes is the city
of cleveland running between detroit and oeveland the largest cargo
vessel in those waters is the william m miils with
a capacity of 514500 bushels of wheat or 12380 tons
of iron ore prominent among the cana dianbuilt lake steamers
are the immense freighters collingwood and midtaml prince gt google
sse stbah vesssls comt of maine steamboats the coast of
maine was first visited by a steam vessel ia 1823
there were many vessels running from boston mass to portland

sanford line began operations the portland steam packet company began
their operations in 1843 the iron hull propeller bangor running

november 1901 webtcm river steamboats the first steamboat constructed for
the western rivers was the new orieans built at pittsburgh
pa in 18u under the supervision of nicholas j roosevelt
for livingston and fulton several vessels were constructed for these
waters dur rivetlsteamcr 1s9s ing the next decade but of
a different form of hull and type of eine several
of them being more like those of a later date
the condi tions under which the steamboats on the west
ern rivers are operated are so different from those on
other rivers of the united states that they are required
in desipi to conform more closely to the surroundmg conditions
the allowness of the channel makes it necessary for the
hulls of these vessels to be of great length and
width in proportion to the depth of hull the ennes
are all poppet valves worked by levers with the cylinders
set hori lon tally on wooden frames generally the boilers
are usually plain cylinder with two flues each they are
worked noncondensing under a pressure of 100 to 12s pounds
to the square inch they are usually fitted with side
wheels but the sternwheel boat has been favored for some
service there were a few compound engines in boats on
the rivers several years ago which type of engine has
gained in favor again on the western rivers in more
recent times before the railroads in the western states be
came so numerous the passenger and freight business in that
section of the country was largely carried on by the
steamboats and at that tune there were many fine and
fast steam boats on the mississippi and the ohio rivers
and a few of large dimensions among the earlier steamers
on the mississippi were the moselle and oronoko memorable for
their boiler explosions and he pioneer and ontario which raced
often on the ohio there was in 1852 the eclipse

miles in 3 days 18 hours and 30 minutes the
natchez had run into a fog and grounded about 300
miles below saint louis that delayed her about six hours
ocean steamships there have been a few attempts made to
dispute the claim of the a vantiah as the pioneer
steamship of the atlantic ocean but when these attempts have
been closely examined it still leaves the american vessel at
the head of the list she was con structed at
new york in 1818 by francis fick ett as a
sailing packet originally but an auxil iary engine and boiler
with paddlewheels were fitted before she was placed in service
she was owned by parties at savannah ga on 24
may 1819 she left savannah for liver pool england which
port was reached in 27 days 80 hours of which
time she was operated by steam power on 29 september
she started en her return to the united states stopping
at saint petersburg stockholm and other baltic ports and arrived
at savann 30 november subsequently her machinery was removed and
the hull converted to a sailing vessel and run between
new york and savannah ga until driven ashore on great
south beach on long island 5 nov 1821 durii a
gale where she became a total loss the rising slar
built for the government of chile made the next west
ward crossing of the atlantic in 1822 arriving in valparaiso
in april she was a fuiirigged ship with an auxiliary
steamengine lucre was a long interval of time before another
american steamship crossed the atlantic ocean but during that period
much knowledge had beeti gained of steam navigation that was
of use in constructing ocean steamers the ocean steamship company
in j847 had the wathing toh and me herman built
for a line from new york to bremen they having
obtained a con tract to carry the united states mail
for 10 years in 1849 the new york and havre
steam navigation company obtained a contract to carry the united
states mail to havre and during the same year had
the franklin and the humboldt constructed for the line the
latter veasel having been lost in 1853 and the former
in 1854 the company ran the line with chartered vessels
until the arago and the ful ton were built and
placed on the line in 1855 this line was well
managed and received more american patronage than any other runnii
to the same ports these vessels ran until the opening
of the civil war in 1861 the next line of
american ocean steamships was the collins line organised about 1847
as the new york and liverpool united states mail steam
ship company the atlantic and the pacific were built in
1849 and the next year the baltic and the arctic
and antarctic were constructed for them at new york the
general dimen sions of these vessds were each 277 feet
long 45 feet beam and 31 feet depth of hold
their motive power was a pair of side lever engines
the first two vessels built having cylinders 95 inches by
9 feet stroke while the others were larger these engines
were of dgt google stbah vb88bl8 us t vel8 were
of 260 tons the line surted under a contract to
cariy die mail for 385 per annum which was subsequently
increased to 858000 yet with this large mail pay or
subsidy just as it is viewed and a krge share
of the passenger travel and freight it failed to be
a paying une tte rivalry existing with the cunard line
at tbis time was very great and the expenses of
operation in making record time voyages made a heavydram upon
the finances of the com pany there were also commercial
and pohti caj interests that were antagonistic to the com
lany so that by 18s7 congress had cut down the
appropriation for mail pay to less than the ongmal amount
and as the line could not be operated successfully under
these conditions the last vessel was withdrawn from the route
m january 185amp congress virtually froze out the company the

the pennsylvania rail road company was organized to nm a
line of steamships from philadelphia pa to liver sool it
will be noted that this was at the eginnmg of
the period when iron shipbuilding in the united states bean
to increase and the compound marine engine was coming into
favor the company had built in 187374 the peniuyhiania ohio
indiana and illinois these proved to he pood staunch and
serviceable ves seb for the line though only of average
speed under food conditions they subsequently eassed into the hands
of the international avigation compaiiy which absorbed the in man
line in 1886 tlie present american line is the result
of an act of congress of 1892 providing with other
conditions that certain foreignbuilt steamships should receive ameri can register
on coijition that steamships of corresponding jmage were built in
the united states ttoled to the city of paris and

being then abbreviated and new york contracts were then made
with the william cramp ship and engine building company for
the saint patu and the saint lovis they having the
first quadruple expansion engines built in the united states for
the atlantic service these vessels ran to southampton and cherbourg
they are ele gantly fitted and furnished in their passenger
accommodations are well patronized by the american traveling public and
have shown on more than one occasion that they are
possessed of more than average high speed in january 1903
the american and red star unes were consolidated with four
british lines as the international mercantile marine company coastwise stcunahipg
the robert ful ton built in 1819 was the pioneer
in the coast wise trade with steam vessels and ran
between new york and the island of cuba from 1820
to 1825 when it was sold to the brazilian gov
emment there were no steam vessels running coastwise from the
latter date till 1332 when a small steamboat named the
david brown was refitted and run from new york to
charleston s c in the next six years there were
five larger vessels built for the same route but of
the same general type of vessel after the loss of
one of these vessels in 1837 public confidence in thdr
safety became so shaken that they no longer found profitable
employ ment on the route and in a short time
were withdrawn the first steamships to be em ployed along
our coast were those built in 184647 to run between
new york and charles ton s c the southerner and
the northerner these vessels were the pioneers of the many
steam vessels that were built in a few years to
run on lines between the atlantic ports the largest development
of our early ocean steam marine began with the discovery
of gold in california during the civil war these coast
wise lines of side wheel steamers were dis continued then
they were opened again and gradually fell into financially strong
hands ig v google 860 steamboats stearic acid most of
them after 1870 began the tion of iron hall vessels
with compound pro peller engines and by 1880 had laid
aside the wooden hull vessels with the expensive beam engine
or the simple condensing propeller en gine so that at
the present time we find a fine fleet of large
vessels running from all our prin cipal ports on the
coast that are operated at a mudi less cost for
same size of vessel than those in the same service
30 years or more ago wfaalebacks these vessels have a
main deck rounded over and resemble the back of a
whale they are for use in rough water the waves
passing completely over them without resistance or injury the first
one was built for a baltimore company about 1860 sucb
vessels arc now used as grain carriers on the great
lakes and more recently as passenger vessels as oilcarriers this

in this count ryihsajl years ago these vessels must not
be confuwl with a twinscrew vessel having two stern of
a vessel the pioneer of the latc velopment was the
bergen built in 1888 for i hobokcn ferry having a
triple expansion l gine since then this type of ferryboat
has been growing in favor until at this time it
has practically driven the oldfashioned side wheeler out of use
except on the shorter screw propeners after john stevens ex
periments with the screw propeller in 1802 to 1806 there
was nothing done in this country to practically demonstrate the
value of the screw until the robert f stockton having
an erics son propeller was brought to this country in
1839 then the propeller began to come into use both
on the atlantic coast as well as on lake erie
and lake ontario and it is alto gether probable that
its largest development in the first decade was on the
northern lakes smmiiuy the progress in the develop ment of
the modern steam vessel may be sum marized by divisions
into decades marked by salient advances between 184s and 1855
iron was substituted for wood in the hulls of steam
vessels and the boiler pressure was advanced from 10 pounds
to 20 pounds per square inch the coal con sumption
being reduced from 4s pounds to 3s pounds per horse
power per hour of propulsion the boiler pressure was creased
to 35 pounds and the coal consumption dropped to three
pounds per horse power per hour between 1855 and 1875
the compound engine was introduced the boiler pressure went up
to 60 pounds and the coal went down to 25
pounds per horse power per hour between 1875 and 188s
steel superseded iron in hull construction and the tripleexpansion engine
came into use the boiler pressure was advanced to 2s
pounds and the coal con sumption fell to two pounds
per horse power per hour between 13b5 and 18 twin
screw propul sion with quadruple expansion engines and the principle
of the forced draught were brought into use the boiler
pressure rose to 200 pounds and the coal consumption dropped
to 15 pounds per horse power per hour the decade
1895 to i90s was one of transi tion a few
turbines appeared and the steam pressure in compound engines reached
a maxi mum of 225 pounds between 1905 and 1915
turbine engines came generally into use and the boiler pressures
came down to 160 to 175 pounds at which figures
the turbines were most effective the coal consumptjotr also decreased
to 12 pounds per hoise power per hour see also

therefore of whether h possesses or not the property of

university steel the bessemer process the bessemer process is employed
to manu facture from the crude product of the blast
furnace a comparatively low grade of steel which is at
the same time better suited for certain purposes than that
manufactured by any other process it does not seek to
mske highgrade tool steel or steel castings but a cheaper
grade for which there is an im mense demand for
instance steel rails and structural shapes it occupies a field
in which it is and probably always will be sireme
so long as die supply of suitable riw material lasts
many modificatians of the bessemer process have been introduced most
of which have not met with approval but one or
two have become commercially recognised such as the clappgriffiths the
robert and the tropenas processes these latter by variations in
the method of applying the blast or by modifications in
the modus operandi have made changes in the resulting product
so that it may be successfully applied to the manufacture
of castings ttc but uiey are all essentially besse mer
converters farther notes on these proc esses will appear later
in this article to get a fair idea of the
revohitionary nature of bessemers invention mention must be made of
the fact that before his time steel on amount of
the difampculty of its manufacture was in use for practically
little else but cut lery springs and the small parts
of machines it had to be made in crucibles by
melting ce mented baj or blister stee itself the result
of a long and costly operation on swedish iron in
a cementation furnace a steel rail build ing or bridge
was unthought of everything might iron made at great expenditure
of ime and human energy in the pud r charcoal
bloomery e puddling furnace the story of bessemers discovery is
of un usual interest experiments had been made from time
to time to improve iron castings by the addition of
wroutiron scrap to pig iron in a cupola and bessemer
had achieved more success than his contemporaries by die use
of a reverberatory furnace instead of a cupola into whidi
he had introduced great improve ments such as a hollow
bridge wall through which jets of air were forced giving
a higher temperature enabling him to fuse more steel in
the bath of cast iron how he came to dis
cover that great principle on which all air blast processes
of stedmaking are based is best told in his own
words in connection with the description of some experiments with
his forced draft reverberatory furnace he says some pieces of
pig iron on one side of the furnace attracted my
attention by remaining unmelted in the great heat of the
furnace and i turned on a httle more air through
the fire bridge with the intention of increasing the combustion
on again opening the furnace door after an interval of
half an hour these two pieces of pig iron still
remained unfused i then took an iron bar with the
intention of pushing them into the bath when i discovered
that they were merely thin shells of decarbur ized iron
showing that atmosferic air alone was capable of wholly decarburizing
gray pig iron and converting it into malleable iron with
out puddling or any other manipulation thus another direction was
given to my thoughts and after due deliberation i became
convinced that if air could be brought into contact with
a sufficiently extensive surface of molten crude iron it would
be rapidly converted into malle able iron with great enthusiasm
bessemer proceeded to the next step namely the experimental test
ot his conviction he procured a crucible hav ing a
perforated cover and a pipe of refractory material passing through
the lid connected to a blast supply a small quantity
of cast iron was melted in the crucible and while
still in the furnace a current of air was passed
through d google 664 stbel tmb bbssbher proceamps it after
30 minutes blowing the contents of the crucible were found
to be soft malleable iron the next thing to be
determined was whether the chemical reactions caused by the blowing
would generate sufficient heat to keep the contents of the
crudble liquid without any additional heat bdng applied from outside
liiis seemed a preposterous idea that blow ing air inio
molten iron should only not solidify it in a short
time but actually increase its tem perature very materially but
bessemer was confident it would be so and immediately set
about the construction of a converter the first converter was
about four feet in height cylin drical having a flat
top with a circular open ing and six horiiontal tuyeres
around the bottom fed by a circular blast pipe its
capacity was about 700 weight of iron which was introduced
by a sort of funnel in the side after the
blast was turned on the first blow was full of
surprises for what took place could be readily seen whereas
in the former experiments in the crucible the entire apparatus
was out of sight for the first few minutes sparks
and smoke were emitted from the converter but then a
flame burst forth whidi increased in violence so that no
one could go near the converter then the flame died
down and the metal was tapped out throuih a hole
in the bottom of the converter and found to be
malle able the possibilities of the process were now demonstrated
beyond the ditest doubt but prodigious jabors were yet to
be undertaken 10 order to make it mechanically perfect the
chief difficulties were that during the operation large quantities of
slag and some drops of iron were blown out of
the converter and that the blast had to be kept
on during the whole time of introducing the charge and
also tapping it out when converted many changes were made
in the interior shape to obviate the first the height
was increased and a double dome shaped top added with
the idea that any pro jections of slag and iron
would strike the dome and drop back into tiie converter
this was fairly successful and was the type of con
verter used in the first public exhibition of the process
in order to overcome the necessity of keeping up the
blast while filling and emptying the converter the shape which
is so well known today was evolved after a great
many changes and experiments it had to be a movable
vessel in order to bring the metal away from the
tuyeres and permit of shutting off the blast and so
a shape somewhat ovat and with a mouth inclined to
one side at an angle the whole mounted on trunnions
became the stand ard bessemer converter other vast improve ments
came quickly the hydrauhcaliy driven rack and pinion to rotate
the converter the hydrauuc crane for handung the ladle and
the casting pit for handling of ingots and molds one
of the difficulties encountered was the mix ing of the
slag with the iron and this was over come by
providing a ladle having an opening at the bottcmn which
was closed by a refrac tory stopper attached to a
rod the iron was run into the ladle and the
stopper held in posi tion till it was full then
as the slag floated the stopper was withdrawn allowing perfectly
clean metal lo run into the ingot molds the bessemer
process has another peculiar ure iir iis history in that
it hat been twice invented when he took out united
slates patents in 1856 bessemer was confronted at once by
a priority of claim to invention by william kelly the
contention was sustained in the united states courts and kelly
was granted a patent it is now not doubted that
while the two men independently and separately discovered the principle
kelly was ahead of bessemer some eiht or nine years
in his dis covery kelly was in the iron business
in ey ville ky in 1846 refining iron in an
old fashioned refinery to make kettles used in the manufacture
of sugar he was an inventive genius but a poor
business man an inspiration came to him one day while
watching the progress of his resnery on noticing that at
a certain place where the blast of air happened to
play on the molten iron direct without the td uadhn
romir coavuter intervention of any fuel it became white hot
and boiled violently he immediately realized the revolutionary nature of
his discovery and his knowledge of metallurgy easily furnished him
yfith the explanation namely that the car bon content of
the iron was acting as fuel and by its combustion
increasing the temperature of the iron it was later discovered
that the lar gest addition of heat arose from the
oxidation of the silicon content and that where less than
one per cent of silicon exists in the iron the
besse mer process fails on speaking of his hopes he
was met with derision but proceeded to make a public
demonstration which convinced all who saw it but as with
nearly all important dis d google 8tbbl the busatur process
covcries there was a hard battle ahead of kelly there
is always a prejudice against revolutionary discoveries and kellys customers
refused to accept iron refined by the new method even
thotigfa it passed the customary tests his financial backins vrat
also withdrawn but kelly could not be extingnished how he
i die forest and finally got pennlssioo from tfae cambria
iron works to erect a converter the eighth he bad
constructed in their worics and bow after a disastrous commencement
suc cess was finally achieved are familiar stories kelly was
recognized at the inventor of the bessemer process and while
bessemers patents were refused renewal kellys were renewed he died
in 1388 the bessemer procns todar in mod em american
practice the pi iron is omelimes used direct in a
fluid condition from the blat furnace and sometimes remelted in
cupolas rapid workinr is the object aimed at so as
to avoid loss of neat by radiation and permit of
the use of lower silicon in the pig iron to
day but little more than 1 per cent of silicon
is permitted in the charge and the blow is made
in from 9 to 12 minutes with a larger pro
portion of silicon the blow is unduly pro longed even
with this comparatively low content of silicon the blows are
sometimes too hot and steel scrap has to be added
in the con verter during the blow to cool it
off in place of scrap a jet of steam is
sometimes turned on as regards the capacity of the converter
any thing less than 10 tons is considered a small
converter and the usual amount treated at one time is
from 10 to 20 tons two types of the bessemer
process are in use known respec tively as the acid
process and the basic process the difference lies in the
character of the lining with which the converter is fitted
in the first named type this lining is of acid
material chiefly silica held togethei with fireclay and m the
second type it is of basic qoauty generally caldned dolomite
held together with a small proportion of tar in the
latter case a percentage of lime is added to the
charge before the blowing begins the purpose being the formation
with the silica of a basic sktf which does not
attack the lining in the acid process the sulfur and
phos phorus elements of the iron are not removed the
acid slag refusing to dissolve them it is imperative tnerefore
that iron selected for the acid process should contain less
than 10 per cent of phosphorus and less than os
per cent of sulphur in order to yield a grade
of bes semer steel acceptable to the market in the
basic process the oxidized silicon is readily ab sorbed by
the basic sla and hence is more wiickly removed than
it is in the acid process the carbon ingredient is
next eliminated and following that condition the phohihorus and a
part ot the sulphur are absorbed by the basic lime
slag the basic process is molt largely in use in
regions where the tgtosphorus con tent of the iron is
large particularly in ger many and great britain in the
united states the add process prevails almost universally the lining
generally consists of brick sand or ttone and the walls
are lined to a thickness of about one foot the
bottom section of the b86 converter containing the tuyeres is
separate from the main section and is about 26 inches
thick on account of the great amount of corro sion
that takes place there and each vessel has a number
of extra bottoms so that they can be quidcly changed
when burned out the diameter of tfie tnyeres is about
half an inch the pressure of blast varies from 30
to 10 pounas the former being used at the com
mencement of the blow and the latter being the lowest
it would ever be safe to reduce it to and
this only when the blow is particularlj hot or the
projections of slag excessive sufficient air must always be kept
on to support the iron and prevent it running into
the tuyeres and wind box the converters are rotated to
suit the exigencies of blowing and recdving or pouring the
metal by means of a pinion at tached to the
trunnion and a hydraulically driven rack the illustrations to this
article give a good idea of the develoikncnt of the
converter from the earliest type the clappgriffiths beasemer this proc
ess which is now practically obsolete was one of the
earlist types of baby bessemer con verters its capacity was
from two to three tons a stationary sideblown converter was
used having a slag spout at one side from which
the slag poured during the boil the converter was in
two sections bdng jointed on a line above the tuyeres
and the bottom section was handled and put in place
on a car which could be lifted by a hydraulic
ram the only original feature of the converter was the
slag spout and the benefit derived from its use was
always problematical it was claimed that the steel made in
this converter even though high in phosphorus was vastly superior
to that made in ordinary converters this daim was of
course not substantiated the robert process in this process a
rotary converter was used with horizontal tuyeres placed tangentially in
order to impart a rotary motion to the metal the
tuyeres were submerged but near to the surface of the
bath whilst the loss was greater than in tlie ordinary
vessel a hotter sted was made which was suitable for
steel castings and for this purpose it was almost exclusively
used the tropeam procaaa this has been by far the
most successful develoianent of the bessemer process for casting woric
introdndng the idea that the violent mechanical disturbance of the
bath is unnecessary and that the more tranquil the bath
is the purer sounder and better will be the steel
a rotary side blown converter of two tons capadty is
used and the tuyeres are arranged in a syimnetrical posi
tion from the centre tuyere in order that any tendennr
to stirring or rotation may be neutral ized the tuyers
moreover are never beneath the surface of the metal though
they approach it very closdy a second row of tuyeres
is placed a few inches higher than and parallel with
the lower tuyeres and when the carbon flame appears these
tuyeres are ened admit ting air to complete the cmnbustion
of carbon from co to co the result of this
is to increase the temperature of the bath by radia
tion a high sihcon high manganese mixture is used in
ttie converter and results in exceed ingly hot and fluid
steel which can be car iq v google stbbl succthical
frocbssbs of manufacturs tied around in hand ladles and poured
into very small and complicated shapes when the blast is
first started the surface only of the nietal is oxidized
three pounds pressure of air being used and by dilution
and change of specific gravity a fresh surface is constantly
presented to the action of the blast without any mechanical
disturbance whatever in this way the possility of occluded gases
is reduced to a minimum no more air hein intro
duced than is necessary for the chemical re action the
fact remains however that for casting basic open hearth steel
is greatjy pre ferred the roll of honor the history
of the de velopment of the bessemer process in the
united states is the history of a company of the
brightest minds this country has produced there is no doubt
that the bessemer process is worked more perfectly in america
than else where and the credit must be given to
those brilliant men who in the early days gave their
great intellects to its problems and overcame them the most
important work has been done by a l holley john
and george friii wil liam r jones and robert w
hunt to alex ander lyman holley one of if not
the fore most american engineers were granted 10 pat ents
in connection with the bessemer process alone some of them
being raised converters hydraulic cranes accinnutatin ladles and con verter
bottoms holley investigated the besse mer process in england in
1863 and realizing its possitulities and also its defects obtained
the only american license and set to work to perfect
its machinery the latest and most im portant of the
modern improvements is the orage r 5 of irt ceiver
in which the various quantities dirert from the blast furnace
arc stored and equalized so that the silicon is uniform
in the converter one of the most important links in
this perfectly welded chain was the work of robert mushet
who devdoped the method of recarburizii the iron after blowing
in the con verter the swedish method of checking the
blowing when the carbon had been reduced to the proper
percentage proved too slow and uncertain mushets plan was to
burn out all tile carbon and restore a right proportion
by the addition of a quantity of melted spiegeleisen about
10 per cent after the blow without his method the
bessemer process could not have been a commercial success considerable
trouble was caused in the early days by the con
fliction of die bessemer and kelly patents the winslow griswold
and holley company at troy had control of the bessemer
patents covering the important and essential machinery and the owners
of the kelly and mushet tents could not operate without
the use of this ma chinery in fact each side
was necessary to the other and naturally this resulted in
an agree ment by which a jointstock company of all
the pneumatic steel manufacturers was made all the patents on
these processes have now ex pired according to the 1914
census of manu factures there were in the united states
in that year 9146 plants engaged in the mufac lure
of bessemer steel their combined prod uct was 6219304 tons
of ingot steel and 43437 tons of castings the decline
in the use of bessemer steel in favor of open
hearth steel is markedly indicated by the decrease of nearly
3000000 tons in the annual production for the census period
190914 for the former and an equal gain for the
latter the production of open hearth steel in 1914 was
over 17000000 tons nearly three times that of the bessemer

processes of manufacture electromeiallurgical processes for the manufacture of pig
iron steel and ferroalloys have received profound attention from a
commercial point of view during the years of this century
in fact a commercial production of electric steels seems to
coincide almost exactly with the opening of the 20th century
for we have it as a matter of record that
three days before its beaming heroult delivered to messrs schneider
and company creusot france a carload of electric steel bars
this is the first record we have of a commercial
sale and delivery of such steel experiments were made and
basic patents covering different processes were taken out during the
closing years of the 19th century it is over 40
years however since sir william siemens constructed and patented an
electric arc furnace which would melt steel it is not
recorded that he believed this laboratory furnace was the begin
ning of the new industry but whether he thought so
or not he stated very clearly the reasons why electric
furnaces should be su perior to other furnaces where the
product is in contact with the products of combustion of
carbonaceous fuel the advantages of electric melting as stated by
siemens are first the neutral atmosphere third the operation can
be carried on in a laboratory without much prepa ration
and under the eye of the operator fourth the limit
of heat practically obtainable with the use of ordinary refractory
material is very high because in the electric furnace the
fusing material is at a higher temperature tham the crucible
whereas in ordinary fusion the temperature of the crucible exceeds
that of the material fused within it tn short he
says that the function of electric melting is to effect
50ch reactions and decompositions as require for their accomplishment an
intense degree of heat coupled with freedom from such dis
turbing influences as are inseparable from a furnace worked by
the combusuon of carbona ceous materials the soundness of these
conclusions as applied to commercial conditions have been amply confirmed
during the past decade it seems like the fiiuslment of
proph ecy tor they were overlooked and all but for
gotten for nearly a generation until there arose a group
of engineers and inventors in several european countries during the
closing years of the last century who perfected various processes
for doincr in the mills what siemens had done in
the laboratory the entbusiasiic claims of these inventors wtc not
received d 6 google steel electrical processes op hahupacturb u7
with much interest by the steel men but the canadian
government displayed commendable foresight when it appointed a commission in
1903 to investigate these processes at first hand in europe
and in iheir report in 1904 professor harbord the metallurgist
of the com mission stated first that steel equal in
all respects to the best sheffield crucible steel could be
produced either by the kjellin heroult or keller processes at
a cost considerably less than the cost of producing high
class crucible steel and second at present structural steel to
compete with siemens or bessemer steel cannot be economically produced
in the electri cal furnaces and such furnaces can be
used commercially tor the production of only very hi class
steel for special purposes even this pinion of a competent
observer was not sufficient to overcome the conservatism of the
crucible steel malcers the venerable crucible process had withstood the
competition of besse tner steel and of acid and basic
open hearth steel and it yim only natural that the
new arrival should be viewed with distrust at the time
of this report the writer found it very difficult to
accept harbords first con elusion except in so far as
it applied to the indtiction type of furnace in which
at that time no purification of the charge was attempted
and to make a good steel one started with selected
raw materials just as in crucible melt ing the combination
of melting and refining in one operation did not appear
promising ana such samples of sieel as came under examina
tion both foreign and domestic did not tend to change
this opinion metallursically considered electric furnaces are of two kinds
first the early melting furnaces analogous to the crudble steel
process for example the earlier girod or the colby and
kjellin induction furnaces and second smelting or refining furnaces such
as the keller or heroult furnaces for either pig iron
or steel in furnaces of the melting type we must
start with the best raw matenals if we wish to
produce the best steel furnaces of the second type may
be used a for the electric refining of pig iron
direct from the blast furnace h for melting and refining
cold pig iron and scrap c for the direct reduction
of iron from its ores with or without subsequent refining
to produce steel d the electric refining furnace such as
the heroult may be used as an adjunct to the
open hearth or bessemer process m which the preliminary melting
and refining is done electrically con sidered these furnaces include
a arc fur naces eg the slassanno process b heroult
pigiron furnaces in all of which there is a movable
carbon electrode and the hearth constitutes a fixed electrode these
fur naces are especially suited to the reduction of iron
ore the charge of ore lime and coke constituting a
resistance conductor between the movable electrode and the fixed electrode
in the gin process a current is passed ihrou the
melt itself making use of ihc joule ctlect in the
girod crucible process we have what may he called a
furnace of the superficial resists type the current does not
pass through charge itself the furnace consists of a cru
cible of refractory materials surrounded by a granular carbon resistance
material to which the current is conveyed by solid carbon
con ductors and the whole device is enclosed in a
refractory chamber of nonconducting ma terials for thermal and electrical
insulation d the induction furnace invention is due to e
a colby but kjellin schneider and others employed the same
principle in that the heating current is an induced one
generated in an annular bath of metal constituting a single
tumsecondaiy of a stepdown transformer in the original colby patents
the primary windings of the transformer surrounded both the electro
magnet and the crucible itself in the kjellin process the
primary winding is close to one leg of the electromagget
and both are surrounded by the singleturn secondary or crucible
itself it would appear that there miht be an ad
vantage in dividing the primary winding into two parts one
within and one without the cruciblesecondary in other words in
com bining the colby and kjcliin constructions in the same
furnace in the limited space of this article only a
few typical processes can be described illustrating some of the
abovemen tioned general principles of construction the variety of details
of construction are very numerous but the underiying pnnciples are
not so numerous in fact vrhile sodalled new proc esses
have been introduced frequently during the past 15 years they
do not constitute essen tially new discoveries but differ onl
in details of application of the electric heating and of
furnace construction before describing a few of the processes it
may be said that in the earlier days of electric
steel furnaces it was considered that they could only be
installed in places most favorrfily lo cated for a cheap
supply of power or in places where metallurgical fuel such
as coal and coke was extremely scarce and high priced
the earlier furnaces were all of me singlephase type and
in the case of those employing elec trodes only one
or two electrodes were used about 10 years ago threephase
furnaces with three electrodes came into use and since that
time furnaces with from four to six electrodes have been
produced in the larger sizes the cheapening of power costs
in many localities has brought about a much more general
in troduction of these furnaces than was con templated even
by their inventors another early idea in regard to electric
furnaces oper ation was that they could only be used
cororacr ciatly for refsning material previously melted in the open
hearth or the bessemer the first installation in the united
states which was made at the plant of the halcomb
3teel company was of this type and the electric furnacd
which was of four gross ton capacity was used for
refining material melted in a 20ton basic open hearth furnace
this in stallation is still in use after 13 years
of con tinuous service an identical installation was started in
germany at almost the same time today furnaces operated on
cold charges are much more numerous than those employing the
original duplex process and they are located in places that
formerly would have been thought unsuitable for such installations the

in the top of the furnace the furnace is of
the arc type and as the elec trodes are not
in contact with the material that is to be melted
it is plain that np impurities are introduced into the
melt from the electrodes themselves either iron or steel may
be pro duced depending upon the mixture used with the
earlier furnaces of this type the hearth large electrodes pass
through the roof of the furnace in the singlephase furnace
such as was first used exclusively the current passes down
one of these electrodes crosses a narrow air gap through
the slag into the melt and is then conducted back
through ihe slag and an other air gap to the
second electrode alter nating current of about 100 volts is
used the rotated dui4ng the operation at a small ancle
to the vertical facilitating the mixture of he ingredients and
the reactions taking place in them this process is still
in use in italy with both rotating and stationary hearths
its use has not been adopted to any very eat
extent in other countries and some of the install alions
that were made in this country have been aban doned
it was found that tne arc placed so high above
the charge produced an excessive heating of the refractories of
the roof and that the expense for upkeep was high
the furnace is capable however of producing high quality steel
heroult procebs this process as applied to the production of
steel makes use of an arc resistance tilting furnace usually

of tha electrode width of the air gap is automatically
regulated by very ingenious devices which automatically raise or lower
the electrode as the resistance in the circuit varies too
steel or structural materials and especially alloy steels can be
made by this process in this furnace either from a
charge of cold materials or from a liquid charge previously
melted in some other fur nace the charge may consist
of miscellaneous scrap ore and lime and usually some fluor
spar sand and lime are used for the prepara tion
of slags toward the end of the process when it
is desired to remove both sulphur and phosphorus from the
charge it is custom ary to rake off the first
slag formed during the meltingdown period and with it goes
most of the phosphorus the operation during this riod l
xidizing after the phosphoi google stbblblbctiucai procbsses op manupacturb is
removed a second slas usually known as a carbide tiag
is fonned and under reducing conditions in the furnace the
sulphur is vety largely eliminated in this particular the elec
tric processes of several types are far superior to any
other processes for removing sulphur when such furnaces are used
in conjunction with the basic open hearth furnace ie bur
den of dephosioriiing is borne by the basic open hearth
and desulphurizing and deoxi dizing only are done in the
electric furnace and the operation is carried out entirely under
re ducing conditions made by the canaan commission tiy dr
v engelhardl and by the writer during the earlier years
of its operation the furnace as described by dr haanet
constitutes a step down transformer a primary coil of insulated
wire is wound about one leg of he magnetic circuit
the secondary is formed by the charge in an annular
groove also surrounding the same leg of the magnetic circuit
in the original kjelkn furnace at gysinge sweden the primal
alternating current is delivered at 90 volts and 3000 amperes
the secondary current induced in the charge itself is of

that at the time of taking out bis patents in
1890 he had any idea that the process mit be
used on a large scale for steel mdting ten jars
later kjelun in sweden empjim the principle of induction to
the con struction of electrical furnaces for steel melt ing
and since the results of these later experi mems have
been made public colby has also designed a furnace for
similar use the kjeflin process was put into actual service
in sweden about 1900 producing a merchantable product mostly tool
steel and ha been made the subject of many careful
investigations this process naturally attracted the attention of makers of
highgrade steels as the nearest substitiite for the old process
of crucible melt ing the furnace was studied in operation
and careful investigations of ibe product were potential and the
conversion of electric energy into heat takes place in the
substance of the charge itself the furnace may be either
acid or basic lined but the latter is most used
ibe lining constituting he annular groove or crucible being usually
made of magnesite the furnace may be either tilting or
stationary no attempt was made at purification of he ma
terials used but carefully selected raw ma terials well melted
gave an excel tent steel the analysis of which was
nearly the mean of the constituent materials of the mixture
this of course is a more expensive way of producing
tool steel than by refining processes but it is the
surest way and processes depending upon refining methods can never
be as certain in their results as the crucible or
the induction process in which raw materials of known impurity
are employed iarger furnaces of the induction lype were later
produced in germany in which by a special arrangement google
670 stebl evolution of stbklhakinq proce8sb8 of the hearth refining
was possible bnt in both the simpler and these more
complicated fur naces the question of repair of linings was
very serious and it can scarcely be considered that they
have been a commercial success some very large ones were
installed in this country but it is understood that they
have been abandoned as uncommercial one elec trical disadvantage is
that thes furnaces for best operation require a current of
imusually low frequency the modified kjellin furnace adapted to refining
is known as the rochling rodenhauser furnace the induction furnace
can operate upon two kinds of mixtures first pig iron
or scrap and second pig iron scrap and ore briquettes
conclusioiib of the many other processes two may be mentioned
which employ the prin ciple of bottom electrodes the amprod
furnace makes use of watercooled metallic electrodes imbedded in the
bottom lining of the furnace so that the current actually
passes throurft the charge itself from top to bottotn llie
greaves etch ells fifrnaee a fairly modern english process makes
use of the principle of a conductive hearth itself and
no inserted electrodes are used the entire bottom after the
furnace is once heated liecomes a resist ance conductor and
is supposed to produce beneficial results by heating the materials
at the bottom of the charge more perfectly ihan can
be done by an overhead arc furnace and this advantage
is supposed to be most marked in the manufacture of
alloy steels especially diose of heavy metals such as tungsten
which sink through the bath and are apt to lie
on the bottom of the furnace without bdn entirely molten
or absorbed by the charge itself it is difficult to
compare the various processes 39 to their efficiency in the
first place at no one plant have all of them
been tried under uniform conditions and skill of operation there
are so many variables entenne into the matter that comparisons
can be made only in one or more particulars for
example the ctlrrent consumption per ton of product can be
readily compared but unless the furnaces com pared are operating
under similar conditions and on a similar product the figures
are quite valueless moreover in tnelting a similar qual ity
one furnace may require more current than another simply because
the melter refines his steel more perfectly and the kilowatts
used may make the difference between well and poorly melted
steel other variables are the liie of the roofs bottoms
side walls and electrodes the first cost of the furnace
and the quality of construction and from the powerhouse point
of view simplicity and the cost of equipment must be
considered and this involves differ ences of phases frequency voltage
and power factor when all of these elements are con
sidered together with case of operation it is apparent that
it is not simple to give ofthand judgment as to
what furnace is best to use the rime is past
when the electric current itself is supposed to confer any
mysterious benefits upon the products but its function is just
as stated by siemens 40 years ago various claims are
made by inventors depending upon whether the current passes through
the bath horizontally or vertically or is merely radiated to
the surface however it should be remem bered that at
the temperature involved molecu lar mobility is very great and
solution and diffusion will take place satisfactorily if the total
heat available il suffidenl to maintain the entire contents of
the bath perfectly fluid the electric processes under most careful
handling are capable of producing steel approx inutely equal to
cnidble steel but each process has its peculiar field and
while some crucible tonnage may be diverted to electric steel
yet it is more likely that electric steel will find
its own market in the most exacting requirements of steel
for structural and tensile prlt4erties such as have come about
almost simultaneously with the processes themselves namely for the automobile
and airplane partj crucible steels for these purposes are not
commercial because of the dimculty of making very low or
medium carbon alloy steels in the crucible and the ton
nage demand is far ixyond what could be met by
the crucible proceis the electric furnace was apparently invented to
meet a new demand rather than to replace an old
process as one writer has said the luxury of today
is the necessity of tomorrow saiety cannot be measured by
prfce and public pinion will more and more insistently tall
for the highest excel lence in the automobile the airplane
and other forms of fabricated material there are now in
use in the united states between 300 and 400 electric
furnaces of vari ous types over half of them being
of the heroult design there probably as maiiy furnaces altogether
in bure as there are in the united slates the
introduction of the process vas stimulated amazingly by war re
quirements for materials of unusually high grade and in meeting
these requirementj the electric steel makers responded nobly in their

sense that we harden steel for tools is extremely improbable
it is not easy to say whether the bronze age

however in certain ruins of he swiss lake dwellings all

of iron is frequently mentioned in the early books of
the old testament tbe egyptians were familiar with it at
least 4000 years ago the assyrians probably knew how to
obtain iron from its ores and bow to fashion it
into saws chbels etc at a still earlier date than
the egyptians the various ages known as the stone bronze
and iron ages are not fixed periods in the worlds
history but are periods in the history and development of
individual tribes and nadons for example while at a period
say 1000 bc the egyptians and as syrians were making
swords of iroti uid a crosscut twiohandecl saw of this
period is in the british museum the bronze age existed
in southern europe while in the northern and western europe
wood and stone implements were in general use in india
chma and japan there is abundant evidence of the manu
facture and use of iron at a very early period
in this very day there are tribes in central africa
which have but attained the degree of stall which we
picture in our minds when the iron age is mentioned
they are making iron in a most primitive fashion and
their methods may be the identical ones used thou sands
of years ago by the assyrians their metallurgical skill is
by not means slight for they know how to smelt
ores in a little cupola blown by a hand bellows
and to employ the right fluxes to obtain a product
of remarkably sood analysis they use charcoal as fuel and
the chunks of metal which they obtain hy first smelting
are sold to smiths who refine them still further by

manganese trace there are evidences in belgium of ancient iron
workings dating from the roman occupa tion and they were
famous armorers through many centuries the skilled workmen of this
country emigrated especially lo england and sweden and were the
founders of the fine steel industries in those oountries those
who emigrated were the walloon belgians and the esodus became
so great that at one time it was stopped by
law during the time of the nomuui conquest and the
tudors the manufacture of iron in great britain was an
insignificanl industry and the chief supplies were imported from bel
giuol and from belgium came the invention which gave a
great impulse to the iron and steel business viz the
invention of the blast fur nace prior to this invention
iron was pro duced direct from ore in a crude
form of hearth the product being wrought iron or steel
which was obtained in a solid or pasty condi tion
far from homogeneous in composition and when large or intricate
forms were desired they were made from these crude materials
by laborious welding and forging methods witn the invention of
larger and improved blast fur naces 1 the belgians it
was found that prac tical a new metal fused casl
iron was at the disposal of the early metallurgist cast
iron was made in sussex as early as 1350 and
the art of iron founding gradually grew and flour ished
in england and on the continent until in 1543 casliron
cannon were made in kngland and in 1595 these were
made as heavy as three tons each but cast iron
was not only used for laundry purposes for it was
argued that if by one application of the purifying influence
of fire the crude metal had been prepared from the
ores the second application of the same agency might convert
it into a malleable prod uct and wrought iron was
subsequently pro duced in small fineries and from that day
to this the blast furnace has been the first step
in the manufacture of iron and steel much of this
early wrought iron was delightfully low in sulphur and some
other impurities but at that time no means were known
of reducing the phosphorus and the amount of this element
present in the product was due to the chance selection
of the ore there were no chemists in those days
to say whether the iron contained phosphorus or not and
practical experience with the product in use was the only
way of de lennining the merits of ores from various
sources it was soon discovered that wrought sorbed some of
that element and was thus con verted into cemented or
blister steel blister steel when piled welded and forged be
comes shear steel and if shear steel is piled welded
and forged the product is known as double shear by
this piling and welding cperadon the carbon wbicn is highest
in the outer portions of the cemented tor becomes more
uniformly distributed throughonc the mass of steel in 1781 bergman
of upsala pointed out that it was carbon which determines
the difference between wrought iron steei and the early steel
works were all located in the vicinity of great forests
for charcoal was tbe only fuel used the works were
also lo cated near running streams and water wheels were
umd to provide power for the blast and for the
first power hammers there are many such still in use
in sheffield in queen eliza beths dme the iron trde
had become so great that the wholesale destruction of forests
was stopped and the position and number of iron works
was limited by law as the result of this legislation
the iron trade languished until dud dudley in 1620 or
a little earlier success fully used coal in tbe blast
furnace in his day 20 tons a week was a
large output for a da v google steel etolutioh op
steeluaking processes mast furnace while today the output of one
of he blast furnaces at homestead is nearly 5000 tons
per week in primitive proltesses the workers look advantage of
natural draft and iocated their furnace on a windy hillside
later crude bellows were made from hidei and still later
a blowing arrangement operated by tlowing water was invented not
much real progress could be expected from such crude devices
and one of the first applications of the steam engine
of watt was running a blow ing engine at the
carron iron works in 1760 it was not until 1730
that it occurred to abra ham darby and his son
to real pit coal just as his charcoal burners treated
wood his idea needless to say was a good one
and coke was produced which in turn was soon successfully
used in the blast furnaces and is at the present
time the principal fuel used in blast tumace practice although
a few charcoal blast fur naces remain in america and
are quite com mon in sweden the next great advance
tn the metallurgy of iron was that of robert hunts
of sheffield who first pnoduced crucible the present time see
steel manuac tube of crucible the next great inventions which
made for progress in the iron industry were those of
heniy cort b 1740 d 1800 who first made use
of grooved rolls in 1784 and in 1785 pro duced
the dry puddling process the invention of puddling was without
doubt the foundation of great britains commercial greatness during the
century that followed prior to this time cast iron had
been decarbonized in small hearths very wasteful of fuel and
labor in which only 100 pounds could be treated at
a lime cort employed the reverberatory type of furnace in
which the metal was not in contact with the fuel
but was heated by the flame which was caused to
reverberate or beat down am aware steel was never melted
and cast after its production indeed by the foundinfr and
casting of steel after its production its heterogeneousness is remedied
and ingots of the metal can be produced perfectly homo
geneous throurhout and for the practical solu tion of this
problem we are indebted to robert huntsman of sheffield huntsman
was by trade a clockmaker and no doubt had his
troubles in attempting to make springs from the crude steel
which was avail able in his time it was to
overcome this dif ficulty diat he began experiments with a
view to melting the cemented or blister bar of his
day to obtain a homogeneous product a grandfathers clock the
pendulum rod and spring of which are supposed to have
been made from the first cast steel produced ty huntsman
is still shown in sheffield huntsmans chief difficulty in his
investigations was to find the right kind of clay for
making crucibles which would stand the intense heat of steel
melting his first crucibles were only 10 inches high atid
held about 20 pounds of steel steel made by this
process was of course expensive and could only be used
for edge tools dies and drills for which a reat
degree of hardness and fine polish was desired the original
business started by robert huntsman is stiji conducted from the
roof of the furnace this process permitted the use of
coal instead of charcoal and allowed the ube of 250
to soopound charges the story of corts life is a
very sad one for through a dishonest partner who died
suddenly his patents were seized to satisfy this partners liabilities
and cort died in poverty in 1800 prominent treasury officials
were impli cated in this unjust treatment of cort quite
recently americans have erected a bronze tablet to his memon
in the little church in hamp stead in the cnurchvard
of which his grave was the invention of the hot
blast by j b neil son of glasgow in 1828
afforded the next great advance in the metallurgy of iron
in six months the fuel consumption per ton of product
was reduced from somewhat over eight tons lo a little
over five tons the blast being heated to 300 f
a few years later the blast was healed to 600
f and the fuel consumption dropped from five and oncsixth
lo two and onefourlh tons at the same time there
was a great in output as well r the oroduction
oi me and 1840 while the use ot the hot
blast became a general practice during that period as was
the case with con so neilson reaped almost no reward
for his invention although the wealth it conferred upon iron
manufacturers could hardly be reckoned the same was true of
heath who in 1840 patented the use of man ganese
in steel this conferred an incalculable benefit upon the manufacturers
but heath died unrewarded after 15 years of litigation it
was not until 20 years after the discovery of the
ialuc of the hot blast that sir william siemens introduced
the system of regenerative gas firing a system in which
the waste prod ucts of combustion are employed to heat
the incoming gas and air of a gss furnace or
the blast of a blast furnace the application of this
principle of regenerative heating in the cowper and whitwell stoves
effected a still further great saving in fuel in the
blast fur nace and at the same time increased the
yield during more than onehalf of the last cen tury
wrought and cast iron were the only ma tenals available
for structural and machine con struction boilers enpnes etc crucible
steel owing to its high cost could not be used
for any of these purposes such was the situation when
henry bessemer gave lo the world his wonderful invention tliis
was the real be ginning of the modern age of
steel in which we live prior to bessemers invention there
iseveiy reason to beheve thai william kelly an american was
working upon what may fie called the pneumatic process according
to a recent magazine writer kelly was experi menting with
this process fully 10 years before the date of bessemers
invention and had built seven stationary converters prior to i8s6
his claim of priority of invention was allowed by the
united stales patent office nevertheless the process is universally known
today as the bessemer process and indeed there can be
little doubt but that bessemer made an independent discovery of
the pneumatic process robert hunt and james m swank both
agree thai for priority of invention william kelly deserves all
praise see steel the btsseiia pmcfss v google steel evolution
of stseluaklna pkoctissbs wi although ihe first iron furnace in
america was built in 1619 in virginia and the first
blast furnace with forced blast dates from 1714 nevertheless the
iron and steel business did not assume a large magnitude
in the united states until the building of the edgar
thompson fur naces in pittsburgh the first of which wamps
blown in in s7j in these furnaces american skill showed
the world how to triple the weekly output and to
cut the fuel cost in two that is while the
best english and scotch furnaces in 1880 produced from 400
to 800 tons al pig iron per week and reguired
two tons of coke for one ion of pig the
edgar thompson furnaces between isso and 1885 produced from 2000
to 2500 tons per week and used only one too
of coke to one ton of pig the coke in
some cases fell as low as 1882 pounds per ton
of output the ore used contained about 62 per cent
of iron and the volume of air reached 25000 cubic
feet per minute at a temperature of 1000 to iioo
f while we thus see that the modern steel industry
is of such recent date yet the inven tions of
the processes now used mainly viz the bessemer 1856 and
openhearth 1861 for making steel were relatively of long standing
and the gradual improvements in the processes themselves their mechanical
details and costs and the gradual education of the large
users of metals to employ steel in place of wrought
iron and cast iron gradually led up to the enormous
demands of the last 30 years to which the american
manifacturers have re sponded so energetically henry bessemer was of
a distinctly in ventive turn of mind and had many
useful in ventions to his credit before he turned his
at tention to steelmaking he gave considerable attention to the
manufacture of projectiles during the crimean war the cast iron
can non of this time were seen to be imsuitable
for bessemers powerful projectiles and be therefore set aigtoue producing
not only ihe pro jectiles but a better material for
making large guns after many trials and discouragements he succeeded
in producing steel from cast iron by blowing air through
it to oxidize the im purities his first experiments were
performed in a crucible and this being successful his next
idea was to use several crucibles fed by a com
mon air pipe later he adopted a lar sta tionary
converter about three feet in diameter and seven feet hi
and used 700pound charges the results were most astonishing or
bessemer found that by the simple method of blowing air
into fluid cast iron that the highest temperature then known
in the arts was eloduced the first formal announcement of
is invention was made at the british asso ciation for
the advancement of science in 1856 the title of his
paper being the manu facture of malleable iron and steel
without fuel great excitement followed the reading of this paper
and the process was tried in many parts of england
but in many cases the results were anything but satisfactory
the steel produced was red short and cold short the
cause of the trouble was soon found to lie in
the use of very impure pig irons running high in
sulphur and phosphorus the 6rst converters were lined with aad
or silicious materials and little or no sulphnr or phos
lorus was eliminated as long ago as 1856 dr collyer
writing of the effects of phosphorus and sulphur said the
former 1 consider most pernicious of all i would suggest
with due deference that a stream of finely pulver ized
anhvdrate of lime be forced at a given time with
the compressed air into the incan descent mass of iron
the lime having a great affinity for silica and phosphorus
would form a silicate and phosphate of lime and be
thrown off with the slag by this contrivance i can
not conceive but thai the phosphorus would be entirely got
rid of here we see the basic bessemer process clearly
anticipated many years before it was actually successfully worked out
and adopted 1871 the irregularity men tioned above was overcome
by the use of se lected pig irons low in
sulphur and phosphorus and by the important discovery of robert
mushct viz the addition of manganese to the metal in
the ladle after the blow the steel in the converter
after the blow is dead soft being nearly carbonless and
contains a good deal of dissolved oxide of iron beside
rather high sulphur and phosphorus the addition of speigeleisen or
fcrromanganese corrects all of these troubles it adds a certain
amount of carbon to the steel thereby increasing its strength
and hardness it deoxidizes the over blown metal and the
residual manganese com bines chemically with phosphorus and sulphur some
of ihe sulphide and phosphide being eliminated in the slar
and the rest being ren dered relatively harmless by reason
of its cora bininf directly vrith the manganese after these
chemical difficulties with the process had been overcome bessemer and
others turned their at tention to the mechanical side of
the question and produced the converter mounted on an axis
so that the vessel could be rotated or tipped down
and the airinlets or tuyeres could be thus broihl either
above or below the surface of the metal in the
converter this improve ment rendered the charging or discharging of
the metal much easier bessemer was more fortu nate than
all the other inventors previously mentioned in that he tiiade
a vast fortune out of lus invention as a matter
of fact his in vention was so complete in every
way that the process stands today exactly as he originated
it excepting for minor details somewhat less than half of
all the steel now produced is made in the bessemer
converters what the inven tion of bessemer steel meant to
the world will be seen from a few illustrations steel
boiler plates were first used in 1860 and because of
their much greater strength permitted of steam pressure up to
80 pounds being used this was a great advance in
boiler matung three years later locomotive boilers were made of
sleel but the greatest applica tions by far for steel
were for steel rails and steel ships the first steel
rails were made in the year bessemer steel was first
described to the public they lasted six years in a
place where iron rails had to be replaced every three
months from that day to this the great bulk of
steel rails has been made by the bessemer process in
1863 two small barges were built of steel and a
year later a steel vessel of 1250 tons was built
basic behetnr many investigators tried to solve the prouem of
removing phosphorus dgt google ampu dtfiel ttvdlutlbtf 6p ampteiblmakln6 pltotbssks
in the bessemer blow but it was not until the
early tffs that mr sidney thomas came to the conclusion
that its nonremoval waj due to the presence of a
stronly add slag and obviously a basic slag could not
be maintained in an add lined vessel after many failures
thomas and his cousin mr gilchrist discovered that a lin
ing of lime or dolomite could be made for the
converter using silicate of soda or clay as a binding
material and that additions of lime during the blow fadlitaied
the removal of phosphorus and that an afterblow was necessary
open hearth the next great advance in the metallurgy of
steel was the development of the openhearth process see steei
open hearth mantjracture tne prior discovery which led up to
the openhearth process was the invention of the regenerative furnace
by sir w siemens william siemens a german tiy birth
had both a technical school and university edu cation his
first visit to england was tn 1843 for the purpose
of introduang a process of electroplating by means of which
silver was deposited with a bright smooth surface rather than
in the form of a crystalline deport the following year
1844 he returned again to eng land ana reded during
the 40 more years of his useful life siemens profoundly
impressed by the theory of the conservation of energy and
with joule s determination of the mechanical equiva lent of
heat was ultimately led to the great discoverj of the
regenerative gas furnace then siemens invented his gas producer and
with economical gas fuel the regenerative gas furnace was a
great success the first furnace on a commerdal scale was
nsed for glass melt ing in 1861 and a little
later it was used for zinc distillation heating and puddling
furnaces and for melting crucible steel in this latter application
it is used exclusively in america while in england coke
fires are still used for melting crucible steel these are
very wasteful of fuel and possess not one single advantage
over the siemens producer and regenerative gas crudble melting lumace
siemens was not very successful in applying his invention to
steel melting on the hearth of the furnace itself and
it was several years be fore any degree of success
was attained in eng land but meanwhile messrs p and
e martin in france taking siemens own drawings erected a
furnace in france and overcame the obstacles that had almost
proved too much for siemens thus originated the si emens
martin process as it is universally known abroad while in
america it is usually merely desig nated as the openhearth
process martin produced his steel from wrought iron scrap dissolved
in cast iron on the hearth of siemens furnace with
the necessary recar bonization at the end of the process
and the addition of manganese this method is known as
the vs gtd scrap method sinens mean time was working
on a method now known as the pig and ore
method in which pi iron is decarbonized by the addition
of ore while scrap may or may not be nsed
it was not until 1868 that the openhearth process became
an assured was the first to be employed in fact
add bessemer and acid openhearth steel both antedate the basic
bessemer thomas and gilchrist who perfected the basic bessemer process
also realized that the essential change necessary to dephosphorize was
to substitute a basic lined furnace for the add lining
which had been previously used and the maintenance of a
basic slag during the operation by the use thomas announced
the success of his ex kriments in 1878 before the
iron and steel stiiule and although he announced that he
had succeeded in removing from 20 to 999 per cent
of the phosphorus from iron in the con verter and
thus rendered available for steel making mountains of ore the
world over wbidi without depfaosphorization were useless his an nouncement
attracted little attention but before many years england was besieged
with ger man french american and other metallurgists anxious to
learn about the epochmaking dis covery the basic steel process
germany profited particularly because of the large quan tities of
phosphoric ores which thus became a valuable asset in favor
of the bessemer process we may say that when steel
of from 06 to 10 per cent phosphorus is wanted
it is a cheaper 6ocess than openhearth but low phosphorus
essemcr requires a very careful selection of raw materials phosphorus
and sulphur must be lower in the raw materials than
is desired in the sted a disadvantage of the bessemer
process is that the sleet cannot be tested dur ing
the operation bessemer plants are suitable where tremendous tonnages of
a rather cheap product are required itie openhearth proc ess
gives a good outlet for steel scrap oillet ends old
rails etc the product is more re liable than bessemer
and the low phosphorus opcnheacth steels are much cheaper than
low phosphorus bessemer the process allows more latitude in the
selection of raw materials low or high sulphur pig can
be used and both irfiosphorus and sulphur can be reduced
the steel can be tested chemically and physically during the
operation and whereas in bessemer it is customary to continue
the blow until all the carbon of the jng is
oxidized in the open hearth process the decarbonization can be
checked when it has gone far enough or when the
carbon desired in the product is reached as regards the
quality of steels made by the various methods it is
undoubtedly true that even when the analyses are almost identical
that crudble steel takes first place next in order comes
openhearth and last place falls to bessemer as regards excellence
of analy sis they usually stand in the same order
crucible being finest openhearth next and bessemer last add op
en hearth if the proper materials are used ie if
virtually a crucible mixture is melted in an add open
hearth furnace will be a most excellent ma terial but
as actually made add openhearth is usually very high in
sulphur and phosphorus and mutdi of it resembles a bessemer
analjrsis in general then basic openhearth takes next rank to
crudble because of its low phosphorus and sulphur contents in
general of two steels of identical analysis acid and basic
openhearth he former will diow much the d google ampful

250 pounds in basic the cfecct of sulphttr is very
small as rards uie tonnage production of steel we find
that die most remarkable increase is in openhearth steel in
1917 the increase production of openhearih steel over 19ff was
over 20q per cent and the total reached the impressive
figure of 341483 tons or three times the production of
10 years ago the toral production of openhearth and bessemer
steel in 18 was 5250000 tons while in 1w6 it
was about 23000000 and in 1916 42500000 tons in 1896
25 per cent of all steel produced was openhearth and
75 per cent bessemer while in 1917 there was three
and onehalf times as much openhearth steel made as there
was bessemer one must not imagine from these figures that
the production of bessemer is decliniog materially the facts are
that bessemer pro duction is about at a standstill while
the train is in the making of openhearth steel the
basic openhearth process has made much more rapid gains than
the add in 1917 about onesixteenth of the openhearth steel
was of acid manufacture nevertheless that was the inggest year
by a considerable margin the country has ever had in
the manufacture of acid steel bessemer steel still holds its
own to a con siderable extent for rails althou open

is more largely usea than be add of the add

used m the form of castings rather than in the
manufacture of ingots for rolling electric processes which represent the
latest development in the steel industry are not an important
factor yet so far as tonnage is con cerned but
ihey have already outstnpped the production of crucible steel and
in fact in 1917 the production of electric steel was
more than double that of crucible the total production in
the united states of steel ingots and castings by all
processes in 1917 exceeded 45000000 gross tons which is almost
exactly double the production of 10 p 417 1906 campbell

syracuse steel heat treatment of the physical structure of steel
may and does vary to a marked degree according to
the heat treatment that it has undergone and that the
strength toughness and general usefulness of a struc tural member
of steel may be largely controlled l the way in
which it is subjected to the action of heat formerly
it was assumed that phos phorus gives brittleness that sulphur
makes the metal redshort and that the other properties are
almost entirely dependent upon the per centage of carbon present
with the introduc tion of the microscope and modern methods
of metallography in the study of steel and other alloys
it has been found that the structure and the properties
of the material may be largely modified without any change
whatever in the chemical composition and as a conse siuence
some very practical lessons have been earned when steel of
a coarse structure but not necessarily brittle is heated to
a certain teinperature and is then allowed to cool in
air or is quenched in oil or in water the
original structure is destroyed and is replaced by one of
a veiy finegrained character pure iron when so coarsely crystalline
as to resemble cast zinc may be restored to excellent
qualities by simply heating it to a certain temperature known
as the critical point its subsequent strndure resembling that which
it possessed when it originally left the rolls the old
idea of the process of annealing was to reheat the
material to a hi temperatnre and then to hold it
for a time at that temperature and subsequently to cause
it to cool very slowly but later researches showed that
the temperature of reheating must not exceed 1650 f and
that the time of cooling has little or no influence
upon the result it is altogether unnecessary to reheat and
re forge the spedmen and in fact the material is
apt to he still further injured by such a proc
ess since almost any piece of structural steel is liable
to be rendered more or less costallihe during the operations
throuf which it is neces sarily passed it is most
desirable that the proc ess of restoration be made a
regular portion of the routine of manufacture to permit this
it is only necessary that proper furnaces be de signee
to admit the large pieces and to permit a uniform
temperature to be maintained in all part reliable pvrometers being
of course pro vided so that the correct temperature may
be maintained the operation may then be per formed upon
every piece as the final stage in its manufacture the
result is elimination of daier of acddent from weakness by
crystalli zation the microscope indicates that heating at high temperatures

to about 1600 f for a very short time but
also that the steel may even be made better than
it was oriffinally it was long o noted that the
influence of thermal treatment increases rapidly with the carbon content
of steel in one of howes experiments with a muffle
the following varia tions were shown 0035 cutnn ontculidnuidesmn 1100c

higher carbon with less manmnese yielded less tensile strength than
the y car bon and 240 mn but a higher
elastic limit it will be noted that generally the best
result was obtained by cooling from 1100 c these experiments
were made in a closed muffle with both slow heating
and slow cooling the elastic limit reaches a minimum at
about 720 c then rises rapidly on heating to temperatures
of 750 to 8s0 and then decreases steadily the slower
the cooling the lower elastic limit is to be expected
in the matter of eloiation it has been found thai
with oso per cent of car bon as the initial
temperature for slow cod ing is raised the elongation decreases
moder ate up to 1200 or 1300 with her initial
temperature the elongation decreases rapidly in the matter of tensile
strength it is noted that the increase is more marked
when cooling is done in the open air than in
the muffle with rapid cooling hardness and brittleness increase without
much reference to the initial temperature of cooling so that
the steel maker always has to consider his product from
several different angles if the steel is low in carbon
it will be little affected by heat treatment but if
high in carbon the heat treat ment is all important
steel manufacture of cruci ble crucible steel is so called
because the ingredients from which it is made are melted
in crucibles or pots the name to clay is almost
syiionjtnous with tool steel meaning a steel contaiiuns at last
one half per cent of carbon icb will there fore
harden materially when plunged at a bright red heat into
water or oil steel of lower carbon than this may
be made in crucibles for especial purposes when hardness is
not the chief quality desired for example steel cast ings
are frequently made of crucible steel the quantity acttially so
used in this country is only a few uiousand ions
per anniuo the practice of hardening ttecl is of great
antiquity and is referred to hy the early roman and
greek writers the ancient egyptians heated iron in some cases
possibly of meteoric origin in the forge imtil by long
contact with the fuel it absorbed enou carboci to impart
considerable surface hardening when qnencbed the difference between oil ana
water hardening is referred to hy lucretius who says tbe
finest tools are tenpered in oil which gives a more
thirle hardness ihati aat imparted by water the faet that
iron heated in contact with carbon absorbs some of that
element whicb renders it harder seems to have been loiown
for many centuries and prior to huntsmans invention in 1740
all steel for tools was made by the process of
cementation especially in austria and england the art and industry
of converting pure wrout iron into cement or blisterbar flourished
by which as french says a steel was obtained which
had uncertain per centages of cartwn higher on the outside
than on the inside and varying in hardness from one
end to the odier according as the bar came in
contact in the converting fnmace with more or less of
the carburixing material or a higher or lower degree of
heat it was to overcome this lack of uniformity that
socalled single and doubieshear were made buthuntsman conceived the idea
of melting the cementedbar in crucibles thus rendering it absolutely
homo sneous and of uniform carbon contents roughout the mass
as first carried out the melted steel was allowed to
cool in the crucible which was then broken away and
the resulting mass was used as an ingot about a
century ago mushet patented the production of steel made in
the crucible by melting together soft bar iron and a
certain amount of carbonaceous matter this process did not amount
to much until 1839 when heath patented the use of
man knese as an essential addition to ctcible steel america
the mushetheath process of melt ing together in crucibles soft
bariron with or without a certain percentage of steel scrap
charcoal and oxide of manganese spiegeleisen or ferromannese is more
generally employed than the original huntsman process of meltiur cemented
or blisterbar it has been said of huntsmans invention that
the invention of caststeei was second in importance to no
pre vious event in the worlds history unless it may
have been the invention of printing hunts mans process was
rapidly adopted and at the time of his death there
were several firms melt ing steel and possibly soo individuals
and firms making files edgetools etc in sheffield famous for

steel works the materialb the base used for cruci ble
steel is usuallj wrought iron england ger many and america
draw on sweden for the more expensive grades and by
many it is be lieved that swedish materials possess some
mysterious virtues not afforded by other irons regardless of what
the results of chemical analysis ow the swedish irons are
all made from charcoal pik iron and are refined by
the lancashire or walloon processes some have claimed that these
irons contain traces of vana dium and that to this
they owe their virtue they usually contain small amounts of
manga nese while ordinary puddled irons are nearly free from
this element to the wnter this seems more important than
a possible trace of vanadium a careful investigation of products
made from swedish and american irons of the same analysis
has revealed absolutely no differ ence in the quality of
the product dicmtcally physically or by practical test in tools
of divers sorts certain it is that rarely does sheffield
tool steel show as great purity as regards sul phur
and phosphorus as is seen in the product of american
mills in america while swedish iron is still used to
some extent it has been replaced by selected open hearth
bar and by he purer product of the puddling furnace
this com monly carries less than onehundredth of 1 per
cent of sulphur and phosphorus and also contains much less
copper than the swedish in german and english toolsteels a
com bined percentage not exceeding 006 per cent of sulphur
phosphorus and copper is considered first class while in america
this combined per centage is about onehalf as much and
would not be expected to exceed 004 per cent in
the best product swedish bar or puddled bar may be
and is melted directly or it may be first carburiied
by the cementation process cemented bar is used more largely
abroad than in america for the purpose of adding carbon
when the cemented bar is not used it is customary
to use either a pure swedish charcoal pig iron or
the american product known as washedmelal both carry about 4
per cent carbon and are low in sulphur and phosphorus
but the former carries rather variable quantities of silicon and
manganese from which washed metal is nearly free this is
an advantage in favor of the swedish ig if the
silicon and manganese can be maintamed fairly uniform and not
excessive in amount in some cases all the carburizing in
the crucible charge is effected by mrans of charcoal small
quantities of oxide of man ganese or ferromanganese are usually
em ployed and for special steels metallic nickel manganese tungsten
chromium or molyb denum or their ferroalloys are employed crucibles
in england clay crucibles are almost exclusively used they arc
nearly al ways made in connection with he works using
them the mixing usually being done by men who tread
the clay with their bare feet little or no machinery
is used in their production the mixed ingredients are made
into baits of suitable weight and these are dropped into
a mold and a lug shaped like the inside of
a crucible is driven in forcing the clay up into
vlt 37 the mold and around the plug which is
then withdrawn and the crucible removed from iho mold and
dried for several weeks before using it is anneaied or
baked and is always filled while hot the crucibles last
only about three heats carrying 60 pounds at the first
heat and a less amount on each subsequent charge this
is because the metal attacks and weakens the crucible at
the slag line and hence the level of the metal
is lowered in the pot on each suc ceeding heat
graphite crucibles are general used in ger many austria and
the united states these according to analysis quoted by howe
may contain from 20 to 83 per cent of graphite
about 50 per cent being commonly used in america the
best ceylon graphite should be used arti ficial graphite made
in electrical furnaces is unsuitable for crucibles because of its
atltl lar rather than lamellar structure with the graphite is
used either clay or a mixture of clay and old
crucibles finely ground it is also cus tomary to use
a little coke dust in maklhr clay crucibles graphite crucibles
are much larger than clay ones and will carry the
customary 90 to 100pound charge from 5 to 10 heats
they will stand much abuse especially in the way of
sudden changes of temperature and need not be filled hot
each time indeed it is quite cus tomary to allow
them to cool oft completely between heats when they are
cleaned and in spected graphite crucibles cost from five to
eight times as much as clay crucibles but this disadvantage
is more than offset by their greater endurance and the
much greater produc tion per crucible the disadvantage frequently mentioned
that they impart variable amounts of carlon and silicon to
the steel is more fancied than real furnaces and fuel
several types of fur naces have been employed for crucible
steel melting but such slcel for tool purposes is nearly
always melted in shaft furnaces using coke as fuel or
in siemens regenerative fur naces using gaseous fuel either producer
or natural gus the latter is almost exclusively used in
the pitsburgh district and seems to be the ideal fuel
because of its uniformily of com position and its freedom
from sulphur in ad dition to these fuels anthracite has
been employed to a limited extent in a special form
of shaft furnace somewhat resembling the cokeholes or furnaces they
differ in this however that they require forced draft and
to provide this the ashpit is enclosed and air is
driven into it and thence through the bed of anthracite
on the grate by means of a fan blower waste
heat from anthracite furnaces may be used forheating steam boilers
petro leum has been used for fuel in the nobel
fur nace for jnelting crucible steel for castings as in
the mitis process we nov hear little of anthracite or
petroleum for crucible steel melt ing and the writer is
not aware that either of these fuels is actually being
used in america at the present time the sheffield cokeholes
or shaftmelting furnaces hold only two crucibles each and they
are not run at night the furnace itself con sists
of an oval chamber about three feet deep to the
grate bars and a foot and a half to two
feet in section these holes are arranged ground one or

the melting holes are connectecl either to sepa rate flues
some half dozen of them being united to fonn one

is roughly regulated by inserting bricks in the flues beneath

during the operation the coke must be replen ished at

regenerative s furnace which is used exclusively in the united
slates has never been popular in england although it is
much more economical as regards fuel consumption nu merous reasons
have been given to explain wby it is not used
in sherfield strangely enough it has been slated that gas
fires are not under such fcopd control as coke fires
or again that theeplire crucible and its contents are not
heated to a uniform temperature whatever weight these objections may
have it is interest ing to note that whenever english
capital has been invested in the crucible steel business in
america graphite crucibles and gasfired regen erative furnaces have been
adopted without apparent hesitation the american furnace consists of from
2 to 10 melting holes in a row and each
hole will accommodate six crucibles at a time each hole
is provided with three orts on eitfaer side through which
the gas and air and the products of their combustion
pass the direction of flow of the gas and air
is reversed about every is minutes in the way common
to all siemens regenerative furnaces beneath and at either side
of the melting holes are the regenerative chambers one for
gas and one for air on each side the chambers
are filled with socalled checker work of brick which takes
up heat from the outcoming gases or imparls it to
the entering gas and air the furnace of dawson robinson
and pope which is said to be giving vcxy sodd
results at jessop and sons sheffield differs from the american
furnace in that all fonr regenerative chambers are on the
same side of the melting holes which have four ports
eath the melting hole is curved or horse shoe shaped
on the side opposite the ports the gas and air
thus enter by two of the ports and rush around
the curved outer edge of the fur nace and down
the other two ports the six crucibles break and impede
the passage of the flame and absorb its heat as
it passes the melting holes have a layer of coke
from six to eight inches deep in the bottom and
on this rest the crucibles the crucibles are usu ally
filled carefully by hand while cold and are set into
the furnace the crucibles are well adapted to stand this
sudden change of tem perature if they have been well
baked and have gteegt kept in a dry place prior
to use unlike the coke furnace the gas furnace is
run con tinikntsly day and nit from monday morning to
saturday afternoon from 33 to 36 heats con stituting a
weeks work these furnaces will last from eieht months lo
a year or even longer before the roles need relining

scrap takes place in a rather un expected fashion the
inside seems to melt first and to run out leaving
a shell looking exactly like the original piece floating around
on top of the metal after the materials are clear
melted the heating is continued for an extra half hour
or more and this is known as the killing heat
if the metal were poured into ihe ingot molds immediately
after melting unsound and spongy ingots would result during the
killing some silicon is taken up from the walls of
the cru cible by the metal and this seems to
assist in making sound castings then also the oxide of
iron which is present in the metal has a chance
to react with the carbon in the steel or in
the walls of the pot and is thus reduced to
metal lic iron while oxides of carbon are formed and
eliminated steel that has been given sufficient killing if cast
in open molds and allowed to cool spontaneously would be
quite free from blow holes but would be deeply pipe
in actual practice means are employed to elimi nate the
pipe and the ingots are perfectly sound from top to

when of almost identical analysis crucible steel takes first rank
for quality with electric steel a very close second openhearth
steel stands third and to bessemer must be assigned last
place the exact reason why this is so is not
known definitely but the fact is generally admitted the quah
of crucible steel depends upon the nature of the raw
materials entering into the crucible mixture in general the lower
the percentages of sulphur and phosphorus the better the steel
and the higher the carbon the more pernicious is the

tungsten chromium molybdenum and other alloying metals interferes with or
precludes entirely the estimation of carbon by the eye other
elements being within the usual limits eg silicon and manganese
from 010 per cent to 02s per cent and sulphur
and phosphorus from 001 to 0025 per cent the percentage
of carbon is the most important factor in determining the
suitability of any steel for a given purpose according to
thallner steel containing upward of 15 per cent carbon may
be called very hard and is suit able for turning

knives for use on materials of medium hard ness also
for rock drills scrapers cutters etc medium hard steel of

075 per cent carbon is tough and suited to tools

rather a misnomer but the term is used in a
relative sense and applied to steel of about 065 per

of this kind can fit all cases in general the

the process of producing steel of this class derives its
name from the type of furnace used an open hearth
in european practice the process is known as the siemens
martin receiving its name because of bdng originated developed and
perfected by two eminent and early metallurgists 186467 the process
is conducted either in an add or basic furnace depending
upon the character of the raw material treated there are
several divisions of the process the original plan was to
treat a charge of all pigiron with the assistance of
iron ore to con vert into steel later a modification
was intro duced wherein pigiron and steel or wrought iron
scrap were melted together and subse quently refined to steel
the first named con stituted the siemens process and the
second the siemensmartin today the essentials of both processes remain
but modifications have been introduced from time to time the
monell process conducted in an open hearth furnace with a
basic lining consists of a charge of molten pigiron to
which certain quantities of iron ore and lime are added
which fuse to form a slag and which slag flows
out of the furnace at a point above the surface
of the molten metal thus carrying with it certain impurities
in the charge of metal it is desired to remove
the ore and lime are added at certain intervals to
make the overflow of slag continuous until the desired stage
of purification is reached nett in importance is the talbot
process also conduaed in a basic lined open beanh steel
d google s86 8tbel opsn hbasth mamuiacturb furnace the furnace
for this process is of movable type and is so
constructed that the body can be lilted forward to discharge
the bath of metal through an opening placed at the
level of the bath or it can be moved in
the opposite direction to pour out of suitable openings placed
at a higher mgtint greater or less quanti ties of
the slag the process is a continuous one a full
charge of metal about 200 tons which may consist of
molten pigiron direct from the blast furnace or a mixture
of pig iron and steel scrap is treated by additions
of iron ore and lime until proper p redetermined conditions
are reached by slag action at that stage the hulk
of the slag is poured o9 and about onethird of
the refined charge is with drawn into a ladle allowing
the balance to re main in the furnace the steel
in the ladle is recarburired and teemed into the ingot
molds and an additional charge of impure molten pigiron is
poured into the furnace in suffident quantity to bring the
contents up to the initial charge the remaining slag is
then removed by tilling the furnace a fresh slag made
by ore and lme and the refining operation repeated in
the second treatment however the interval of time is considerabh
reduced because the residue of refined metal from the initial
diarge greatly dilutes the succeeding addition of molten impure stock
and so making a smaller total of objectionable elements to
remove by sla action under normal conditions the furnace is
never empty excepting at week ends when incidental repairs are
made in siemens martin open hearth practice the furnace is
emptied com pletely at the end of each heat it
is then patched up as may be necessary and recharged
another process of recognized importance is the bertrandthiet process it
is used in eu rope to some extent two openhearth
furnaces are used one acid lined and another basic one
fumace may be placed at a higher level than the
other so that the charge treated in the upper furnace
can be tapped directly by gravity into the one below
or the furnaces may be placed at the same level
and the charge transference from one to the other b
e acc om plished by ladles in the hoesch modification
of uiis process only one furnace is employed the metal
being temporarily transferred to a ladle while the basic lining
is being spread when it is returned for final treatment
the principle of the process is that a charge of
impure stock is hrst treated in an acidlined fumace to
greatly lessen by nearly full re moval certain elements objectktnable
to further purification by the basic process by which the
metal is treated and fully refined in the sec ond
stage of the process it is a combined acid and
basic process whereby pigiron is con verted to steel and
allows the use of stock so high in phosphorus and
sulphur that it could not be successfully refined by either
process singly in the aadlined fumace the charge of molten

a high percent age of magnesia in furnace construction it
is ground and mixed with about 10 per cent of
anhydrous tar then rammed in and shaped to the sloping

the tar is carbonized into a solid cinder it can
also be mixed with pulverized basic slag which assists the
sintering and hardening effect a hearth of magnesite so formed
is practically inert under the action of a limey slag
but will fuse or cut if siliceous matter should be
present excessively the life of a magnesite hearth is practically
indefinite with a hearth of basic and refractory material such
as magnesite there is offered an oppor tunity to treat
3 charge of such stock carrying a hi content of
elements not removed in an add hearth namely pigiron with
100 per cent of phosphorus and 007 per cent of
sulphur is easily treated so that 9j per cent of
the phohorus and 75 per cent of the initial sul
phur can be removed by the action of the slag
consisting largely of lime and iron oxide the onlf element
that is objectionable is silicon and basic stock or raw
material is selected with amounts of silicon not exceeding 1
per cent to get a slagof the necessary dephosphorizing and
desulphurizing activity 10 to 15 per cent of the charge
is made up of limestone of a pure variety with
ore added from time to time sili con under the
oxidizing action of flame and additions of iron ore to
the bath of linuid metal will be converted to silica
and combine with the lime of the slag and if
excessive rob it of its power to absorb phosphorus and
sul phur the details of charging are the same as
in acid melting excepting that a charge is best made
up of 50 per cent of pig and 50 per
cent of scrap when scrap is used or the charge
may be all direct molten metal it is desirable to
use scrap moderately because it is easier to promote liquation
with a higher carbon content initially the layer of supernatant
slag is thick in a basic beat and more heat
units are required to penetrate it than an acid slag
for that reason the fuel consumption per ton is greater
in the basic process the flame manipulation is the same
as in acid melting as is also the carbon oxidization
by the action of iron ore the details of re
carburizing are followed as in acid practice during the progress
of the heat samples arc frequently taken which in addition
to bqirg studied for the carbon content are also tested
to determine how far the dephohoriiing ac tion has gone
the heat is not tapped until its removal is complete
or only a few thousandths of 1 per cent remain
there is some tendency on the part of the phosphorus
to revert to the metal after it has been tapped
into the ladle the amount given up by the slag
at that stage varies directly with the quantity of phos
phorus charged initially but with proper slag conditions and care
in stock selection the re absorption of phosphorus is not
excessive be ginning with pigiron carrying 1 per cent of
phosphorus and an equal amount of scrap with not more
than 01 per cent a heat of basic steel can
be produced to equal in analysis acid finished material when
the furnace is emptied after an op eration some unavoidable

sway but with the development of the basic process it
has lancely met the grow ing demand for steel castings
in spite of the fact that at first basic sicel
was more uncertain in its qualities for the production of
openhearth castings the details of construction and operation arc essentially
the same as for ingot practice the main differences are
that direct molten metal is not used the charges being
made up of cold raw maierial pigiron and scrap the
sizes of furnaces vary from 10 to 25 tons per
heal in the manufacture of steel castings prob lems are
encountered which are unknown in ingot practice it is comparatively
simple to pour liquid steel into such receptacles as ingot
molds but when pouring it into sand molds de sired
to cast shapes more or less intricate with various thicknesses
of metal greater or lesser length and irregularities of section
than is found in the plain columnar lines of ingots
the complexities become quite numerous it is necessary that the
steel be more fluid and hence hotter this condition is
secured by starting with a siliceous iron the common difficulties
encountered are lack of solidity liability of the castings to
crack or separate when cooling particularly in complicated designs where
there may be diiferenl rates of cooling in sections of
unequal thickness these difficulties are not insurmountable but their avoidance
calls for constant care and watchfulness and a high de
gree in skill in keeping conditions regular and uniform in
the furnace melting practice and also in the molding and
coring of designs for molding purposes a highgrade silica sand
is preferred one that is highly refractory and that will
not fuse at the temperature of liltuid steel about 1600
c an impure sand will slick to steel castings and
make rough unsightly surfaces the sand must he of such
a formation that there wilt he voids between the grains
to permit a free escape of ihc gases formed within
the mold when the hot steel is poured into it
silica sand is devoid of any bond and to allow
it to retain the form of the pattern after the
sand is rammed around it and the pattern withdrawn a
small amount of plastic fire clay is added to the
sand with a little water followed by thorough mixing to
furnish ihe necessary bond or stability to the moldtr mass
sometimes a mold is baked or i may be used
without any drying the first is known as dry sand
and the other a green sand practice when the mold
is filled with the liquid steel the molding mass under
the high tenqierature disintegrates or loosens and should allow a
free movement of the casting which contracts when cooling should
there be a resistance to such a movement in cooling
the casting will be liable to crack at points when
the resist ance and stresses are the greatest to promote
solidity in steel castings it is the practice to add
at the end of the refining and decarburiziiig operation certain
amounts of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese the former may carry from
10 to 50 per cent of silicon and the latter
usually about 80 per cent manganese the combined action of
the alloys is to thoroughly deoxidize the steel by uniting
with the dissolved oxides flux them so that they become
separated from the liquid steel and enter the slag on
top of the bath of metal and restore to the
steel the desired percentage at carbon were the oxides not
removed there would continue so long as ihe metal remained
liquid a reaction between them and the small quantity of
carbon always present in a bath of liquid steel so
that there would result a forma tion of gaseous carbon
without a stoppage of that action the metal if fractured
when cool would be found to be more or less
honeycombed an undesirable condition in any casting the value of
a steel casting physically con sidered depends upon its elasticity
toughness and ability to resist heavy duty the elasticity is
controlled by the carbon content of the fin ished casting
and that will vary with the re quirements of its
