ne ltelements of t also tunnels a succession succession is
the tnmsmis sion of property either real or personal at
the death of the owner by rules laid down by
law in distinction to that by will made by the
de ceased the term succession is used in law to
cover both the technical word descent which anplies to real
property and distribu tion wnich applies to personal property lhen
the owner of property dies it is pre sumed that
his property will follow in its suc cession the rules
laid down by law unless it is shown that a
will is in existence this fixes seat responsibility upon the
law to be just and ir to the survivors and
the statutes of the difierent states are very carefully worded
to cover the rights of all in all of the
states the statutes of descent and distribution show conclusively how
property will be disposed of by administers of estates the
statutes vary in some points but in most provisions they
fol low the old common jaw of england and the
roman civil law family ties form the base on which
are built up the laws of succession children of the
deceased known as the intestate from the fact of not
having made a will or testament regarding his property have
the first right in the property in the united states
except where modified by statute the heirs or persons who
inherit through the laws of succession take both the real
and personal property the only distinction being that the real
property vests at once and the personal is distributed by
children male and female share alike in the property of
the ancestor and if one or more of the children
is deceased the grandchildren will take that share that would
have fallen to their parent so long as one child
of the an cestor lives if there are no children
livirot and only grandchildren all the grandchildren will share and
share alike regardless of the ap portionment that would have
taken place if their parents had lived the former is
known as per stiqws or by representation the latwr as
per capita or by the number of persons property will
first descend in a direct line as long as uiere
are descendants such as to children granddiildren and their descendants
these are known as lineal descendants ll will then go
to brothers and sisters of the full blood and to
the half blood of the same father and thdr descendants
failing these de scendants it will ascend to the parents
and their descendants who are not in the direct line
with the intestate and are known as collateral de scendants
property will descend to even re mote kindred before it
will ascend one genera where there are no children the
husband or wife inherits in some states the entire estate
persona and real but in other states the per sonal
property only is inherited and the realty descends to the
blood of the intestate a life interest known as dower
only vesting in the widow the rirfits of the half
blood are settled by statute halfblood brothers and sisters inherit
from the common ancestor but not of the parent by
marriage where lineal descendants fail the succession is counted from
the common ancestor with the of purchase rather than by
descent rule is enforced in order that ancestral property shall
not be diverted from its original source in the united
stales there is no preference in descent for male rather
than female heirs nor for first bom if there are
not found any lineal descendants or any collateral descendants to
take the prop erty the succession fails and the property
re verts or escheats to the state or county adopted
children are treated as not capable of inheriting property other
than that of the adopting father and mother and are
not in cluaed in succession from other members of the
family either ancestors or brothers or sisters a child born
after the death of the father is included in the
inheritance as if the birth was before the death of
the father if the child is bom alive and the
share taken is the same as others of the children
a bastard may not inherit except from his mother or
illtimate brothers or sisters being illegitimate the law does not
rectniie rights due him if legitimized by special act of
legis lature or subsequent marriage he takes then in the

are wars which arise from claims for the possession of
the crown on the occasion of a sovereign dying without
undisputed legal heirs in modern european history the most important
of tlkse struggles were those of the spanish succession 170013
and of the auslrain succession 17408 wir of the spuiish
sncchiioil shortly before the death of charles 11 of spain
with out issue or callatenu male heirs several com petitors
laid claim to the throne the two principal being the
dauphin of france son of charles elder sister and the
emperor leopold who first claimed aa male representative of the
younger biandi of the house of austria be ing descended
from ferdinand second aon of philip and joanna of castile
though he after ward withdrew this claim and substituted an
other in right of his mother mary ann daugh ter
of philip iii of spain the other leading powers great
britain germany and holland were naturally deeply interested in the
settle ment of this question for the union of either
france gtor austria with spain which at that time ruled
over the netherlands the milanese naples and sicily and vast
territories in amer ica would have seriously endangered the bal
ance of power in europe after much nego tiation which
had little result louis xiv put forward his second grandson
philip of anjoil as the representative of the french claim
and leopold nominated his second son charles as his substitute
both parlies solemnly promising that spain ould never be incorporated
with their respective dominions charles of spains second consort mary
ann of neuburg being a sister of the empress naturally
promoted the views of leopold in which however she was
opposed by the count dhareourt a clever dip lomatist sent
hy louis to madrid and who conciliated many of the
nobles and grandees whom the queen hd alienated the french
ambassador also intimated a resort lo force if the rights

possessions of the spanish empire recognized the new monarch nor
was his title at first disputed by the greater part
of the european powers bui the meas ures of louis
excited suspicion and gave offense on the death of james
ii of england the french king recognized his son the
old pre tender as james iii the new works which
the french were constructing on the dutch fron tier alarmed
the statesgeneral and on 15 may 1702 england and holland
allied themselves with austria and declared war against louis xiv
and the usurper of spain the contest had however been
already opened by austria unaided prince eugene descended into the
plains of verona at the head of 25000 men about

elector of bavaria raised an army and endeavored to effect
a junction with villars who was sent by louis to
cooperate with him but they were both kept in rfieck
by the margrave of baden in 1703 marlborough whose actions
were hampered by the delegates of the states general confined
himself to reducing the strongholds held by the french in
the low countries in germany the elector of ba varia
drove the ansirogerman armies out of his dominions and formed
a junction with villars the latter advised a rapid march
npon vienna which might have then been easily captured but
the elector preferred to attack the tyrol where the french
general vcndome with half the army of italy was to
meet him the tyrotese however rose against the baa rians
and compelled the elector to retreat before vendome could join
him the elector again united his forces with those of
villars and in flicted a severe defeat on the imperialists
at hochstedt 20 september but many mis understandings arose between
the two com manders and villars in disgust obtained his
recall in the following year eugene and marl borough joined
their forces at donauworth or the danube and coming up
with the franco bavarian army under tatlard marsin and the
elector at blenheim inflicted upon it a seere defeat 13

prussia and the statesneral with assurances of friendstiip and goodwill
france returned an evasive answer charles albert elector of bavana
refused to acknowledge the queen of hungary tmtil his pretensions

to two ancient documents the marriage contract between albert v
duke of bavaria and anne daughter of the emperor ferdinand

contended that by these two deeds the succession was assured

having called together tfie foreign ministefs at her court caused
the testament to be read before them when it turned

the first blow against the young queen came not however
from any claimants of her in heritance but from a
sovereign who had ai res acknowledged her right this was

to the emperor as it compelled the austrians to return
from alsace and thus allowed time to recover his electorate
of bavaria the italian campaign of 1744 was unfavorable to
the aus trians in the preceding year they had driven
the spaniards almost to the neapolitan fron tiers and seemed
to threaten an invasion of naples itself to avert such

at very hi prices some others he was unable to
fulfil and paid a corresponding compensation by remii ting certain

of 30000000 it was opened only on 17 nov 18ls9
and the total cost was about 80000000 large numbers of
men were of course required for the works and crowds

engaged upon them while dredges and other machines at great
power were also employed to facili tate the constrtiction of

five deep was constructed for part of the distance by
which men and materials could easily be conveyed a canal
was also constructed for bringing fresh water from the nile
at bulak near ciro since with out an extensive supply

being the same many portions of the canal were easily
enough made but at other points the ex cavation demanded
an immense amount of labor in one place the workmen
had to cut a passage 90 feet deep and 200
wide through sandstone rock port said was chosen as the

whidi is confined between embankments and is from 26 to
29 feet deep much deeper than the lake beyond lake
menzaleh occurs a sandy strip of three or four miles
after which the canal enters lake ballah where embanking and
dredging had again to be resorted to passing through this
for about eight miles it next runs throu a land
portion of the same length in which occurs the formidable
cutting mentioned above and it then reaches lake timsah about
half way across the isthmus this is a small lake
and had long been drv but is now filled with
seawater and abouniu with fish lake llm sah is a

portsmouth by the union tioops 10 may 1862 a force
was pushed out to occupy suffolk 2s miles southwest of
portsmouth by the seaboard and roanoke railroad and at the
head of nansonond river fay wfaidi it had com mnnication
with the month of james river and also petersburg and
richmond by the norfolk and petersburg railroad it was not
only an important outpost to portsmouth and the key to
the mouth of james river but also the key to
all operations in the region bordering on the nansemond and
the dismal swamp and was a favorable point for operations
against be weldon and petersburg railroad the confed erates began
active measures to reoccupy the place late in august it
was held by general mansfield with about 6000 men and
six guns about half of the garrison was withdrawn early
in september and sent to the army of the potomac
and with them went mansfield tak ing advantage of the
reduction of the garrison the confederates began preparations to attack
the place and on 22 september gen j j peck
was placed in cotnmand with 9000 men under orders to
repel the advance from the black water of a reported
column of 15000 confed erates under generals french and peitigrew
on the 2sth peck began the construction of a system
of defenses encircling and covering the place which by the
end of january 1863 mounted 60 heavy guns early in
january 1863 the confederate authorities came to the con clusion
that peck was preparing a base of operations for a
grand movement on peters burg and richmond in cooperatioii with
the army of the potomac and began the construe tion
of a series of works from the line of die
blackwater to ron powhatan on james river general peck was
a vigilant officer and made frequent reconnaissances of the confed
erate positions along the litte of the blackwater bringing on
several collisions at frankkn znm and other pmnts during the
months of october november and december 1862 late in janu
ary 1863 general pryor who for some time had commanded
a confederate brigade on the black water crossed to the
east side of that stream on a foraging expedition he
liad three vir ginia regiments of about 100 men and
seven guns on 30 january gen m corcoran with a
regiment of cavalry five of infantry and 12 guns in

camp at kellys store nine miles west of suffolk artillery
was run forward and engaged that of ampe qnifederates for
nearly three hours when the infantry advanced and after a
short contest pryor fell back two miles to a strong
position from which he was forced and pursued as far
as carrsville corcoran re turned to suffolk the same night
with a loss of 23 killed 108 wounded and 12
missing pryors loss was 8 killed and 31 wounded general
lee informed that union troops were teing sent down the
potomac with the evident intention of operating against rich mond
by the south side of james river on 18 february
ordered general longstreet with two divisions of his corps to
petersburg and placed him in command of all confederate troops
south of james river including those in nordi caro lina
to defend petersburg and richmond late in february longstreet had
not inclnding those in north carolina about 24000 men 12000
of whom were on the line of the blackwater and
12000 near the railroad to petersburg so posted that within
24 hours he could concentrate them all near suffolk it
was left entirely to his dis cretion whether he should
assume the offensive but he saw the importance of confining
peck at suffolk and of collecting all the subsistence in
that section of the country and getting it inside the
confederate lines and longstreet began a very thorough system of

some will derive it fnom the vedanta and buddhism but
their theories have no real foundations and fall to the
ground when it is remembered that vedanta is pantheistic and
that sufism in the main follows the thdstic lines of
che koran some even refer to it as an offshoot
of chris tianity sufis themselves reckon it to be older
than its known historic forms and it seems 5mte probable
that there was sufism before the ufis as early as
the 2d century after the fligh asceticism and ethics and
with them sunstic quietism and the disinterested love of god
assumed a prominent position in islam and as fate would

word the inner meaning or doctrine which they read in
such a verse as the following which refers to the
battle at bedr thou didst not shoot when thou didst
shoot but allah shot minimizes individualism and makes the deity
all there is but in no wise alt essentially sufism
is an inner and personal experience or feeling of god
in diis respect it is as original as any other
mysticism but in its outward forms it has borrowed like
any other mysticism from its environment its im mediate cast
is mohammedan but its specula tive and doctrinal forms are
in the main drawn fnom parsed sm peripatetic philosophy and
neoplatonism from the first it draws a large part of
its rich symbolism the two htter were brought to it
by the seven greek philosophers whom justinians intolerance drove into
exile and who found a welcome refuge at the court
of nushirwan the sassanian king sufis do not like to
admit this but it is a fact sufism is primarily
not a doctrine but an experience a feeling when it
expresses it self intellectually it finds outlet in two principal
doctrines that of the one ahad and the tvay to
the ohc tariqat the first declares that there is not
only no god but god but that there is nothing
but god a teaching which excludes all pantheism inasmuch as
it never says that the all is god only that
god is the all and emphasizes that the world is
a phan tom an unreality the second doctrine the way
to the one contains the whole of the sufis ethics
and is practically the main burden of all sufi conversation
there are many methods or ways tariqat to union with
god they say the ways unto god arc as the
number lof souls of men but they all begin with
ascetic practices and end in a con templative beholding of
the divine most of them include the wellknown der vish
dances absolute silence for several years and other occult practices
sufism is rich in symbolism and some of it is
familiar to readers of hafiz and other persian sufi poets
a symbol is to a sufi rather more than an
emblem or a figure of speech it is what he
calls a veil that through and by its ma terial
form reveals the deity when hafiz and omar khayyam in
true sufi fashion glory in wine for instance they do
not glorify intoxica tion in any other sense than mat
in which it was used about spinoza namely that he
was full of god a godintoxicated man wine is to
them a form or manifestation of god as it is
in the sacrament to the christian when they sing its
praises their song is a hymn and spiritually they partake
in a mystery a sufi is not a drunkard nor
a licentious man the wine and women of the reveler
has no place in asceticism and the inner life that
sufi poets should use such strange language has always what
he says literally sufis lay more weight upon the conception
of god as the eternal beauty than most re ligious
and mystics god creates because he is beauty it being
the essential nature of beauty to reveal itself the act
of creation consisted in god throwing his reflection on the
mirror of notbeing and creation itself is thus only a
reflection a contingent bng man is the eye of creation
the point through which the divine looks out and the
cne who if he loves wisdom goodness and beauty can
overlap his individual limitations and attain union with god the
goal of sufism in addition to the already mentioned famous

from there it spread to cuba and adjacent islands it
was introduced into mexico in 1s20 braal in 1532 martinique

through south america the manufacture of sugar up to this
timt was very crude inefficient mills operated by wind water

to is feet in height and from one to two
inches in diameter it is made up of short sections
con nected by nodes or knots the spaces between the
nodes being termed internodes or joints the nodes have on
them a bud or eye and are made up largely
of non saccharine content while the internodes contain most of
the sur with prefer conditions of temperature moist ure and
soil the eye swells bursts and puts forth a young
cane which emerges from the soil with one leaf being

in a few the leaves grow to a length of
about three feet two inches wide at the base and
taper grace fully to a point when only a few
weeks old the plant will begin to exhibit nodes and

the stalk bare while the upper portion continues green succulent
and grow ing until killed by frost or arrested by
maturity when it flowers and seeds it is onlv in
tropi cal countries that cane flowers and the time required
for this is from 12 to 15 months propagation sugarcane
is a perennial plant and can be propagated by layers
the entire cane may be planted but the upper portion
is thought best for seed in many countries this portion
is used for seed but in louisiana and adjacent states
the tops are thrown away except a small igtortion fed
to stock during harvesting the lotiisiana planter claims that labor
is too scarce at harvest time to take care of
this part of the crop which would by taking off
the partiallymatured joints be ample for seed the cane is
cut near the surface of the ground leaving a stubble
or ratoon which sprouts in the spring and is capable
of producing a second and even a third crop in
louisiana and in tropical countries s to 111 crops can
be grown with but one planting though the general practice
where cane and labor are abundant is to plant annually
or bi ennially the tendency of the young canes is
to sucker and a large portion ot the crop may
come from suckering especially if the stand is poor the
crop from the pt cane is larger than that from
stubble in louisiana but the re verse is true for
two or three years in the tropics and each successive
stubble crcgt is less than the preceding the stubble cane
is richer in sugar and has more fibre than plant
cane and is not considered as good for seed as
the latter soil ita prcparationi cultivation sugar cane is grown
more or less in all tropical and semitropical climates and
the soil in which it can be grown may be
of vety varying char r a suitable soil should be
very fertile and with enough clay in the subsoit to
prevent leaching of the soluble constituents at the same time
it should be well drained cane grows well in the
southern states georgia florida ala bama mississippi louisiana and texas
in both sand loam and clay loam soil but the
alluvial soils of the valley lands are best adapted foi
growing cane the preparation of the soil is a very
inortant feature of cane culture if the land should be
at all stiff or very clayey proaration should take place
or hefpn in the fall the lighter soils of a
porous or loose character may be prepared just before planting
it is customary in this country in preparing the soil
to throw it up in ridges five to seven feet
apart and when this is done in late sum mer
or in the fall with a targe quantity of vegetable
matter whether of grasses or pea vines the soil is
in fine condition for planting in early spriiu in rotation
of crops corn ana peas usually follow cane planting the
planting of the cane con sists in evening the ridges
and putting the cane into a deep furrow and then
covering with a plow sometimes rolhng after covering one two
or three canes may be planted along side by side
in louisiana or other southern states growing cane but in
the tropics short pieces may be planted it is the
custom of some to cut the cane in lengths of
is to 24 inches be fore planting while others cut
it only where it is crooked the object being to
make it lie well in the furrow recent experiments in
hawaii have shown cutting to be of great value in
securing a good stand in some countries only the upper
portion of the cane is planted for reasons already given
the quantity required per acre varies from four to six
tons thus requiring a large investment in seed cane on
a large plantation preterving seed the seedcane is pre served
through winter by windrowing or mat ling the former being
more generally prac tised windrowing consists in cutting and pil
ing the cane in a continuous row hetween the rioges
in such a manner that the tops and leaves cover
up the butts of the cane after which dirt is
thrown over sufficient to cover the cane or partially cover
it matting differs from windrowing chiefly in having trash or
grass thrown over the cane before it is covered cane

fertiliiation of the dy google suoar growing and suoas making
cane is very important as one fertilizer m tend to
grow a heavy tonnage with smalt sac charine content while
another may grow less tonnage bat proportionately more sugar the
fertility of the soil is maintained by the addi tion
qj commercial fertilizers distributed either iu drill or broadcast by
rotation of crops and by growiiik heavy crops of pea
vines cultivation the cultivation should be n as soon as
the cane is well up and has for its object
the destruction of weeds and grass and maintenance of good
tilth frequent mov ing of the soil to a very
shallow dth is ad vantageous while deep plowing is very
in jurious it is necessary to hoe the cane from
one to three times the cane is usually laid by
in this country in the latter part of june or
the first of july and the implenient used for this
final work is the disc plow which throws the soil
well up around the roots of the cane leaving it
on a high ridge the chief purpose of which is
to aid in drainage drabaage the drainage of the valley
lands in louisiana is very important and ex pensive the
land is cut into small pieces vary ing from two
to five acres with a system of mains and laterals
to take o9 ae excess of irriptioil irrigation should be
practised if possible this is essential in some of the
islands of hawaii the water is applied by allowing it
to run in the furrows irrigation is practised very little
in louisiana harvesting cane has about eight months to produce
sugar in this country while in hawaii cuba and other
tropical countries its growth may extend over one year or
18 months before heing harvested the harvesting period in this
countiy is from october to january in those from january
to midsummer cane is usually cut by hand though canecutting
ma chines have been in operation of recent years these
however have not been perfectly saris factory the instrument used
for cutting cane is a large steel knife with a
blade abont five inches wide 18 long jnd provided with
a lit tle hook on the back the cane is
cut at or near the surface of the ground the
leaves stripped off with the hook the top cut off
at the last matured joint and the cane put into
piles along the rows from here it is taken up
either by hand or machinery put into carts and laid
across iarge ropes or put into cars and transported to
the factory here the cane is taken out by hand
or machinery and if the tatter it is accomplished by
a derrick wbidi lifts the entire load by means of
the rope on which the cane has been laid these
large bundles are piled up around the factory and when
the cane is to be crushed it is taken un
by the same machine elevated to an incline dropped on
it and slides down to the cane carrier and thence
to the mill extraction there are in practice two methods
of extracting the sugar from cane namely milling and diffusion
the older and generally used is milling the diffus r
three rollers usually placed horizontally and vary in length from
18 mches to 72 intiies and in diameter from 12
to 32 inches if the mill is to be operated
by oxen or by horses the rollers are set in
an uurigfal position the most primitive mill was the wooden
roller this has been used in a small way in
some of the southern states since the gvil war but
there is at this writing perhaps not one in existence
in this country in most large factories there are two
of these threeroller mills and in some three the rollers
are so arranged that two are placed on a level
and geared to move in die same direction irfiile the
third moves in the opposite direction if a factory operates
two mills the rollers of the first are further apart
than those of the second and if three mills the
third has its rollers closer together than the second these
rollers revolve very slowly one and onehalf to two and
onehalf revolu tions per minute and are operated under great
hydraulic pressure to relieve the strain upon the mill a
cane crusher or shredder has come into general use the
cane enters one of these as it leaves the cane
carrier and is either crushed or redded into small pieces
before reaching the mill this not only relieves the mill
of the work of crushing the whole cane but increases
its capacity the capacity of mills will vary from 200
to 1400 tons of cane per day and the extraction
is 70 to 80 per cent on the weight of
cane and 90 to 95 per cent of the sugar
in the cane between the first and second mill the
juice receives a spray through a perforated pipe of either
hot or cold water the object being to dilute the
sugar so a larger percentage will be crushed out 1
the second mill this addition of water is termed maceration
and the quantity of water added may vary from 5
to 15 per cent of the weight of the cane
and in some cases as much as 3 per cent
the quantity depending somewhat upon the value of fuel and
the capacity of the evaporating outfit in some instances the
di luted juice from the third mill is returned and
used lor macerating the crushed cane between the first and
second mill and water is used between the second and
third the value of maceration may be seen from the
following estimate taken from practice it has been esti mated
tiiat maceration increases the extraction from four to six pounds
of sugar per ton of cane a factory crushing soo
tons daily and operating for 90 days would crush a
total of 45000 tons an increase of live pounds per
ton would yield to this factory 225000 pounds of suar
this quantity ai 35 cents per pound the price paid
for 96 test last season in louisiana would amount to
7825 supposing that 10 per cent of water on wdght
of cane was used then for every ton of cane
there would have been 200 pounds of water or approximately
25 gal lons it is estimated that one pound of
coal will evaporate about eight pounds or one gal lon
of water then the 25 gallons of water would require
25 pounds of coal coal being valued at 4 per
ton or 20 cents per 100 pounds 25 pounds would
be worth five cents this de ducted from 175 cents
the value of five pounds of sugar leaves 125 cents
as the net value gained per ton of cane and
the 45000 tons ttculd be worth 5625 diffuaion extraction by
diffusion is treated under beet sugar and it is necessary
here to give only a brief statement with reference to
diffusion as applied to sugarcane diffusion has been practised at
several factories ia louiiiada google sugar growing and sugar making
t9t and some other couniries but it has not yet
met with very great favor the diffusion proc ess in
louisiana has been abandoned ihert arc claimed for diffusion the
advantages of a purer juice and a hier percentage of
extraciton in a battery used tor sugarcane the juice will
vary in sucrose from 3 per cent in the last
of a series of 12 to 14 cells to 16
per cent in one freshly filled the disadvan tages of
this process are large amount of water to evaporate more
skilled workmen required and the chips are not so good
fuel evtn after running through a press which causes ad
ditional expense the utilization of bagaue the cane after receiving
its final crushing whether passed through two or three mills
contains from 40 to 50 per cent of water and
is therefore a poor fuel if its value be estimated
on the weight of bagasse if allowed to accumulate it
would become a great nuisance about the foctory hence it
is consumed as fuel if the ash con tains silica
and alkalies in proportion to form a fusible mixture a
slag wilt result and choke the furnace by forming a
coating over the gratings for this reason the burning of
a mixture of bagasse and molasses has not been satisfactory
notwithstanding its high water content it supplies about twothirds of
the fuel in the louisiana sugar factory and practically all
of it in the tropical countries where the percentage of
ftbre is from 2 to 3 per cent more than
in this state six tons of wet bagasse or three
of waterfree are said to be equivalent to one ton
of ordinary bituminous coal ex periments at a very great
cost have been made to produce paper from bagasse at
sugar land tex and at kenil worth sugar factory in
louisiana neither has been a commercial suc cess though there
has been a considerable amount of rather an inferior grade
of brown paper from these mills put on the market
in this section the kenilworih mill cost about 300000 and
it is said that the running of it for one
year added to this amount 50000 to 60000 more this
mill is shut down and the bagasse from the last
crop was consumed as fuel the manager of this mill
claims that the percentage about 30 per cent according to
his estimate of paperproducing fibre is too small that the
color is poor and bleaching is too expensive and that
the paper is wanting in slrengtn the opinion of the
writer is that a fair test has not yet been
made clarification the juico as extracted by the mill has
a gray or dark green color an acid reaction and
contains sucrose glucose or dextrose perhaps a little levulose gums
albu men organic acid pectine the ash or mineral constituents
earthy and coloring matter fine particles of suspended bagasse etc
the fol lowing analyses show the composition of three samples
of java cane juice taken respectively from first second and
third mills in triple crushing these results indicate the composition
of cane juice in java and other tropical countries where
cane is grown under most favorable conditions in louisiana the
juice has from 10 to is per cent sucrose 1
to 25 per cent glucose or re ducing sugars and
the nonsugars vary from 1 to 3 per cent there
is usually a difference of 2 to 3 per c
to the end december and january of the grind ing
season the reducing and nonsugars also vary verjr much between
the opening and close of the grinding the purpose of
clarification is to remove the impurities as far as possible
this is accomplished by chemicals and heat causing the soluble
impurities to become in soluble or solid these are removed
by settling or filtration the principal chemicals are ul phur
lime and phosphoric acid sulphur is applied as sulphur dioxide
which bleaches dis infects coagulates some of the albumen and
prepares the juice for taking more lime thereby causing a
heavier precipitation which brings about a mechanical cleansing sulphur is
not much used in the tropical countries where the juice
is of a high degree of purity but it is
extensively used in louisiana and other sec tions where the
juice contains large portions of impurities lime is universally used
and is the most important of all the chemicals em
ployed in the sugar factory it neutralizes acids acts upon
the gums albuminous substances coloring matters and if added in
excess upon the glucose converting it into organic acids the
lime compounds uius formed are largely insoluble but some of
them are soluble the in soluble portion is removed by
settling or filtra tion and much of the soluble can
be got rid of by the addition of phosphoric acid
to form the insoluble tricalcium phosphate or in some cases
sodium carbonate to form the almost insoluble calciuip carbonate phosphoric
acid is also used to correct any alkalinity resulting from
excessive liming and sodium carbonate is very essential in properly
correcting the acidity of sour juices lime salts if left
in solution in any considerable quantity give trouble by depositing
on the coils of the effects and pans thereby reducing
their efficiency in the evaporation carbon dioxide is used to
correct alkalinity and remove excess of lime defecation to carnr
out the process of clarification the juice as it leaves
qie mill is strained through a copper wire gauze then
drawn into a sulphur box or tank if sulphur be
usedj whtre it is thoroughly mixed with sulphur dioxide which
is produced by the burning of sulphur in an appropriate
oven nearby from the sulphuring apparatus which may consist of
a box in whirfi the juice and sulphur gas are
mixed b a pump or of a cylinarical rotating and
inclined vessel in which the mixing takes place by rotation

heated before entering the clarifier in others it is heated
in them milk of lime prepared by slaking and grinding
in especially constructed machines is added in the clarifiers in
sufficient quantity to neutralize or leave slightly acid or slightly
alkaline according to the practice of the factory acid juices
being worked to pro duce highgrade sugar and alkaline or
neutral to produce low grades the necessary quantity of lime
requireo for a given quwitily of juice is not easily
determined several methods are in use for this purpose 1
by the addition of lime until it shows a desired
reaction with litmus or turmeric papers 2 by testing a
litre or gallon of the juice with milk of hme
and applying the same proportion in the clari fier 3
an approximate quantity is added the juice healed agitated a
small portion fil tered and tested with sucraie of lime
prepared by shaking powdered lime with a 20 per cent
sugar solution which forms a precipitate if an insufficient quanlity
has been added more lime is then added and the
sueraie test repeated this testing is repeated until the necessary
quantity is obtained prinsen geerligs 4 the acidity of the
juice is determined with a tenth normal caustic soda solution
using phenol hthatein as an indicator an approximate but insufficient
amount of lime according to the soda test is added
the juice heated agitated a small portion filtered and again
tested with the soda now the exact quantity indicated by
the soda may be put into the clarifier on heating
in some factories the settling takes place in the clarifiers
while in others the boiled juice is drawn on into
large cylindrical tanks provided with conicallyshaped bottoms iwhich facilitate settling
if the former method is used it is the practice
of some to brush off the scum of impurities into
a trough attached to the side of the clariher and
then allow other suspended particles to subside when the clear
liquid is drawn off through a twoway cock and led
into the evaporators or effects when all of the clear
juice has been drawn off and the mud be gins
to show up the clearjuice cock is closed and the
other one is opened and the residual juice with impurities
is conducted to a recep tacle provided for this quality
of the liquid the custom in other factories is to
heat the limed juice nearly to boiling about 95 c
shut off the heat and allow to stand until the
heavier particles of the precipitated matter col lect at the
bottom the clear portion of the liquid is then separated
as above stated when settling is to take place in
the settling tanks the juice is heated to boiling and
at once drawn into these tanks after complete settling the
clear liquid is drawn off in a manner similar to
that already described it is the custom in some factories
to filter throu heavy canvas bags orie folded within another
the entire volume of juice that is the partially clarified
juice the muddy portion being convted to fil ter presses
arranged with cloths that fit in be tween castiron plates
the juice is pumped into the filler press where these
cloths retain all the solid particles the juice defecated and
clarified as above described is sometimes defe cated a second
time but in a very similar man ner to that
already described lliis second de fecation may take ilace immediately
after fil tration or in some instances it is after
partial concentration or evaporation carbonation see beet sugar superheatink of
recent years there has been added to the ordinary defecating
process a superheatins apparatus generally known by the name of
the deming superheater it is claimed that the principle of
the deming system is in converting some of the soluble
into in soluble material at a temperature of from 110
to 115 c to apply this principle three ves sels
cylindrical in form are connected with each other by a
system of tubes two of these vessels being termed absorbers
and the other digester tie juice enters one of the
absorb ers and is pumped through it into the second
in these it is heated by exhaust steam and fasses
thence into the digester where it is ealed with live
steam o the high temperature above mentioned as it passes
out from the digester it is surrounded by an inflow
of the juice on its way to the absorbers which
heats it up to about 50 c the superheated juice
limed before being heated is conveyed to spe cially constructed
settling tanks that permit of a continuous inflow ana outflow
of juice the impurities being collected in the conical bot
tom of the settling tank this tank carries within it
a large cone the top part of which is on
a level with the top of the tank the bottom
part ending at the top of the conical portion of
the tank the cone both ends of which are open
is suspended within the tank the lower end of the
cone is of a very large diameter while the upper
end has a small diameter the principle of this contrivance
consists in a down ward current of juice from its
entrance into the tank and an upward flow through the
cone the particles of solid matter having a greater density
than the liquid and to go downward but the upward
current causes a portion of thera to rise diough in
their ascent they strike the sides of the cone and
are returned to the bot evaporation and crtstallizatiob the evaporation
of sugar solutions or cane juice has for its object
the concentration of the liquid to such a density as
will cause the sugar to crys tallize out to accomplish
this there are two methods the open kettle and the
vacuum pan the openkettle process consists in boiling the juices
m open pans either of circular or rect angular form
provided with steam coils the heat is continued until the
density indicates suf ficient cooking when a density of 22
to 36 baume is reached the liquid is termed a
syrup and when the syrup is cooked to a stiff
mass a masse cuite after allowing crystallization to take place
in wood or iron vats the masse cuite is thrown
into a hogshead and the mo lasses percolates through a
perforated bottom or the sugar and molasses may be separated
in a centrifugal machine the sugar thus made is termed
open kettle and the process is not used in the
uptodate factory the vacuum apparatus a domeshaped ves sel 5
to 10 feet in diameter 8 to 15 feet high
provided with steam coils is the most econond ca for
evaporating sugar solutions requirii only about onethird the fuel of

or more pans connected or consist of one pan more
than three pans have not been found ad vantbreous these
vessels are so controlled that tne vacuum in the first

they are con nected with a system of valves so
that the juice dischatng of the pan is termed a

to a mixer provided with a shaft carrying paddles or
fingers that keep the sugar and acuiering molasses mixed the
well mixed masse cuite is next conveyed to a cen
trifugal machine made to revolve 1000 to 1200 limes per
minute and in its rapid motion the sugar and molasses
are separated the latter may b drawn from the first
to the second and from this to the thiril from
which it is drami into a syrup tank exhaust steam
is usualty uiilized for concentrating the iiiice though it beconks
necessary at times to use live steam the steam enters
the first and causes it to boil and the steam
generated in this is sufficient to boil the second and
so on the concentration is carried to a density of
22 to 26 baume or about 50 per cent water
the sjtup is drawn from the tyrup tank ino the
vacuum strike pan until one two or three coils are
covered and this deampnite quan tity is heated until grains
of sugar may be seen on withdrawing with a proof
slick a rample and spreading it on a piece of
glasi the for mation of grain is sometimes brought about
by permitting a little cold juice to enter the pan
and suddenly cool it the object here is to form
a crop of seed crystals and the re mainder of
the process has for its purpose the developing or growing
to a desired size this is accomplished by continuing the
boiling and adding from time to time small quantities of
the syrup taking care that no more grains or crystals
are formed in three to four hours the pan will
be as full as is convenient to cook it and
the sugar crystals as large as dedred if very large
crystals are wanted as is sometimes the case with confectioners
a cut strike is made that is onethird or half
the sugar in the pan is dropped out through the
bottom and the remaining portion say onehalf is built up
in the same manner as already described on cdmplefing the
boiling the second tinte there are nbt s6 many crystals

beet sugar hiatorlcal sugar was discovered in the ordinary beet
by margraft a member of the berlin academy of science
in 1747 but the sugar content was very small being
from 2 per cent to 4 per cent about half
a century later karl franz archard undertook the extmction of
sugar from the beet and his efforts were suc cessful
great interest in both germany and france followed his investigation
and by 1812 there were many factories established napo leon
added greatly to the progress of this in dustry by
government aid and by the establish ment of sugar schools
after the new industry had become well established it was
almost olgt lilerated by destructive wars it was revived however
soon in france and by 1829 a yield of 4000
tons of sugar was made but germanys inleresl was not
resumed until 183s from these countries the industry has spread
through out europe until the production for 1903 has been
variously estimated at 5000000 to 6500 000 long tons the
first experiments with sugarbeets in the united states were made
by two philadel hians in 1830 about 10 years later
david ce child northampton mass attempted beet culture and the
manufacture of beet sugar he produced 1300 pounds at a
cost of ii cents per pound these enterprises failed and
seem to have discouraged further efforts until gen nert brothers
natives of brunswicjc germany inaugurated a plant at chaisworth iii
in 1863 and this failed seven years laler attempt after
attempt failed and it may be said that this industry
was not permanently established until d google sugar growino and
sugar making between 187580 from this time sugar beet culture
has been successfully conducted in the united states and at
this writing there are 51 done with a hoe which
leaves a clump of beet plants abotit eight or nine
inches apart the thinning to a stand is then completed
by select ing the best looking plant from the bunch
left by the hoe and this plant is protected by
pladng it between the fingers with the back of the
hand down and the remainder of the small beets a
pater pm factories distributed over 13 states with a pro
duclion of about 208790 long tons for 1905 soil and
its preparation sugarbeets re quire a mean summer temperature of
about 70 ft and may therefore be grown in a
very ex tensive territory in the united states stretching from
new york to california but in this vast scope of
country designated the sugar belt there is much land that
will not grow beets profitably because the soil is not
adapted for such a pur pose while a eat variety
of soils may be suitable for growing beets the soil
best adapted for this purpose is a sandy loam with
a subsoil open so as to permit the beet to
send down a taproot and at the same time insure
enough loose soil for the beets to grow well under
ground otherwise the taproot will sprangle and the top of
the beet will show above ground both of which growths
are deleterious to the best results in order that the
beets may develop thor oughly the soil must be of
a loose friable char acter and thoroughly prepared before planting
the seed the preparation is best effected by plowing about
eight inches deep and following a subeoiler to the depth
of about seven inches and finally harrowing until all clods
are broken and the soil thoroughly pulverized if the land
should be lumpy the young plants will find great difficulty
in coming up and it will be very troublesome to
work or cultivate them thorou preparation usually destroys much weeds
and grass that otherwise would interfere with the cultivation of
the young beet planting the beet seed are about the
size of a small pea with a very small and
rough ex terior and should be put well under the
earth but not deep the seed are sown in ridges
or furrows in the level ground the latter being more
general from 14 to 18 inches apart the seed are
distributed with an implement termed a drill or seeder the
best time for planting is in the months of april
and may after planting a roller is pressed over the
seed to press 3ie soil close to them if the
rouing should make the surface too smooth and hard another
implement is passed over the ground to roughen it up
because the wind sweeps over the fields and causes the
sand to do damage to the young plants when the
surface is without obstructions some plant seed in rows at
right ancles to the wind in order to avoid injury
by it thinninj as soon as the young plants are
well up or show tour leaves thinning is begun this
consists of first bunching and then thinning to the proper
number of plants to be cultivated for the crop the
thinning is per formed by hand the first part of
the work is become entangled widi each other cultivation the
cultivation of the beet is very expensive inasmuch as a
large portion of the work moit be done by hand
though of late improved agricultural implements have reduced the expenses
the beet should be worked in some way or other
if possible every week with a view of preserving good
tilth the chief object being to destrov weeds and grass
and conserve the moisture by forming a loose layer of
soil on the surface which closes the capil lary tubes
in the soil throu which the water evaporates beets should
be hoed two or three times depending upon the weeds
and grass this hoeing is partly done by a plow
but the chief part of it must be done by
hand the cultivation period usually extends over six or seven
months harveatinfc the harvesting is bun in different sections of
the country at different periods depending upon the climatic conditions
in some portions of cahfornia harvesting may begin in august
while in sections where the temperature is not so favorable
it is begun in september and october the harvesting extends
from two to four months the beets usually indicate when
they are ripe by the leaves turn ing yellow and
drooping to the ground the first step taken in harvesting
consists in run ning an implement down underneath the beets
so as to cut the taproot where it is small
and at the same time loosen the earth around the
beet so it may be readily pulled up by hand
the beet is then taken up by hand and with
a special knife the top or neckj as it is
termed is removed by one stroke the top is cut
off where the leaves begin to grow on the beet
or just below this point it has been found by
experience that the top of the beet is very ridi
in nonsugars and that it is better to remove these
to prevent their contamination in the process of manufacture the
beets are thrown in piles and if they are to
be sent to the factory immediately they are not covered
up but where the beets are to be preserved some
time they are put into piles of three to four
feet in diameter and covered with a layer of earth
varying in thickness from six to 24 inches this latter
process is termed siloing and the beets thus preserved remain
in a silo until the factory is ready for them
the beets are taken to the factory in carts in
which are placed nets so arranged that they may be
removed by ma chinery carrying wiu them the entire load
of beets or the beets may be thrown directly into
the cart and at the factory the cart is driven
upon an elevated platform and the beets dumped out ttie
beels are next thrown into a large lank filled with
water having a shaft pro vided with fingers so that
during the process of washing the beets are kept continually
agi tated and brought near where fresh water is flowing
into the tank in this way all of the adhering
soil is removed d google mkvafi okowimo mtti svqatt litaklnd
fram the wrdtins tanks the beets are taken by an
elevator and tarried above the difluaion battery and dropped into
a slicing machine where tbcy are cut into very thm
narrow pieces so that when the chips fall theywill not
ue too compactly one upon ihe other the chips are
conveyed from the slicing machine to a hop per with
a funnelshaped tube and so arranged that it may be
rotated or moved otherwise to fill the cells of a
battery arranged in a drcle or in line the battery
consists usually of from 12 to 14 castiron cylindrical cells
connected with each other by a system of pipes with
cocks between so that one may empty and fill without
interfering with the operation of the rest the extraction of
the sugar consists in washing the chipped beets with hot
water so as to remove the sur the battery is
so operated that the water is admitted into the cell
the chips of which have been most nearly exhausted and
passes out at the cell last filled in this way
the water is made to do its maximum work when
the beets have been exhausted of the sugar the bottom
of the cell is opened and the beets discharged and
led to a press where most of the remaining water
and sugar are pressed oul the pulp cake is used
in the wet condition for cattle food or it may
be dried with the e haust steam so it can
be preserved for the same purpose it may also be
used to spread over the land and serve as a
fertiltxer csrbonation the purification of the sugar solution as above
extracted consists of the ap plication of lime carbon dioxide
and sulphur together with settling and filtering the use of
the lime followed by that of carbon dioxide is termed
carbonation these two materials lime and carbon dioxide are obtained
by burning limestone in a idln constructed for that pur
pose at the factory the limestone is decom posed and
the lime mixed with water is added to the sugar
solution in a quantity equal to 2 or 3 per
cent the gas is led from the lime hiln through
water to wash it and admitted into a large cell
from five to six feet in diameter with a capacity
of from 4000 to 6000 gallons these cells are provided
with steam coils so the solution may be healed the
temperature at which the carbonation is carried on is 80
to 90 c this process of adding lime then charging
with carbonic add gas is repeated two or three times
depending upon the quality of the juice but after the
first treatment the juice is filtered each time before repeating
the carbonation finally the juice is treated with sulfur dioxide
which is used to bleach the solution and then the
excess of this gas or add is removed by the
addition of lime and the juice is ain treated with
carbonic add be fore filtering the juice it is allowed
to settle so that the impurities may collect at the
bottom of the settling tank the clear liquid is drawn
ofl and filtered by gravity throurii bags these bags are
arranged in pairs a large bag with a diameter of
three or four feet is partially fomed and put into
one of thicker and stronger material with a diameter of
not more than 12 to is inches when the bags
become filled with impurities they are steamed and washed and
made ready for anodier operation thai por tion of the
solution containing the bulk of im purities is also filtered
through bags which are placed in a filter press and
much of the liquid removed the press cake is scattered
over the field and used as a fertilizer the clarifltid
jtiice is treated the same as under cane sugar molabbea
the molasses containing 40 to so per cent of sugar
discharged by the centri fugal must be treated for the
sur which it contains thouf some of it in louisiana
is sold to merchants for direct consumption as table molasses
to confectioners and to glucose mixers for the preparation of
glucose syrup generallj this molasses is recooked t has been
separated the first reboiling yiel second sugar and second molasses
the second reboiling third sugar and third molasses etc the
reboiling may be done directly in the vacuimi pan without
previous treatment in which case 5 to 10 per cent
of water is evaporated the boiled mass put into hotroom
cars and kept at a temperature suffi cient to maintain
the masse cuile in rather loose or limpid state for
from one to three weeks or put into lare cylindrical
slowly revolving drums provided with a proper supply of heat
and kept in these for three to four days to
permit cryst lization to take place in motion in either
case the masse cuite is returned to the centrifugal and
the crystals separated from toe molasses the practice at some
factories is to mix the molasses with hot juice before
reboiling while others put it into eliminating pans cfiarge it
with steam dilute and reclarify the second sugar may be
sold to the refineries but as it falls below the
96tcst sugar probably the most profitable grade ii is melted
in the hot juice and turnea out as first sugar
of the test above mentioned the second molasses is re
boiled to string proof put into large magma tanks or
hotroom cars about five by five leet and three to
four feet deep and allowed to remain at rest from
four to six months when the crystallized mass is subjected
to centrifugal ing the third molasses usually contains a large
portion of impurities which may make it unprofitable to further
reboil it though some work this molasses for fourth sugar
all the above grades of sugar recovered by reboiling may
be worked back into a first sugar or sold to
the refineries the refuse or exhausted molasses which amounts to
from four to five gallons per ton of cane crushed
a 3 40 cent sugar has increased vengt much in
recent years selling at 6 to 10 per gallon some
of it is fed to stock and some consumed by
distiller the molasses from the beet is worked over again
and finally in some factories diluted treated with powdered quicklime
which forms filtered and evaporated to obtain sugar the final
disposition of the beet molasses is also unprofitable refining the
refining of sugar consists in washing melting purifying evaporating and
recrystallizing some factories in louisiana turn out two or three
grades of refined sugar or sugar that is sold mrect
to the trades but as the process used hy them
for refining con sists chiefly in washing with water with
a solution of tin chloride ultramarine or phos phoric add
it is expensive because of the large portion of the
sugar that is dissolved while washing in the centrifueal machine
while clarified yeilow clarified and granulated d by google wi
8ugab growing and suoak making sugars are the grades referred
to but the amoimt of these turned out is decreasing
every jear the chief difference between refining and manufacturing of
sugar is in the method of clarincation this is similar
in almost every respect except in the refinery the sugar
sju tion alter melting and chemical treatment and gitering is
filtered through bone black or bpne cnarcoal this substance has
the property of decolorizing the sugar solution which leaves these
filters in an almost colorless condition the evaporation and crystallization
are carried 5 to 25 years tlie tugar season is
from no vember to februaix the sugar is obtained by
tapping the tree the capping ctmsists in mak ing a
triangular hole in the tree into which the sap is
collected the sap is withdrawn frtmi the tree by means
of a spile in a btat bored beneath and inclined
tipward to the sap recep tacle through this spite the
sap runs out and is collected ia eardienware vessels the
spile is generally made of bamboo cane the flow ol
sap is more rapid at night than in the day
and the cooler the night the greater die flow a
llu natboil cuw shredder u out in the same way
as in manufacturing the bone charcoal soon loses its power
to decolorize and is then revivified by burning out the
absorbed material in specially constructed re torts the bone black
will finally be exhausted of its valuable property of decolorizing
and it is then sold to the fertiliser manufacturer for
the manufacture of acid phosphates the refuse molasses is used
for making alcohol for cul inary purjioses and to some
extent for making lampblack and shoe polish comparison of cane
and beet sugar when highly refined no one can distinguish
be tween cane and beet sugar as thev are one
and the same thing between the crude or raw beet
and cane sugars there is a great difference the tatter

mixed with a little lime and evaporated in open vessels
in a very crude way the boiling is continued until
the sap is a thick syrupy con sistency or until
it forms on cooling a solid mass the solidifying or

been known for a very ions time as an article
of commerce maple sujar the variety of maple tree acer
barbalum is the one from which sugar is chiefly obtained
this tree rows wild in the forest or is cultivated
in ohio indiana new york vermont and other northeastern states
and to some extent in canada it is only within
the last few decades that the trees have been cultivated
to any great extent a tree is 30 to 40
years old before it yields the maximum amount of sugar
a short tree with broad spreading branches is said to
produce larger yields and richer quality of sap than the
tall ones with less foliage the sugar period is from
january to april the sap begins to flow ax tha
breakup of winter so in one section the sap may
flow as early as january while in the colder sections
it may not flow before march the flow lasts from
six weeks to two months the sap or sugar may
be extracted from the tree in a manner similar to
that of extracting it from the palm but the triangular
hole has e roved to be more injurious than a

the sap is drawn into vacs or pans usually made

can be profitably enracted commerce the sugar trade of the
world has become so great that international agree ment has
been necessary to regulate it european countries for quite a
number of years have paid directly and indirectly bounties to
r producers and refiners on their exports this encouraged and
abnormally developed the sur industry in some countries and depressed
it m others the bounties placed the price of sugar
so high that the poorer people in bounty paying countries
could not afford it and so low m many nonbo
untypaying countries that the industry was no longer profitable to
producers a movement was started in england in 1887 to
correct this evil a convention representing austria belgium germany great
britain ital the netherhnds russia and spain met in london
30 aug issamp and passed a resoht tion to guarantee
that no open or disguised bounty shall be granted on
the manufacture or exportation of sugar france would not enter
the agreement because the united states would have nothing to
do with it thei was no ratification of this convention
though it should have taken place 1 aug 1890 the
bounties paid by germany and austriahungary were reported to be
about 16 per ton and this ws approximately doubled in
1896 renewed efforts were then made to break up the
bounty system and this was practically accomplished temporarily at least
in brussels 1 march 1902 after eight sittings of an
international conven tion this was the eighth eurotean sugar bounty
conference since one held in paris in 1862 germany austriahungary

the large increase in sugar export during these years was
due to the european war early in the fall ol
1917 ihe international sugar committee was formed to arrange for
the dis tribution of the available sugar in the world
the committee consisted of two members from each of the
allied zovemments two from the united states fooo administration being
also supplemented by the head of the sugar division this
committee arranged for the purchase and distribution of all sugar
to the allied countries and as it became difficult to
procure household supplies in december 1917 the united states senate
directed an inquiry into the causes of ihe shortage of
sugar this was found to be due largely to consumer
hoarding and to the unusual amounts used for home preserves
also to about twofifths of the whole iuantity con sumed
in the united states being required for the manufacture of
candy the efficiency of the food administration of the international
committee and the willing cooperation of the eeople served to
keep down the price to regu tte the supply and
to tide over the difampculty and the shortages occasioned by
the indiscrim inate sinkings of merchant vessels through tbt german
submarine policy in 1916 the government of panama was authorized
to loan 500000 to plantation oper ators for the development
of the sugar ittdusiiy in that country the loans to
be repaid within 10 years a government subsidy of one
cent on every four pounds of while granulated sugar produced
was also granted in 1917 from its development fund great

suicide the act of intentionally destroy ing ones own life
whether sane or insane the act in itself accompanied by
the purpose is suicide the condition of sanity or insanity
bears on the question of responsibility in con sidering the
causes which lead to suicide it may be weu to
mention the motives which deter from it first of all
is the natural love of life which leads even condemned
criminals perhaps awaiting death by torture to cling to uie
few hours or days remaining to them this love of
life is in the very nature of all living beings
and it is not always or even usually to be
measured by the apparent value of existence to the individual
it is at least as strong in the dimer indian
or the kongo negn as ia the cized and welltodo
resident of america or europe there is next among the
more in telligent whether religiously inclined or not the sense
of duty to outers among the strictly leligioue there is
the dread of punishment be yond the grave and statistics
indicate that this is a potent and prevalent deterrent frooi
self destruction suicide is not in itself a sign of
weakness of intellect there were perioib of depressioa in the
revolutionary struggle when washington was despondent almost to the point
of welcom ing death and bismarck once contemplated suicide napoleon

that the dark and gloomy weather might produce such a

men who either committed suicide or attempted it or were
on the brink of ii although there arc no statistics
for compaii fion yet the observations of trustworthy nar rators
indicate that suidde is very much more common among asiatics
than among western nations arthur h smith dd says there
are parts of china in which young girb band themselves
into a secret league to commit auicide within a certain
bme after they hare been betrotked or married that the
practice of suicide ib adopted even by children and for
causes relatively triflins at times it amiears to spread like
the smallpox and the thirst for suicide becomes virtually an
epidemic china is probably the only country in the world
m which criminals are permitted or rather di rected as
an act of special grace to commit suicide before the
japanese adopted civilized methods suicide was also prevalent among them

the victim disembowel ing himself with knife or sword in
india vast numbers of fanatics soupht death under the car

these practices it is yet an undecided question whether edu
cation fosters the tendency to suidde or not thomas gariigue
masaiyk qv first presi dent of the czechoslovak republic when
a lecturer oti philosophy at vienna in 1879 came into
prominence by a study on suicide as a pathological symptom
of the condition of coh tcmporary europe he attributed its
chief cause to the dedine of religious sentiment it cannot
be alleged that education has anything to do with the
epidemics of suidde among chi nese women on the other
hand it is easy to luppose and statistics appear to
support the e resumption that other things equal a preva
nee of materialism a disbelief in things supei natural and
consequent loss of assurance that privations and sufferings here are
to be recom pensed by an eternity of happiness hereafter

anlidpate by a few years tfadr inevitable des tiny bismarck
said di at if this world were the end of
all it would not be worth the dressing and the
undressing so far therefore as edu cation helps to promote
materialism it pro motes suicide at the same time it
is to be remembered that such men as tyndall and
darwin who were avowedly in discord with accepted religious tenets
regarded it as a duty and a pleasure to live
and do their share of lifes worii professor bailey of
the social sdence de partment at vale after examining 10000

rcverberatories and converter treatment of lnn ore etcores are treated
in blast furnaces using coke as fuel in greater or
less amounts according to the smaller or larger content of
pyrite in the ore the smelting generally practised in the
united states is known as uie aemipyritic and it takes
advantage of the fuel value of the sul phides in
the ore as far as possible the tines are briquetted
before charging them into the blast furnace wherever suitable bonding
material is obtainable at low cost for example slimes from
the water concentra tion of the copper ores jn some
localities the fines are sintered and in others noduhzcd to
prepare them for blast furnace treatment the resulting matte and
slag are treated in ways similar to those obtaining in
reverberatory smelting converting the most common tvpe of converter is
the trough converter witn rows of tuyeres along the back

linings are usually made of magnesite brick the proa ucts
of the converter arc sulphurous gases which escape through the
flues and stacks slag which is returned to the blast

is either cast in pigs or anodes for electrolvtic refining
and the extraction of gold and silver values for refining
see electbocheuical industries the improvements in recent years in the
sul phide smelting have consisted in the adoption of mechanicat
roasters the arrangement of the furnaces so that the product
can be trans ferred from one department to another with
minimum loss of heat and with tfie least pos sible
handling and the enlargement of the smelt ing units for
example some reverberatory smelting furnaces now have a hearth measure
ment of 25 x 146 feet and a smelting capacity
of over 1000 tons daily blast furnaces may now be
built of unlimited length ae largest measuring 56 inches by
87 feet at the tttyeres with a daily caacity of
3000 tons of charge converters holding over 100 tons of
matte have been built but the most economical size seems
to be of a capacity of about 80 tons other
eco nomical practices are the handling of slag ashes and
other waste products in sluice boxes by water the handling
of materials generally by machinery and the saving of waste
heat from sffleitiit furnaces all the modem appli ances for
handlinft roatcriak water stcwn electricity and compressed air are called
upon to assist in the operation of modern plants fuel
oil and pulverized coal have been applied to reverberatoty furnaces
with great success in recent years developments looked for in
the near future are the substitution of electric fur naces
for the blast furnaces and an extension of the hydrometallurgical
processes the industry is prosecuted on a gigantic scje in
the united states the amount of capi tal invested is
enormous the average cost of a sulphide smelting establishment being
1000 for each ton of ore treated daily the largest
plant constructed to date 1919 is the anaconda reduction works
at anaconda mont having a daily capacity of 18000 tons
of ore and produc ing about 15 per cent of
the worlds output of copper a brief description of this
smelter will give a general idea of the operation of
a modern copper sulphide smelting plant and the immense sue
of the plant the copper ores delivered on the high
line by the butte ana conda and pacific railway are
first mriched fay mechanical concentration in this process the useless
part of the ore is separated from the valuable portion
by making use of differences in specific gravity the useless
part being sluiced to the dump and the 3 per
cent of copper in the ore becoming 8 per cent
in the concentrated product the fine portion of his product
is roasted to remove 80 per cent of its sulphur
and is then smelted in reverberatory furnaces the coarser portion
goes to the blast furnaces in which the burning off
of 60 per cent of the sulphur and the melting
of the charge are done in one operation the reverb
era to ties and blast furnaces produce matte the copper
content of which ranges from 40 to so per cent
and make slag as a waste product which is sluiced
to the dump the matte is treated in converters which
deliver an impure copper the last stage is reached in
the refining furnaces which turn out the commer cially pure
metal and this is shipped to the companys electrolytic plants
at great falb mont and perth amboy n j where
the silver and the small amount of gold are separated
the metals are then marketed the zinc ore is increased
