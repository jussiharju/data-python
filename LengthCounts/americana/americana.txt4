bordered by numerous islands formed from the detritus brought down
by the rivers and banked up south of their outlets
by the currents and waves of the sea they are
fringed between high and low tide by salt marshes and
extensive beds of oysters peculiar to this latitude the mean
rise of the tide in the savannah river is 69
feet and diminishes eastward to 35 feet at the georgetown
entrance the tides push the fresh water of the streams
before them on the flood 15 to 30 miles inland
and render lidewaler irrigation of the rice fields practicable the
salt water rivers sepa rating the islands from rach other

agrictiltnre the settlers in carolina sooa ascertained that its soil
and climate were suit able for all the plants of
the old world grow ing from the subtropical to the
subarctic regions besides a most varied flora of its own
they found also extensive pastures supporting numerous herds of wild
buflato elk and deer the horses and cattle introduced by
the span iards increased rapidlv in numbers it might have
been thought tnat here were elements favorable for a diversified
husbandry the colonists however discovered an agricultural monopoly and an
export money crc in rice it required capital for drainage
and irrigation and a thoroughly organized and reliable labor able
to resist the malarial influences of the rice swamps negro
slaves fulfilled these condi tions english merchants furnished the negroes
and supplies on credit the english parlia ment favored the
exportation of rice and it became a most profitable crop
when cotton was introduced in the 18ih century as it
grew on healthy uplands and did not require much capital
it was suspected that the small white farmer would undertake
its culture the small farmers however did not except as
overseers modeled themselves after the methods of an agriculture that
bad been successful for nearly two centuries they confined their
en ergies largely to one money crop for export they
worked at it with hired latwr on borrowed money purchased
instead of breeding work ani mals bought a notable portion
of their sup plies and largely of fertilirers the lien
law securing the collection of ad vances made on growing
crops often even be fore they were planted and the
lien law re quiring the enclosure of all livestock leaving
lands under crops unenclosed promoted exist ing tendencies in agriculture
removing the cost of fencing on lands under crops led
to a wide deforestation and careless cultivation in 1880 there

removed shortly after to the cotifluence of the ashley and
copper rivers where they founded the city of charleston the
proprietary government was conducted tuider b royal charter and certain
fundamental constitutions drawn for that purpose by the famous metaphysician
john locke in order to avoid erecting a too numerous
democracy loike designed a territorial aristocracy of land graves cacigues
and barons the colonists however insisting upon the clause of
the kings charter directing the lords proprietors to gov ern
according to their best discretion by and with the advice
assent and approbation of the freemen of said territory or
their deputies or delegates prevented from first to last this
aristocracy from taking root in the colony the proprietary government
without adaptability to the circumstances and necessities of the colony
promoted endless discussions and dissensions as to the interpretation of
the charter and the constitutions a succession of heats and
broils during 49 years culminated in 1719 the proprietors expressed
their inability to aid the colonists refused petitions addressed to
them on important matters and repealed acts of the assembly
laying taxes for the discharge of the public debt and
for the freedom of elections the assembly thereupon voted itself

great britain imposed restrictions on the commerce and domestic manufactures
of her colonies while this was prejudicial to the more
northern colonies it did not affect an agricultural people like
the carolinians the restraint imposed by the navigation acts on
colonial exports was removed on the export of carolina rice
the exports of rice and indigo reached 108750 in 1747

mother country as home in the midst of this prosperity
carolina was led step by step during a period of
11 years through sympathy with the northern colonies for injuries
inflicted on them to take part against the enforcement by
great britain of taxation without representation without desiring or an

constitution but with the pro viso that this constitution is
but temporary iinttl an accotmnodation of the ttnfaappy differ ences
between the colonies and great britain can be obtained in
1778 john rutledge governor of the i state declared such
an accommodation an event as desirable now as it ever

in 1780 when the state lay prostrate that the out
rages of the british armies roused to resistance the population
from the seaboard to the moun tains they then flocked
to the standards of the partisan leaders marion simiter pickens
and others and so harassed and delayed the northward movement
of comwalus to join clinton that washinn and lafayette were
enabled to unite in virginia and force the brit ish

arising from numerous and separate centres of rural settlement had
the larser and more rapidly increasing number of wnite in
habitants the first tariff act of 1789 imposed an ad
valorem duty of 5 per cent on imports with a
few specific duties of is per cent for the support
of the federal government this was in addition to the
taxes ried by each slate ior its own purposes it
was much higher taxa tion than under the colonial government
which required in ordinary times only a duly of 3
per cent on imports with an export duty of 3d
on hides four years later the tariff was raised to
10 and 20 per cent ten years after duties were
increased 2 per cent in aid of the mediterranean fund
against the barbary powers double war duties amounting to 25
to 40 per cent were imposed in 1812 in 1816
a tariff protecting the in dustries that had been found
necessary but deficient during the late war fixed duties at
25 per cent to be reduced to 20 per cent
in 1820 the carolina representatives supported this not unreasonable protection
the reduc tion never took place and at this the
carolina representatives protested disregarding their protest a tariff imposing 12
to 50 per cent duties was passed in 1824 again
in 1 with out regard to the complaints of the
carolina faimers who were being forced to contribute to the
manufacturing profits of other states a tariff raising duties 25
to 50 per cent was enacted wearied with unavailing remonstrance
a convention of the people of carolina was called in
1832 which declared the protective tariff law unconstitutional null and
void to meet this action of the state congress passed
the force bill in 1833 for the collection of customs
in the same month of the same year congress passed
the clay compromise act for a gradual reduction of duties
until 1842 when they should reach a 20 per cett
level this restored iranquillihr although for the sec ond time
the promised reduction was never fully realized coincident with the
tariff another and more serious source of disturbance arose in
1775 slavery extended over north america from canada to florida
inclusive it had been in troduced by queen elizabeth and
james ii belonged to the royal african company for trading
in negro slaves now it began to be looked upon
with horror as something strange and forei to human instincts
the new eng land antislavery society was formed in 1832
in less than four years more than 100000 per sons
had joined anti slavery societies in the northern and western
states they demanded of congress that all slaves should be
instantly set free vnthout compensation of the owners they declared
we will give the union for the abolition of slavery
llie lesson was taught far and wide that the slaveholders
of the south a few arrogant domineering self constituted racy
were throu the representation allowed them in proporlon to the
number of their slaves ruling the workpeople of the north
and denying their industries the pro tection due from the
federal government they declared that the country must become all
free or all slave the n onsl a veholding whites
of the south were as violently opposed to the lage
banks emancipation of the negroes as their brethren of the
north were in favor of it to them it meant
industrial political and social equality with a people in their
midst whom they deemed inferior to themselves they did not
ask for aid to their industries through federal taxation and
did not see why northern manufacturers should after years of
angry discussion along these lines the crisis came during a
period of unprecedented prosperity in carolina on the election by
the anti slavery party of a president in 1860 by
less than a third of the popular vote it found
the peoples north and south solidly arrayed arainst each other
with fatal unanimity the irrepressible conflict burst into war the
north took the offensive for federal domination and patronagte and
for race equality freedom and fraternity they were sustained by
the popular sentiment of the euiopean masses south carolina and
the south rose to a man with no sympathy or
support from without in defense of state autonomy and white
supremacy from an armsbearing population of 55046 in carolina 44000

class in defense of the domestic institutions of the state

negroes who in earlier days had been enticed away by
promises from the spaniards and had sometimes sided with the

to their masters in this war served their families and
tilled their fields while they were absent the issue was
decided by force of arms and numbers and was never
submitted to legal adjudication no indictments for treason as is
usual in rebellions were made an export duty was placed
on cotton and import duties were increased by the national
government for 12 years negro suy premacy was enforced in
the state by the fed eral army when on 10
april 1877 the federal guard filed out of the south
door of the capitol at columbia the neno government collapsed
without a struggle the white dtiiens qtuetly resumed the administration
of affairs president eliot of harvard in a speech before
the ceo tial labor union in boston february 1904 on
the worldwide conflict of labor and capital sums up the
result of this titanic struggle in these words how many
things my genera tion thought were decided at appomattox but
during the subsequent 40 years it has gradually appeared that
hardly anything was settled there except the preservation of the
unity of the national territory for more than two cen
turies imder 10 written constitutions the state had been governed
by a more than usually cen traliced democracy opposing a
similar cen tralization of functions by the federal union the
collision dispersed these functions into smaller and smaller civil divisions
counties townships school districts the latter re stricted to an
area of 9 to 40 square miles were endowed with
the sovereign power to lay taxes and incur debt a
centrifugal tendency is noticeable also in subdivision of farms and
in establishment of crossroad stores and vil d google south

gubernatorial con test of 1890 was most bitter between the
so called aristocrats and the plebs or farmers alliance the
latter were victorious and elected their candidate ben tillman to
the governor ship liquor regulation and legislation caused serious political
turmoil from 1893 to 1907 when the stale liquor dispensaries
were abol ished because of charges of corruption in 1910
prohibition was a campaign issue and went down lo defeat
when coleman l blease was elected governor blease was soon
involved with the state supreme court over judicial rominations refusing
to commission anyju didal appointees other than his personal friends
about 1911 the governor began to pardon con victs wholesale
and by the end of his second term had considerably
depleted the prison popu lation he also exercised his veto
to an ex traordinary degree but very many acts were
passed over his veto despite considerable op position blease was
reelected in 1912 on ii jan 1915 blease disbanded the

tion of the state from the broken interior edge of
this slope this sedimentary plateau one descends a bluff and
enters a central area of slatesgranite and quartz ites formation
these are in many places carved into high ridges and
sharp peaks cut by numerous nar row and deep valleys
and ravines and with thicklyset rocky mountain pine timber toward
the south of this elevated plateau harney peak rises to
7244 feet above sealevel and iitteresiing surface the table lands
correspond approximately to the early surface of the state they
slope from an altitude of about 3500 feet along the
western boundary eastward to an altitude of 2000 feet near
the northeast corner and to 1450 feet near the southeast
comer this makes an average slope eastward of about four
feet per mile along the northern boundary and less than
six feet along the southern boundary the highlands are eroded
into un dulations and traces are present of hier strata
which every here and there stand out as bultes and
ridges the region which best illustrates this peculiarity is the
northern part of that district lying west of the missouri
river on the east side of the river these high
lands are less prominent and yet may be readily located
the bijou hills wessiion hills ree hills etc are all
of this same formattoa as are the choteau creek hills
and turkey ridge in the southern portion of the stale
there are three very important valleys crossing the stale from
north to south these are the uissouri the james and
biff sioux the min nesota also touches the nortnem portion
of the state where it has an altitude of about
1000 feet above the sea the james river valley is
from 60 to 70 miles wide and from 1200 feet
high at about the northern boundary line to 100 feet
at the southern une it has five im portant branches
one extends west from aberdeen at an altitude of about
1500 feet another west from scotland and the fourth southeast
from marion the fifth is northeast from aberdeen and connects
this james valley with the minnesota all of these valleys
have been very much eroded by glacial movements and are
less sharply defined than are the valleys west of the
missouri river the missouri river valley is very narrow usually
less thaa three miles in width in south dakota its
western tributaries are also marked by narrow caronlike valleys examples
of this are the grand the cheyenne and white river
carons along all of these western rivers may be found
a similarity of formation quite unique and pre senting many
features of interest to the stu dent of nature on
the extreme eastern side of the state extending nearly the
entire length of the same and forming for nearly 100
miles the eastern boundary is the big sioux river valley
this endiraccs the best agricultural soil in the state and
is not surpassed in fer tility by any state in
the union the bad lands these have become famous their
features and treasures early attracted the hunter and the explorer
the term liad has been applied to them because of
the difficulty of exploring that reon the most notable bad
lands or mauvaisej terres in the state are located between
the cheyenne and white rivers this whole region is cut
up by deep ravines bounded largelv with hi continuous clay
bluffs most of tne surface i without useful vegetation the
peaks and bluffs seem to have been carved by erosion
out of the white clays marls and sands of the
tertiary geological period the bad lands have become widely known
chiesy through the fossil remains they contain the most fruitful
field for this is what is known as indian draw
a south branch of the cheyenne river here the streatn
has eroded a valley five or six miles in width
bounded by steep clifls over 300 feet high this valley
is studded with an indescrib able labyrinth of buttes ravines
grasly valleys and dry water courses here the light coloreis
clays of the tertiary period rest directly on the dark
cretaceous shales in the lower strata of the tertiary are
to be found the best fossil many of these have
found their w best european museums and are evi dences
of mammoth animals of various types that once inhabited the
forests of the state archkological remaina the state also contains
interesting archfeological remains these indicate the occupancy of a prehistoric
race of greater industry and intelligence than the indians later
encountered by the white man one of these is the
remains of a strong fort near pierre it embraces about
130 acres of ground is admirably located for strategic pur
poses is laid out with a skill and accuracy that
challenges the admiration of modern military engineers within this are
found remnants of pottery which give evidence of a hih
degree of skill and artistic sense copper mstruments hily tempered
are also found indicating an art now lost to man
the walls of the fortifica tion are very heavy and
well constructed sug gesting an industry and a sldl never
exhibited by any indian tribes there are similar fortifi cations
at several other strategic points in the state such as
chamberlain and campbell county near old fort wadsworth in mar
shall county are also extensive mounds which army engineers long
ago pronounced must be long to a prehistoric race cumate

wilderness inliabited onbf by wild beasts and savage indians a
few adventurers such as lesueur trudeau and loisel had traversed
this land to some extent in their traffic with the
indians and in some instances attempted set tlement but these
were soon abandoned all this region was marked on the
maps of riiose days an unexplored country in 1804 lewis
and clark visited the territory their records show that in
august of that year 1804 they camped for three days
at yankton where the yankton or james river empties into
the missouri from there they went up the missouri exploring
that river through the en lire territory of dakota then
up the yellow stone and on to the pacific the
first white set tlement of record in the state was
made on 11 nov 1794 in what is now charles

become permanent neither did the settlement on the missouri river
at big bend made in 1797 by registre loiael fort

remained to this day the american fur compamr made incur
sions into the territory as ear as 1611 in june
1831 a steamboat built by this fur com pany found
its way to fort pierre this was the first steamboat
to navigate the upper missouri and was named the yellowstone
yellowstone made another trip up the through south dakota in
1832 and this time went as far north as the
mouth of the yellow stone river amonp its passengers on
this trip was geoftc catlin the famous painter and ethnologist
mr catlin spent some time at fort pierre during the
summer of 1832 study ing the indian in his primitive
life and again visited the state in 1836 while inspecting
the work of the indians at pipestone quarry in western
minnesota in 1838 gen john c fremont the noted pathfinder
explored the easte portion of the state taking levels of
prominent points and discoverinfr and naming many lakes the next
year 1839 he again visited the state going bv steamboat
to fort pierre and from there northeast to devils lake
n d he was accompanied this time by joseph n
nicollet geographer and astronomer by 1840 the activity of the
american fur com eny bad decreased the buffalo herds and
fur aring animals of the dakota territory and the fur
industry was fast losing its importance in this region ten
or 12 years more or by 1855 the fur trade
of dakota was about over and the great buffalo herds
of the plains had nearly disappeared fort pierre was sold
that crar by the american fur company to the nited
states government and thereafter be came a military post between
the fort pierre settlement in 1817 and that of sioux
falls in 1858 there seems to have been little attention
given to the fertile prairies of this preat territory the
settlement at sioux falls m 1856 opened the way for
rapid and permanent occupation of the rich bottomlands of the
big sioux river the next year 1857 the minne sota
legislature chartered the dakota land company and from that on
settlements were made at various places on the eastern side
of the state and along the missouri river a territorial
government was provided by congress in 1861 after a long
controversy be tween citizens of the territory and congres sional
representatives from minnesota the lat ter claiming that dakota belonged
to and was a part of the minnesota territorj indian
war fare interfered very seriously with the settle ment and
development ot this new land for a number of years
by 1862 there were many settlers established along the missouri
and the sioux rivers during harvest season that year 1862
the santee sioux on the minnesota river took to the
warpath and massacred white settlers wherever they could find them
kear sioux falls these bloodthirsn savages af tacked and killed
judge joseph amidon and bis son in the hayfield this
caused terror in the hearts of nearby settlers who left
their stock and crop and fled for their lives at
this time the indians destroyed many homes and large numbers
of stock also grain in abundance just ready for the
harycst another outbreak oc curred in 1865 when much property
was again destroyed and some settlers killed in 1869 a
treaty was signed between the indians of dakota plains and
the federal authorities but this did not last many years
by june 1876 further outbreaks occurred and the govern ment
sent a large force of federal troops under cneral custer
to quell the outbreak but this brave general with some
3cx of his men were killed before peace could be
arranged with the indians this however was about the last
of indian warfare and after that date settlers suffered but
little from attacks by indians govemmedl south dakota became a

sovereign 1 in politics the high est person in a
stale applied also adjeccively to the highest power in a
state or to a state which exercises supreme or independent
authority thus the legislature in its various branches is the
sovereign power in each state though the name of sovereign
in a limited monarchy is re served for the monarch
and a state which owns no superior is termed a
sovereign state 2 a fold coin the standard of the
english coinage t exchanges for 20 shillings sterling or about
sovereignty in political science the supreme power in a state
by which the govern ment is administered in republics generally
it if held that sovereity resides in the people but
in some countries like japan it is held that it
is possessed by the sovereign various theories have been advanced
as to the origin of soverrignty some contending that it
is the prerogative of the stronger force others that it
is created by divine sanction and still others that it
is created bv voluntary contract or that it is a
property right descending in regular line of succession milton and
locke in the 17th century contended that the peopli revolution
the declaration of independence asserted the same doctrine when it
declared that governments derive their just powers from the consent
of the governed and in polit ical addresses of the
time the principle was frequently enunciated in all sections of
the country that the people had the right lo alter
their governments whenever and in whatsoever manner they deemed expedient
these prin ciples were embodied in the state constitutions and
even the right of revolution was therein asserted the doctrine
of poijular sovereignty is almost universally accepted in europe at
the present time sovereignty is of two kinds internal and
external internal sovereignty includes all governmental powers which a state
possesses over its own citizens or foreigners domiciled therein and
over private ships on the high seas external sovereignty includes
the right to enter into relations with foreign states as
by treaty or by declaring war there has been much
contention as to whether each stale in the union is
vested with sovereignty or whether it resides solely in the
united states the prevailing view is that the sovereignty of
a state is legally limited and therefore not absolute although
before the civil war this view was not at all
general internal sovereignty is divided into political sovereignly and legal
sovereignty political sovereignty is the final supreme power residing in
any political societj legal sovereignty is the power which is
in ical control at any specified period other distinctions are
de facto and de jure sovereignty the former of which
is sovereigntj that has been assumed but is obeyed by
the citizens though not resting on a legal basis and
the latter of which is sovereignty founded on law some
authors refuse lo recognize these two distinctions a stale may
have internal sovereignty but d google 818 not external sovereignty
as by yielding its right to make war or lo
negotiate with other slates in international law however such states
while subject lo other stales are treated as sovereign powers
under this head are in cluded protectorates and suzerainties some
recent writers advocate the elimina tion of the term sovereignty
from political science on the ground that it is synonymous
with absolutism and should not be applied to the supreme
power in any constitutional federal or similar government soviet pron
savyet a russian word signifying council advice harmony concord sovietnik
councillor under the old regime the tsars council of ministers
was eallef the soviet of ministers but the term has
been invested with a new meaning since the russian revolution
of march 1917 the popular or ganizations which then came
into existence were called councils of workmens and soldiers deputies
bodies which were supposed to be holding things together under
the provisional government until the election of the con stituent
assembly could take place in a sense they were vigilance
committees designed to guard against counter revolution the petro prad
soviet of 4000 members was the most important of these
on account of its position in the capital and its
influence over the garri son by degrees the orderly and
moderate ele ment was pushed out of this group and
the extremists who demanded all power to the soviets became
supreme when the constituent assembly eventually met the bolshevild and
their alhes were in a mmority yei they suc ceeded
in breaking up the assembly and finally came out with
their own program the so called soviet government chaos and
disorders paralyzed the upholders of constitutional de mocracy because they
lacked both authority and the power to restrain the wild
elements the latter on the other hand possessed the red
guard a powerful armed mob while the soviet leaders mainly
ambitious doctrinnairessaw in the instrument of their creation a road
to fame and power soon the soviet system was invested
with intellectual justification as a higher tstie of stale and
a higher form of democracy which would arouse the masses
of the exploited toilers to the task of making new
history furthermore it offered to the oppressed toiling masses the
opportunity to par ticipate actively m the free construction of
a new society according to lenine the author of these
quotations soviet rule is nothing else than the organized form
of the dictatorship of the proletariat a loose code of
rules govern ing elections to the soviels was framed but
the following classes were disqualified to vote those who employ
others for profit those who live on incomes not derived
from their own work interest on capital industrial enter prises

new stem of govern ment has appeared in sovietism not
a little speculation nas been aroused in countries out side
of russia and a considerable number of political thinkers have
analyzed the future possi bilities of soviet rule the reign
of terror and bloodshed which accompanied that rule in russia
may be regarded as an accidental transi tory phase in
the history of a country where violent occurrences are no
novelties it is neces sary to separate barbarity and invidious
class distinctions from sovietism itself and to con sider the
tatter purely as a political experiment of some importance the
essence of the con flict between the parliamentary and the
soviet systems is whether the basis of representation shall be
political or economic using these words in their narrowest sense
the conception of the soviet as ultimately representative of the
local economic groupings factories and pro ductive areas explains the
enthusiasm of the neomarxians who admit no politics outside the
economic sphere for the soviet system the elements of which
they see in the works committees and such like combinations
in modem largescale industry some admirers however regard the soviet
system as a dual one with parallel political and industrial
or ganizations though it is probable that in prac tice
the two branches merge in a single channel the economic
here we have only to ask whether a factorys political
soviet would be likely to work independently of its economic
soviet to realize that a separate standpoint is possible only
in theory the soviet govern ment in russia claims to
be in such close re lations with the proletarian organizations
on which it is based that at 11 times the
greater jwrt of the population joins in the administra tion
of the state and that every worker may initiate in
his soviet a plan for reorganing his industry which has
only to be examined by the sovets higher up and
ratified to become law if the soviet system really fulfilled
its claim to instruct the elector by giving him actual
administrative experience this would be a good argument in its
favor but in practice the demagogue and the party man
dominate the high soviets and these m their turn lord
it over the lesser bodies hence the value of the
system as an administrative training school disappears and the machine
offers notning use ful that could not be obtained by
parliamentary government many sincere democratically minded people in other countries
have grown dissatisfied with their systems of parliamentary government and
have consequently been half prepared to welcome the soviet idea
as an alternative various causes have been advanced as being
responsible for diminishing the prestige of parliaments such as their
remoteness from public opinion which elects but cannot recall them
the congestion of legislative business and the difficulty of carrying
out necessary reforms google sowthistle soy bean 319 ujc party
system and the caucus the corruption arising irom personal and
corporate pressure and the encroachments of cabinets the soviet system
professes to remove these defects and also to introduce reforms
which seem unal able under parliamentary government of s lall
b compact local administrative units to replace the existing large
and unwieldy ceographical electoral units many theorists indeea regard the
soviet system not as necessarily an instru ment of proletarian
dictatorship but rather as b federation of local electoral groups
which guided by intelligence and with toleration could be transformed
into a genuinely democratic form of government others again vision
a possibitity of separating the political and in dustrial spheres
while extenltng to both the means of selfgovernment in comparing
exist ing institutions with visionary alternatives the advocates of the
latter not infreltiuently fail to foresee the many defects which
are not immediately apparent but must inevitably be expected to
arise in no country have both these systems been fully
tried for russia has never had real parliamentary government and
in bavaria where a soviet repubuc was established in february
1919 the venture so far has not presented the unassailable
argument of suc cess it is difficult to see that
the soviet system can claim any tangible advantage over its
rival especially as the apex of the soviet pyramid is
far more remote from the individual elector than any parliament
or congress altogether it seems easier and safer to overhaul

glycine kisfiida sometimes incorrectly called soja bean native to southeastern

and into america some years later where it was first
grown principally in the southern states its use as a
food for man has not become general except in its
original home in asia and it is only within recent
years that its value as a feed for stock has
brought it to the attention of the western countries the
soy bean is an annual two to four feet high
it has branching hairy stems with trifoliate hairy leaves the
flowers are inconspicuous of pale lilac or violet color and
the fruit is a broad two to fiveseeded pod covered
like the rest of the plant with stiff reddish hairs
the seeds vary in color according to variety when grown
tor the seed the crop sometimes yields as high as
40 bushels or more to the acre but the average
is much less as a forage crop it makes as
high as two to three tons of cured hay per
acre the fact that the flowers are self pollinated gives
it an advantage over many other legumes in introducing it
into new regions see douchos innumerable varieties and forms of
the soy bean have been developed in the original home
of the plant several dif ferent varieties have been introduced
into the united states these being distinguished largely according lo
the shape size and color of the seed in the
decree of hairiness and in the time required for the
plants to reach maturity the early varieties are preferred when
the plant is grown for seed while the latter give
better re sults as forage crops some of oie advantages
claimed for it as a crop are that it is
able to gather the food of sustenance in relatively poor
land and by its power to assimilate nitrogen from the
air to enrich the soil in which it grows it
is relatively sure of producing a crop of seeds very
nutritious to livestock for which it is adapted to use
in various forms soy beans require about the same conditions
for growth as corn but have somewhat better powers of
resisting drought the seed is not planted until the ground
is thoroughly warm in the spring and the earlier varieties
are grown with fair results by planting after an early
grain crop has been harvested when planted for forage the
seed is often sown broadcast but where a crop of
beans is desired it is better to plant in drills

and fats have been found of peculiar value in compounding
feed rations fed in connection with less concen trated feeds
and grains having a lower protein content results have been
obtained that show the soy beans to compare favorably in

raw vegetable that contains as high a per centage of
digestible protein and fat tbe soy bean is prepared for
use as hiunan x the plant is also grown in
europe and used there to a limited extent as human
food since the beans contain no starch they are sometimes
recommended as food for persons suffering from diabetes a soybean
bread has been manufactured for this purpose under the name
of coffee bean the soy beans have been placed on

the united states the soy bean is best adapted to
the southern and central states it is not adapted to
the states along the northern border or to the states
west of the rocky mountains in those states where it
thrives it is especially valuable to soils thai have become
depleted of their nitrogen the chemical com position of both
bean and fodder adapts it especially to use as a
balance ration in connec tion with corn and makes its
cultivation de sirable where no other protein feed is available

the actual experienced system which we are accustomed to handle
by means of geometry many theories have been held concerning
its nature the an cient views are not at all
clear but until aristotle at any rate the existence of
empty space is not recognized and there is a gener
tendency to subordinate space to matter the modem theory of
space begins with descartes who makes extension the distinguishing mark
of matter spinioa thotigh he hnds in matter an attribute
of god rather than an independent substance follows descartes in
this respect leibniti does not attribute to space an inde
pendent existence but makes it merely an un clear recognition
of the logical relations of the monads newton on the
other band claims an independent existence for space and maintains
that position is absolute not relative kant solves the dispute
between leibnitz and newton by finding in space and time
respec tively that a priori form of the external and
internal senses so that eomeir is independent of experience yet
spatial entities do not exist apart from sense among the
present views on the subiect is the curious one of
bergson who regaras the spatial description of the uni verse
as a scientinc intellectual peiersion of the temporal flux is
directly presented to inlui the old dispute as to whether
the idea of space is innate or acquired belongs to
a past stage of philosophical discussion and one may take
it as an established act thai the empirical status of
extension is quite analogous to that of any of the
sensory qualities just as my experience of this red blotter
before me is preconditioned by the fact that t am
so con stitutedunlike some colorblind persons as d google space
of dimensions spada 3s1 to be able to perceive red
so my experience of space depeniis on mj having a
nature fitted to perceive spatial entities indeed it seems that
as far as ihe mere nature of the experience is
concerned there is no reason for dividing qualities into the
primary such as those of space and time and the
secondary of color sound etc the distinguishing characteristics of space
reside in its organization rather than in its quality this
organization forms the subject matter of geometryj it is probably
dependent in art on the imnnsic nature of the things
jvhich are in space and go to make up our
spatial experience but it is unquestionably also in a large
measure dependent on the arrange ment which we more or
less consciously make of these sensedata and by the arrangement
of the entities of any sjstem a system may be
obtained whose formal properties are just about what you choose
space thus becomes as poincar has shown a more or
less pliable tool or scientific description so that the ques
tion what is the structure of space may almost be
translated into what spatial struc ture is the simplest and
most manageable for purposes of scientific description as a con
sequence as the formulx of science do not seem to
be markedly simplified hy the postula tion of a noneucudean
space see geomeihy non euclidean or of any other spatial
struc ture other than that which is fanfiliar to us
in our elementary geometry and as this elementary geometry is
simpler in its formulie than non euclidean geometry or other
similar systems we choose albeit unconsciously the struc ture of
our space in such a way that it shall be
euclidean the threedimensional character of space is likewise due to
the fact that a three dimensional system forms the simplest
and most appropriate background to the observed facts of physics
and is not as kant supposed an a priori truth
it we should suddenly find masses varying in such a
manner as to be susceptible of an easy and direct
explanation by a motion perpendicular to our space the very
next work on physics would speak just as confidently of
a space of four dimensions as we now speak of
a space of three a change of a similar nature
has taken place in the last few years see relativmr
the phincifle of whereas space and time were formerly con
ceived as completely independent dimensions the present attitude of physics
is that a body in unaccelerated motion carries with it
as it were a space which is essentially distinct from
the space with reference to which it is in motion
and that distances are not the same when measured with
reference to two sets of axes in relative motion in
other words the system of reference of modem physics cannot
be divided into independent spatial and tem poral parts but
constitutes an essentially homo geneous simtial temporal manifold which is
a euclidean fourdimensional space with real minimal lines see analytical
mitbics the problems of the infinitude and the in finite
divisibility of space and of unoccupied space are again matters
of scientific convenience it is far simpler for the scientist
to have a system of reference which docs not depend
on the entities which are referred to this system than
to be continually hemmed in by the limi tations of
matter and the construction of a vol25 11 system without
lacunas from a system which possesses them is no very
difkcult logical task consequently the space of science is physically
independent of its occupation by matter the problem of the
extension of ihe world forms the subject matter of one
of kants antinomies that of its infinite divisibility is the
subject matter of another both of these antinomies or paradoxes
have a double aspect mathematically they involve the motions of
infinite collections and dense series which have only received a
satisfactory logical treatment within the last halfccntuiy the infinitude of
space and its infinite divisibility are again merely the results
of the scientists protest against the complications brought into his
work hy the supposition of a limited space or a
space which offers obstacles to repeated division thus kant is
both right and wrong when he solves these antinomies by
making space and time forms of perceptive experience not thin
in themselves he is right in so far as the
infinitude and infinite tuvisibiuty of space emanates from ourselves and
not from the object but wrong in that he heheves
that in finitude and infinite divisibility involve vm aoidable contradictions

valley then the western slope is much more extensive and
less abrupt than the eastern and communication between the centre
and the western littoral is naturally easier than between the
centre and the mediterranean but portngal has separated the most
accessible maritime tone from the central highlands and so spn
has kept an extensive littoral without any easy natural communica

of the guadalquivir see rivers the western slope is divided
into five un equal bands by four mountain systems which

which sends its waters directly to the cantabrian sea bay
of biscay these cordilleras have a fundamentally east and west

relatively few p cerning the constitution of tne zones ol

and several of the regions have even become classics for
the geological student thanks to the labors of lion bertrand
and bresson of the andalu sian commission of nickus and
of r dou villi we are beginning lo know with
some pre cision the structure of the two border chains
the pyrenean and the subbitic or penibetic the latter including
the sierra nevada the complexity of the corrugations of the
ancient rocks of the cantabrian chain has been brought cii
v google to light by barrois but as lo all
that relates to the inequalities of the central portion of
the meseta grouped togelher by choftat under the name of
the lusilanocasdiian system we are still left in uncertainty their
structure and exact age are wholly unknown moreover the betic
chain remains still unexplored from the structural point of view
with due recognition of the limitations actually known the orientation
ol the outcropping strata in the centre and northwest is
different from that in the regions of the pyrenean catalonian
and betic ranges in the centre and north west the
outcropping strata silurian for example are aligned nearly southeast and
northwest in the pyrenean catalonian and bftic chains on the
contrary the outcroppings in the main follow the direction of
the moun tain ridges chainons and are oriented approxi mately
southeast by east and north northwest or southwest and northeast
thus we are dealing with systems of corrugations or folds
that are essentially different the southeastnorthwest folds are those of
the mighty crystalline and paleozoic mass of the iberian meseta
the others are those of the bordering chains the pyrenean
catalonian and betic these bor dering chains have a nucelus
formed like the meseta of crystalline and paleozoic rocks but
in addition they possess representatives of al most entire sedimentary
series they belong to the zone of alpine folds they
have had a geologic history extremely different from that of
the meseta and they also differ among themselves one from
the other the pyrenean and catalonian chains showing distinctly special
formations while the betic chain shows types that are general
and seen in the whole mediterranean zone the catalonian chain
strongly resembles in almost all respects the pyrenean but it
probably formed a part in some former epodi of a
migh crystalline mass occupying a portion of the mediterranean until
submerged at an indeterminate period similarly the betic chain appears
to have been partially submerged at the time of those
pliocene movements which accompanied the opening of gthe strait of
gibraltar the mesela is bordered on the south and on
the north by two great transverse inequalities of which the
most striking is the fault of the guadalquivir at present
underlined hy the depression in which flows the guadalquivir river
a gigantic fracture that cut as with a ktiife all
the out cropping strata a happening probably of the same
kind was associated with the profound depression of the ebro
valley but the mesoioic deposits which at different epochs have
overspread the mesela now hide all the northeast part of
the guadalquivir fault and the fracture of the value of
the ebro these deposits are found to be more horizontal
as one proceeds farther toward the interior of the peninsula
on the borders of the meseta they are slightly corrugated
and form the sierra del moncayo and the montes universales
which mark out the northeast border the sierra morena has
no geoloftic individuality the de isions of the guadalquivir and
of the ebro e been filled with tertiary sediments and
the same holds true of the lowest portions of the
mesela the two castiles in consequence of a general uplifting
movement throughout the meseta with reference to the level of
the sea the tertiary sediments upon the meseta have beei
raised until they form riow the high plateaux already described

judge from data supplied by his tory was formerly navigable

important tinges and canalization at two points became necessary the
carlos canal was cut through the delta formed bv deposits
of sand and pro jecting out into the mediterranean the
im perial canal was constructed from a point 40 miles
below zaragoza saragossa to tudela the western slope is from
the hydrographic point of view most important of all since
in this wide zone are found the valleys of the
great rivers miiio duero taio tagus guadiana and guadalquivir the
lastmen tioned has always been of highest value for transportation
and in early historical times it was navigable far beyond
seville even to cordoba or montoro the southern slope is
even narrower than the nordtern and is the least important
of all in a hydrographic sense the rivers of this
slope being characterized by short course and small volume here
we find emptying into the mediterranean the almeria adra guadalfeo
guadalhorce guadiaro and emptying into the atlantic the guadalete with

and forms about which doubt is countries thus if we
reckon at 10000 the number of species of vascular plants
in europe as a whole about 5400 of them exist
in spain 4225 in france about 5000 in italy including
sicily and slightly more than 1600 in england even in
the small province of madrid there are despite the aridity
of its plains approxi mately 2000 species and if we
compare the numbers of the exclusive species we shall find
that 1200 endemic species exist in spain about 22 per
cent of the vasculars in italy about 300 or about
6 per cent of its flora in france the strictly
indigenous species number about 100 or say somewhat more than
2 per cent we may estimate very closely the affinity
of the spanish flora with that of other lands as
fol lows of spontaneous vascular species in spain 60 per
cent are represented also in the other european floras 25
per cent are very similar to those of northern africa
slightly more than 13 per cent spain possesses in common
with asia with south america not more than 7j4 per
cent with north america less than 3 per cent 24
per cent with tropical and southern africa and with oceania
only about five species per mille fauna like that of
all the rest of the palmare tic mediterranean subione the
fauna of spain is extensive and extremely varied a leading
work on the crustaceans entitled ma terials para la fauna
carcinologica de epaiia by sr od6n de buen says that
the mediter ranean region is richer than the celtic north
ern and northwestern in the carcinokigical fauna d francisco garcia
sola in his memoria prepared for the central commission of
fisheries of the navy department calls at tention to the
circumstance that the waters of the east and south coasts
contain many varie ties of fish for the reason that
the mediter ranean is the great natural breedingplace of the
atlantic and perhaps of other more remote seas the number
of specific forms or species of insects in the entire
peninsula is reckoned at more than 160000 the most common
reptiles are vipera latasiei tropidonolus viperinus rhine chis scaians psammodrotntts
hisbanictts and lacerta muratis the avifauna includes par ticularly some
arctic species in the high moun tains great numbers of
maritime and river birds and in the southeast several species
of vultures and falcons mammals are un commonly well represented
in the perisodactyl order by the genus eqwis and by
ruminants of the artiodactyl order the order of cami vora
is represented by the ursus arclos by spanish varieties of
the genus cohts the cants lupus the canis wtlpes etc
forestrv the mountains and many tracts of the tableland are
in general very scantily supplied with trees and a want
of timber both for fuel and economicalpurposes is severely felt
in many quarters tlie finest forests are on the western
oflsels of the pyrenees and in the mountains of asturias
the more remark able trees are the spanish chestnut and
sev eral varieties of oak and in particular the corkoak

aericulture it is remarkable that spain though one of the
moat naturally productive is also one of the least cultivated
of the coun tries of europe more than a third
of the land capable of profitable cultivation is allowed to
lie waste and the system of agriculture pur sued is
far behind that of any other european countrgt the finest
agricultural district is valencia where both rice and corn are
grown far beyond the wants of the actual popula tion
and furnish large supplies to those parts of the interior
which are less favorably situ ated after valencia catalonia murcia
and some of the northern provinces raise the brgest quantities
of grain the more impor tant crops are wheat rice
maize barley and legumes the culture of the vine is
general and great quantities of wine are made both for
home consumption and exportation the alicante a considerable part of
the grapes grown are dried and exported in this state
especially frorn the port of malaga nuts common and pistachio
walnuts and chestnuts grow in such abundance as lo form
important articles of trade in the warmer districts the olive
sugarcane and cottonplant are partially cultivated fruits are extremely abundant
and include in addition to apples pears cherries plums peaches
and apricots the almond date fig orange citron and pomegranate
and in the lower districts of the south the pineapple
and banana hemp and flax are extensively grown in aragon
and galicia and esparto grows in abundance more especially in
valencia and murcia where it is in extensive demand for
making ropes mats baskets etc besides be ing exported the
mulberry thrives well and is largely cultivated for rearing silkworms
in valencia murcia and granada other vege table products are
saffron licorice and barilla much of the higher part of

and draft and is extensively reared in new castile both
it and the ass are gen erally of a very

only in a few districts are cows kept for dairy
greatest perfection in andalusia the favor ite stock is the

celebrated merino breed to which almost all the other breeds
of europe are more or less indebted for im provement

commerce etc in the middle ages the manufactares of spain
particularly along the coasts of the mediter ranean were in
a flourishing condition and found an extensive demand particularly in
the levant and other parts of the east with the
expulsion of the moors the branches which they had specially
fostered sunk rapidly into decay and have never been revived
new de mands however arose in the west and spain
as the mother country reserving to herself the sole supply
of the colonies was able for that purpose alone to
carry on a number of lucrative manufactures the loss of
these colonies putting a sudden slop lo the demand was
followed by their almost as sudden ex tinction the circumstances
of the country since have been the most unfavorable that

educational syatem the pres ent spanish school system dates from
1900 the centres of education are divided into three categories
primary secondary or preparatory and superior or university tlie first
is sup plied by the municipalities or by licensed pri
vate schools the second is directly controlled by the state
and consists of institutes and pri vate colleges under governmental
supervision the instruction in the preparatory schools con sists of
two sections arts and sciences and the baccalaureate is given
in these institutions and not in the universities the third
class is made up of the universities all supported by
the stale in the larger cities moreover are normal collets
commercial and language schools and mstitutions for the primary in
struction of adults the system is well planned and based
on good laws but the lack of finances makes even
the number of primary schools in adequate in small towns
and rural strict the whole system is under control of
the min ister of public instruction and fine arts spain
is divided into 11 university districts with uniform organization whidi
are in order of rank madrid barcelona granada oviedo salamanca
santiago seville valencia valla dolid murcia and sararossa the largest
is madrid with more than 6500 students at the head
of each university is a president who has charge noi
only of the institution proper but of all the schools
in his district the faculties are presided over by deans
subordinate to the president professors obtain their chairs in competitive
examinations held publicly when a vacancy occurs besides the 10
universities maintained by the state are three controlled by religious
orders but they are not officially recognised and to obtain
credit for his work in these institutions a student has
to pass the pre scribed examinations in the state universities
in the near future the temmenl is to estab lish
another university in the canary islands now a province of
spain the government institutes or preparatory schools are grouped in
10 sections correspond ing to the 10 universities of the
stale and are further subdivided into provincial or local in
stitutes according to their importance university instruction embraces the five
fac ulties of philosophy and letters sciences law medicine and
pharmacy all of which include several subdivisions theology is not
now taught in the universities although members of the clergy
and religious orders often hold im portant chairs in ihem
all five acuities ex ist and he doctorate is conferred
only in the central university of madrid modem guagcs are
not taught ii certain special schools ihe institutes but ii
french is taught in d google to obtain the doctorate
in medicine seven years study are necessary this is the
longest course the degree of licentiale is conferred after six
years study in law five in pharmacy and four in
the other faculties the doctor ate and the ttceniiaie are
given in all faculties these two are the only university
degrees the former is similar to that given in american
universities while the latter is an intermediate stage between the
american degree of bach elor and master the student must
needs have attained the age of 16 and received the
bacca laureate in arts or sciences before per mitted to
enter the universities as a candidate for a degree the
students are divided into two classes official or free oficial
o libre the olciat students must attend classes and stand
examinations somewhat less rigorous than those given to the students
of the latter class who do not attend classes and
matriculate only for the examinations at the end of the
year the examinations are both oral and writ ten and
a second series have to be passed when the student
applies for his deee this divi sion of the students
into official and free also applies to the institutes of
the stale a student may be ouidal or free at
his option or he may be a free student in
some subjects and official in others or free in all
subjects and attend the class lectures with the permission of
the pro fessor in charge this arrangement exists for the
convenience of the student who receives his instruction from a
tutor or who attends an institution conducted by the church
no dis tinction is made between the sexes in govern
mental schoob and women have never been re fused admittance
to the universities the number of women talcing university courses
however is negligible and in 1914 there were only some
25 in die university of madrid certificates signed by the
examining board of three professors are given to the student
for each subject he passes the three passing grades are
approved honorable mention and excellent and the certificates are marked
accordingly a student who receives excel lent sobresaliente in his
subjects is entitled to the remission of part of his
fees for the following academic year all students official and
free pay about 35 pesetas 665 for each subject in
which they are examined students particularly successful in their university
work are sometimes but not always granted gov ment grants

countries to study since 1910 there has existed a board
of scientific research junia para am pliacisn de eitudios which
connects the work done abroad with the oraauization of new
laboratories in spain and puiilishes works showing the results obtained
this board has started the foundation of halls of residence
for students where an important educational and a certain amount
of scientific work is done this board expends about sooouo
pesetas 154 000 per annum a hall of residence for
women students was opened in madrid in 1916 the government

after the deposition of isa bella 11 a new constitution

inhabitants of spain con sist chiefly of spaniards proper composed
of a mixture of anaent aborigines romans visi goths vandals
and suevi but partly also of three other distinct races
basques occupying the provinces to which they give their name
and forming about of the whole population moors who in
the general expulsion of their countrymen found refuge in several
valleys in the kingdom of granada and the castiles and
whose descendants unmingled with the other inhabitants are still living
there to the numlwr of about 60000 and gitanos or
gypsies d google d google the alhunbn uid si hiqc
who are found diffused over all parts of the peninsula
the spaniards proper to whom only it is necessary here
to advert are of middle stature well formed of a
sallow hue sharp features dark hair and keen black eyes
in diet the spaniards are frugal and tern erate their
wants being thus comparatively ew are easily satisfied and furnish
no strong stimulus to exertion indolence accordingly is a prevailing
vice and the highest ambition gen erallv felt is to
be able to live without doing anytmug in their intercourse
with strangers they are reserved taciturn and stand much upon
their dignity afraid apparently of its be ing encroached upon
by undue familiarity but on finding what they conceive to
be their true place properly recognized they lay aside theit
restraint form strong attachments and become the most agreeable of
companions with their natural indolence there is a strange mixture
of enthusiasm and when their passions are once roused there
are few extravagances or excesses of which they are not
capabtamp in favorable circumstances this part of their char acter
has often manifested itself in chivalric exploits history spain was
known to the greeks and romans as spania hi span
ia and iberia the most ancient inhabitants of spain appealr
to have been the iberians who also extended be yond
the pyrenees into gaul as far as the rhone to
these afterward were joined cer tain tribes of celts who
succeeded in making a settlement for themselves in the country
after sanguinaiy contests with the aborigines in process of time
the two races were amalgamated into one and went under
the common appella tion of celtiberians these occupied princi pally
the high tabieiand in the centre of the country the
other parts were occupied by tribes of iberians and celts
who had never in termingled pure iberian tribes from whom
are descended the modern basques were to be found in
the pyrenees and on uie coasts while the unmixed celts
inhabited the northwestern comer of the country corresponding to modem
galicia the phcenicians were the first civilized nabon who made
a descent on the peninsula and founded settlements theie somewhat
later the greeks made their appearance and among other colonies
founded suntum but more ifflpcrtant than any of these were
the colonies established by the carthaginians the history of spain
indeed only properly begins with the carthaginian invasion about 238
bc previous to that almost all that was known of
the coun try was the existence of the two commercial
states of tartessus and gades both in the west the
former of these supposed lo have been the tarshish of
scripture was much visited by phltmidan ships by reason of
its mineral wealth after the first punic war the carthaginians
began lo establish themselves in spain lai tracts of territory
were brought under their sway by hamitcar 238229 and again
by has drubal 228221 and among the cities founded by
them was new carthage the modem car thaena which soon
became a celebrated em ponum the subjected territory extended as
far north as the iberus ebro pressed by the carthaginians
the greek colonies of sagun tum and unporife applied for
aid to the ro mans who already had had their
jealousy roused by the successes of their great rival the
romans interfered and a treaty was then con cluded between
the two eat powers in terms of which the carthaginians
imund themselves not to extend their conquests beyond the iberub
the city of saguntuni was on the west side of
the river but under roman protection and the capture of
it iy hannibal in 219 was the imme diate cause
of the second punic war which was partly carried on
in spain and which in 206 caused the total expulsion
of the carthagin ians from the peninsula thc romans now
un dertook the subjugation of the entire country but in
this they did not completely succeed until after a war
of about 200 years duration in wtiich the exploits of
the lusitanian viriatfaus the heroic resistance and final downfall of
nu mantia 133 and the temporary independence of a part
of the cotmtry under the gallant seto rius 8473 form
brilliant episodes the can tabrians asturians and ouier tribes in
the mountains of the north were the last to yield
but were finalw subjugated by auustus and hi generals and
spain was converted into a rimnan province previous to this
the peninsula luul been divided by the romans into two
parts an eastern and a western separated from each other
by the iberus called respectively hispania citerior and hispania ulterior
but augustus made a new division of the country forming
it into three provinces tarraconensis bictica and lusitama tarraconensis and
lusitaaia were erected into imperial provinces and admin istered by
legates while bsetica which sdll re mained for a long
time a senatorial provinc was placed under the authority of
a proconsul invested with civil authority only until the rei
of antoninus pius who granted to all his subjects a
uniform constitution and laws the cities of spain were ruled
by different laws these and other measures made spain one
of the most flourishing provinces of the empire and a
centre of roman civilization some of the most distinguished latin
writers under the empire were natives of sin such as
the two senecas lucan martial quintilian and others christianity was
early introduced into spain and after the conversion of constantine
the great became the dominant religion there the disorganization and
confusii consequent upon the fall of the roman empire facilitated
the conquest of the country by the vandals who made
themselves masters of a part of southern spain which from
them received the name of vandalusia now andalusia the suevi
who established diemselves in i region now known as galicia
and the alans who gained posses sion of lusitania now
portugal these how ever were soon afterward attacked by the
visi goths who after many years struggle succeeded in reducing
the whole peninsula to their sway the vandals of andalusia
unable to withstand them withdrew into africa in 428 and
from 467 to 484 the great euric extended the king
dom of the visigoths by the expulsion of the ramans
and ve them their first written laws while leovild in
585 overthrew the kingdom of the suevi in galicia under
leovigilds suc cessor reccared i the introduction of ihe cath
olic faith in 586 gave the corrupt latin language ihe
predominance over the gothic and after that time the unity
of the spanish nation was maintained by the catholic religion
and the po litical influence of the clergy but after
re taining the mastery of the country for nearly google
380 the visigoths were in their turn conquered by the
arabs or moors of africa who had come across at
the invitation of the family of alaric the latter being
eager to aven theniselves on their countrymen for being passed
over in the election of king king roderic fell in
the seven days battle against tarik at xeres de la
frontera in andalusia in 711 after that the greatest part
of spain be came a province of tne caliphs of
bagdad for some years fter their conquest of spain the
moors held it as a dependency of the prov ince
of north africa but it was afterward 717 governed by
emirs appointed by the ca liphs of damascus the policy
of the spanish etnirs was to extend the moonsh dominion

about the year 756 abd er rhaman i the last
caliph of the dynasty of the ommiades having been driven
from damascus where he was replaced iw the abassides sue
ceeded in overthrowing the government of the latter in spain
and established the independent caliphate of cordova which under abd
er rha man iii and his son hakkem ii who
died in phate rapidly declined for when that event took
place the various governors of provinces de clared themselves independent
and assumed the title of n thus arabian princes reigned
at s a ragossa toledo valencia and seville where not
only the language but also the manners of the moors
ai that time prevailed almost univer sally still the free
exercise of their religion was allowed to the giristians and
also the re tention of their language laws and magistrates
meantime the visigoths who had succeeded in maintaining their independence
in the moun tains of asturia and galicia founded under
pelayo in 718 the kingdom of oviedo the sec ond
successor of peuyo alfonso i the catho lic conquered galicia
with a pati of leon and castile and assumed the
title of king of the asturias the remainder of leon
was con quered by alfonso iii whose son ordoiio ii
transferred his residence to the city of leon and called
his dominion the kingdom of leon 914 the kingdom of
navarre came into existence in the 9th century it formed
a part of the spanish territory of charlemagne ob tained
by ionquest from the arabs and extend ing south of
the pyrenees as far as the ebro near the sources
of the ebro and pisuarga arose even earlier the kingdom
of castile at first a small republic consisting of only
a few towns it appears afterward as a country with
a considerably enlarged territory and somewhat later its princes assumed
the title of king in 1037 after the death of
the last king of leon ferdinand i of castile united
that kingdom with his own and castile was henceforth the
most powerful spanish stale aragon galicia portugal murcia and other
states owed their origin to the prevailing custom of dividing
a kingdom among the sons of a deceased mon arch
though frequently at war with each other the christian princes
generally united against their common foe the moors who were
daily becoming less able lo cope with them about the
dova and seville appli ury 1 ied f alfonso vi
of leon and castile to the almorav idcs the founders
of the empire of morocco in compliance with the request
of mohammed the almoravides entered spain and gained some successes
over alfonso but they then turned upon mohammed himself obliging
him to yield them a portion of his territory and
the almo lavide sovereign was ultimately acknowledged sole monarch of
mohammedan spain the al moravides however were overpowered in their
turn by another mohammedan tribe the almo hades about the
middle of the 12th century meanwhile the christian kings were
making still further encroachments on the territory in possession of
the mohammedans and after the great victory they obtained over
the almohades on the plains of tolosa in the sierra
morcna in 1212 there remained to the arabians only the
kingdoms of cordova and granada and even these were soon
afterward obliged to rec ognize the supremacy of castile the
two most important christian states of spain were ara gon
and castile and they ultimately absorbed all the others aragon
which had been wrested from the moors by sancho iii
and left as an independent kingdom to his son ramiro
fell by inheritance in 1131 to the counts of catalonia
and was afterward greatly enlarged under suc cessive kings layme

island after the massacre of sicilian vespers see sicilian vespers
in 1282 jayme ii effected the conauest of sar dinia
in 1326 and alfonso v united naples with his kingdom
meanwhile the internal affairs of the kingdom had been thrown
into confusion through dvil dissension resulting from the heavy imposts
laid upon the people but a rem edy was found
in increasing the pojer of the cortes aragon was the
first christian state in which the third estate obtained a
legal position the cortes consisting of representatives of the nobibty
of the clergy and of the towns re ceived more
extensive privileges and the kit could not act in important
matters without their consent on the extinction of the catalonian
line of princes ferdinand infante of castile was elected king
by the cortes in 1412 and his isabella of castile
christian spain was consoli dated into one kingdom ferdinand i
second of sancho was the first king of castile in
waged successful war with the moors took sev eral towns
and exacted tribute from the mo hammedan idng of toledo
it is to this reign that the greater number of
the exploits of the famous rodriguez diaz de fiivar known
under the name of cid belongs and according lo viardot
the establishment of the cortes dates from the same reign
under alfonso vi cas tile acquired an accession of importance
through the annexation to it of the crowns of leon
which had become again disunited galicia and navarre and above
all through the con iiest of toledo and its territory
out of which was formed new castile notwithstanding the success
of its arms the country suffered much oppressed by taxes

though some losses were also sustained to the lallcr prince
is due the introduction of the third estate into the
tiational assemblies and the adoption of the vernacular for public
acts alfonso xi 1324 50 like his predecessors spent most
of his time in warring with the moors he gained
in 1340 the celebrated battle of satados and made himself
master of ateesiras in 1344 in 1465 henry iv was
deposed by his turbulent vassals and the crown given to
isabella whose marriage with ferdinand of aragon in 14 led
to such important results the marriage of these two sovereigns
did not lead immediately to a com plete coalescence of
the two kingdoms for they retained the separate administration of
their re spective dominions but in concert with their great
minister cardinal xinienes they pre ceeded harmoniously with the work
of fusing all the states of spain which still differed
in religion customs and laws into a political and ecclesiastical
unity at the same time seeking to strengthen the royal
authority at the expense of the clergy the aristocracy and
the towns b a severe admini si ration of justice
and by the in stitution of the santa hcrmandad or
holy brotherhood a body of about 2000 police armed and
mounted for the purpose not only of putting down the
robberies and violence which everywhere abounded but also of form
ing a check on the power of the nobility order
was established throughout the country the rojtil power was moreover
strengthened and extended by the establishment of the in suisition
qv warfare also was carried on y ferdinand against the
moors of granada which undertaken in 1481 culminated 10 years
later in the reduction of the capital of that idngdom
which surrendered to ferdinand 25 nov 1491 with the fall
of granada fell the moslem empire in spain after having
existed nearly seven centuries and a half and spain with
the exception of navarre was now con solidated into one
great kingdom an order was issued 30 march 1492 for
the expulsion of all jews who did not submit to
he baptized whereupon nearly the whole race rather than sacrifice
their religion to their worldly interests left the country in
this sentence of banish ment the moors were also included
and the departure of the industrious jews and moors proved
a fatal blow to the flourishing com mene of the
country which was further af fected by the discovery of
america by colum bus in 1492 this being the means
of withdraw ing much of the activity of the nation
from the improvement of the mothercountry while spain consummated its
complete political con solidation at home by the conquest of
navarre the conquest of naples by gonsalvo and still more
the occupation of large portions of north central and south
america by spanish generals soon raised the new kingdom to
the front rank of european powers ferdinand was succeeded in
1516 by his grandson charles i charles v of germany
who permanently united castile and aragon see charles v at
the begin ning of his reign serious insurrections broke out
in valencia aqd canle where the people demanded a more
liberal constitution but ihey were soon fuelled and resulted in
the abolition nf the principal rights of the towns the
restric tion of the powers of the cortes and a
stronger attachment of the clergy and nobility to the crown
the victory of the spaniards at pavia 24 feb 1525
which made francis i the prisoner of charles and the
expedition against tunis and algiers extended the fame of the
spanish arms throughout euroje but these wars to gether with
those earned on against the prot estants of germany against

the demands of the royal treasury and though the taxes

measures taken by olivarei the able mimster of that monarch
the wars which were carried on in germany italy the

and the occupation of the place put an end to
the war the cortes had already held its first session
and had resolved that ferdinand vii should swear to preserve
the constitution before he should be recognized as king at
their invita tion ferdinand now returned to spain but de
clared the constitution null and void the in qtiisition was
revived despotism was restored and the greater part of the
reforms introduced under charles iii were subsequently annulled ferdinand bore
down all opposition with 25 changes in the ministry mostly
sud den and attended with severities they were produced by
the influence of the camarilla or persons in the personal
service of the king every attempt to save the state
was frustrated by such counsellors and the prestige of spain
was further lowered by the loss of the ameri can
colonies an attempt lo reconquer which only resulted in a
miserable failure on 1 jan 1820 a military insurrection under
riego broke out for the purpose of restoring the constitu
tion of 1812 it spread with great rapidity several generals
as odonnell and freyre who were dispatched to suppress it
joined the in surgents and ferdinand abandoned w his own
troops was obliged to swear to observe the constitution of
1812 among other reforms the inquisition was abolished the cortes
being assembled immediately set themselves to frame such measures as
should be calculated lo re store tranquillity to the distracted
country but this was a task well nigh impossible under
the circumstances the country was divided into opposing factions those
who favored the restoration of its ancient power and privileges
to ihe crown and those on the other hand who
advocated liberal or ultra liberal measures and the measures passed
had no effect in allay ing the discontent guerrilla bands
were or ganized in the provinces in the cause of
church and king and obtained the name of armies of
the faith there was even established at seo durgel in
july 1822 what was called a regency during the captivity
of the king the govern ment however was powerful enough
to dis perse these guerrilla bands and drive the regency
into france in these civil disturbances dreadful atrocities were committed
on both sides in the meantime france at the congress
of verona in october 1822 had agreed with the courts
of eastern europe upon an armed inter vention in spain
the spanish government was called upon to restore the royal
sovereignty and to change the constitution and when they de
clined 10 comply a french army 100000 strong under the
ehike of angouleme crossed the pyrenees in the spring of
1823 by means of this force ferdinand was restored to
absolute power and immediately revoked all the decrees passed by
the constitutional government be tween march 1820 and october 1823
the in quisition indeed was not restored but the secu
lar tribunals supplied its place and performed deeds of vengeance
of the most atrocious de scription the whole spanish army
wa5 now disbanded and its place supplied hy the army
of the faith who plundered and murdered the constitutionalists to
their hearts content it is d google mpuied that 40000
constitutionalists chiefly of the educated classes were thrown inio prison
to restrain the violence of party fury a treaty bad
been concluded with france stipulating for the maintenance of a
french force of 45000 men in die country until the
spanish army could be organized it was only in 1827
that the french evacuated spain the personal moderation of the
king toward the constitu tionalists led to the formation of
a plot by the absolutists to compel him to abdicate
and to raise don carlos his brother to the throne
thence their name of cariiilas several in surrections were set
on foot by these carlists which were attended with numerous
executions in 1830 ferdinand was persuaded by his wife uaria
christina a neapolitan princess to abol ish by the pragmatic
sanction of 29 march the salic law of the bourbon
family which ex cluded the daushters of the king from
the throne in consequence of the algtolition of this law
the succession passed from don car los to ferdinands daughter
the infanta isabel don carlos and his party protested against
this measure and the death of ferdinand in 1833 was
the signal for civil war isabella was at once acknowledged
by the leading powers of europe and proclaimed without opposition
in all the midland and southern provinces of spain it
was otherwise in the north particu larly in the basque
province there the in habitants took up arms in behalf
of don carlos and proclaimed him king under the title
of charles v christina had the joint support of the
moderados and the liberals and in order to attach them
to her still more a royal decree was issued in
april 1834 granting a constitution with two chambers the carlists
under the command of ziunalacarreguy were at first suclt cessful
hut on his death their cause began to decline and
the skilful leadership of cabrera failed to retrieve the fortunes
of the party during this struggle england and france al
lowed men to be recruited within their terri tories for
the cause of the queen and an army of 10000
went from england to join the royal troops the chief
of the royalist generals were espartero and odonncll under whose
leader ship the war was brought to an end in
1840 though the civil war had thus been brought to
a successful termination spain had by no means been restored
to a stale of tranquillity chris tina failed to satisfy
the ultra liberals and rather than consent to have a
colleague in the regency as it was now thought expedient
she should have resigned 12 oct 1840 and sailed for
france in may 1841 the cortes conferred the office of
regent on kspaitero and that of guardian to the queen
on arpuelies espartero seems to have had the good of
his country at heart but he had a most difficult
role to play every reform which he attempted gave offense
to some party and to whatever side he turned he
met only with opponents numerous resolute and influential insurrections broke
out in vari ous quarters and espartero checked and ham
perea on all hands at last left the country and
sailed tor england queen isabella was de clared of age
by the cortes in 1843 and hence forth the government
was carried on in her name she was married on
10 oct 1845 to her cousin don francisco dassiz her
only sister louisa being on the same day married to
lotiis philippes son the ijukc of hontpensier the outbreak of
the french revolution of 1848 caused much less commotion in
spain than in several other continental states any revolu tionary
movements that took place were easily repressed by narvaez a
minister of prudence and energy who was then at the
head of the government narvaez however found no small difficulty
in maintainine his position the court was a mere focus
of intrigue and the most important political changes were con
stantly threatened to be effected by the most frivolous and
contemptible means early in 1851 he was compelled to resign
and till 1854 a number of shortlived and weak ministries
most of which had reactionary tendencies suc ceeded each other
at the head of the last of them was sartorius
whose measures were so unpopular that insurrection broke out in
vari ous quarters and he and his colleagues after trying
in vain to suppress them were obliged to s3ve themselves
by flight on the 17th of july 1854 espartero who
had some time before returned to spain was how charged
with the formation of a government in accordance with the
wishes of the nation before consenting to undertake this task
he made two stipulations the one that the queenmother should
be exiled the other that the constituent cortes should be
assembled on obtaining these concessions he formed a coalition ministry
himself holding the ofhce of president and general odonnell that
of minister of war the coalition ministry did not howeer
work harmoniously and esfkir lero after holding his position with
some diffi culty till 14 july 1856 was obliged to
give place to another ministry with odonnelt at its head
which only existea three months narvaer was now called to
the head of affairs october 1856 but in july 1858
odonnell was n entrusted with the formation of a ministry
which being more liberal than the previous ones endured for
a period of five years during which spain enjoyed comparative
tranquillity in 1858 spain snared in the french expedition against
anam to avenge the persecution of catholic missionaries and native
christians which had been going on for a series of
years on 22 oct 1s59 war was declared against mo
rocco which it was alleged had attacked the spanish possessions
situated on the northern coast of that state under the
leadership of odonnell it was carried to a successful con
clusion and a treaty of peace was signed on 26
april 1860 in terms of which 20000000 piastres were paid
to the spaniards by way of indemni fication these foreign
wars led to a consider able increase of the array
and navy promoted peace at home and greatly raised the
reputation and influence of spain abroad in 1860 an tin
successful attempt was made to overthrow the government of isabella
by the count of monte molin the eldest son of
don carlos in whose favor the latter had in 1845
abandoned his claim to the spanish throne in 1861 spain
joined britain and france in sending an ex pedition to
mexico to obtain redress of griev ances the same year
spain resumed jjossession of her former colony of santo domingo
on 18 march the last president of that republic santana
issued a proclamation announcing the union of that state with
spain and on 20 may the queen signed the decree
by which the an d google s3t oexation wai accepted
in 1863 howevr a revolt broke out and atter some
fighting which continued into the oilowing year spain re linquished
the possession once more a quarrel at ihis time broke
out between spain and peru in consequence of which the
spaniards seized the chincha islands by way of material guaran
tee but in the early part of 1865 the differences
between the two governments were adjusted and the oiincha islands
restored to the peruvian authorities a more serious rupture took
place in the same year with ckile which led to
a war btiween the two countries the chileans were supported
by peru ecuador and bolivia but spain had not very
much to fear from this combination though 3i the same
time as might have been expected the war procured her
little dther of honor or profit a tnilitary insurrec tion
broke out in spain toward the cad of 186s under
the leadership of general prim but he and his adherents
were forced to flee before the royal troops prim effected
his escape to portugal but in the following year another
at tempt at insurrection was made on 22 june a
regiment of artillery quartered in madrid mutinied in their barracks
and after murdering several of their officers marched through the
streets of the city calling upon the people to rise
in the name of prim and the republic the active
measures however of the prime uinister marshal odonnell soon put
down the revolt an equally abortive rising though on a
larger scale took place in august 1867 in aragon catalonia
valencia and elsewhere where bands of armed men made their
ap pearance and were in some instances joined by the
mayors of towns and other functionaries the movement in a
short time wholly collapsed and several persons engaged in it
were taken prisoners aod executed but the revolution of 1668
had a very different issue the conduct of the queen
had alienated all feelings of loyalty in the breasts of
her subjects the forms of the constitution had been abused
and made the machinery of arbitrary and oppressive rule and
the people were weary of a system which re pressed
all freedom of thought and rights of conscience which placed
the education of the young in the hands of jesuits
and under which they had lost all respect for their
minisiers and all attachment to the crowtt in the month
of april insurrectionary movements broke out in catalonia and the
province was placed in a state of siege in july
several spanish generals were arrested by the government and without
any form of trial sent into exile the revolution burst
forth in september on the i7tb of that month general
prim arrived at cadu where the exiled generals also arrived
two days later and immediately lent themselves to the move
ment meanwhile a proclamation had been is sued calling he
people to arms marshal ser rano formerly president of the
senate placed himself at the head of the moveraent and
the whole of andalusia pronounced for the revolu tion the
spanish ministry resigned and gen eral concha was appointed by
tne queen presi dent of the council the marquis de
novaliches commanded the royal army and marched upon cordova which
was occupied by the insurgents at burgos a severe conflict
took place which resulted in the royal troops fraternizini with
the people juntas were established in the dif ferent owns
which one after another raised the flag of rebellion the
defeat of novaliches at puerta alcalen and the formation of
a pro visory junta at madrid determined isabella to flee
ihe country and take refuge in france immediately after her
flight the fall of the bourbons was solemnly proclaimed and
one of the first acts of the juntas was to
reccniie universal suffrage as a principle of the future constitution
serrano entered madrid at the head of the revolutionary troops
on 3 october and was received with the utmost enthusiasm
by the inhabitants a few days later a pro visional
ministry was formed to lead the na tion to liberty
and not allow it to perish in anarchy decrees were
passed suppressing the society of the jesuits declaring the absolute
freedom of primary education and restoring the liberty of the
press thus was accomplished with little violence and less bloodshed
a revolution which marks one of the most im portant
eras in spanish history the cortes of 1868 declared for
the monarchical form of government but it was no easy
task to find a prince both able and willing to
fill the hazardous post of king after fruitless nego viths
n the c of hohenzouem led indirectly to the disastrous
francogerman war qv of 1870 the crown was at length
ac cepted by amadeus the second son of victor emmanuel
and on 16 nov 1870 he was for mally elected
as king by the cortes mean while insurrectionary movements in
several of the provinces had disturbed the peace of the
country but were forcibly suppressed the new constitution was promulgated
6 june 1869 and serrano appointed regent until a king
was elected the two years reign of amadeus i failed
to give peace to the much disturbed country parlies were
numerous and irrecon cilable one ministry had to give place
to another each successive change making mat ters worse instead
of better to cr9wn all in april 1872 the carlist
insurrection which had been for some lime threatening burst forth
risings took place simultaneously under old chiefs of the party
in arason navarre and the basque provinces and bands also
rapidly formed in leon castile and elsewhere the cry of
viva carlos vip was heard on all sides no time
was lost by the government in dispatching marshal serrano to
the scene of action he succeeded in driving the insurgents
before him and coming up with the main body on
4 may at oroauieta defeated them the check they received
was however only temporary as they still kept up a
species of errilla warfare and the year 1872 closed amidst
widespread con fusion in the provinces and excitement in the
capital itself the carlists in the north the federalists in
the south overran the country exacting contributions cutting the railways
and telegraph wires inflicting heavy damages upon he slate and
on private families putting a stop to all commercial intercourse
undermining local trade protecting and facilitating smuggling and obtaining unlimited
authority wherever they wenl and in this state of disorganization
the country continued long after all active fighting had ceased
disaffection in the army added to the strife of parties
and the many opposing manifestations of public opinion at length
dc google termined the king to resign a crown the
wear ing of which had caused him nothing but anxiety
and unrest he accordingly abdicated as it on 11 feb
1873 and immediately thereupon the a cortes by a majority
of voles declared for a ical republic which was officially
proclaimed at madrid on 16 february this was followed by
political complications of the most chaotic de scription a state
of affairs which the carlists were not slow in taking
advantage of not only however were the carlisis active but
other insurrectionary movements consequent on the general disconlenl combined to
complicate the difficulties of the government on 8 june the
form of government which had been the subject of much
dispute was by an almost unanimous vote of the cortes
definitely de clared to be that ot a federal republic
the ministers under it were as shortlived as previ ously
on 21 september castelar who at that time was president
was invested with dictatorial powers by a resolution of the
cones who voted their own suspension till 3 jan 1874
ai the expiration of that period matters were in no
way improved public opinion was wholly dis organized and the
carhst war had gained formidable dimensions january 3 saw another
revolution of government the cortes had re assembled and on
a motion being made for the approval of castelars exercise
of authority during the recess it was negatived by a
large majority castelar at once presented the resig nation of
himself and cabinet as soon as this event was known
out of doors general pa via the captaingeneral of madrid
at the head of his troops entered the chamber and
forcibly dissolved uie cortes and having asbemhied the chiefs of
the revolution of 1868 and leading men of all political
parties justified his con duct by the urgency of the
case and desired them to form a new coalition ministry
the parties now placed in power with serrano at their
head were the same with those who made the revolution
of 1868 and the constitution of 1869 during this new
revolution madrid re mained tranquil but in saragossa barcelona and
valencia volunteers were arrayed by the communal authorities against the
troops of the government and barricades were raised the struggle
however was of short duration and soon quelled within 10
days after the in auguration of the new government a
striking mihtary success in the capture of carthagena from the
disaffected came to give it credit in the north ihe
carlist war still raged and be came more and more
formidable bilbao made a stubborn resistance to the government troops
bnt ultimately fell and this success was fol lowed by
a few others but at the battle of estelta fought
on 27 june the carhsts obtained a signal victory over
the republicans who lost nearly 5000 men in killed wounded
and prison ers the carlists now overran the northeastern provinces
the fortresses only holding out against ihcm on is july
after a terrible bombardment cuenca fell into their hands by
the beginning of september the pretenders troops had entered several
towns in different parts of spain thou thqy had been
for the most part unable to retain their acuisittons the
tide of success however again turned against the carlists they
met with a signal defeat near pampcluna on 25 september
and again at irun on ii november but the repub
licans failed to follow up their successes or act if
they had any desire to bring the war to gtedy
conclusion meanwhile another polit change was in contemplation the al
fonststs or advocates of the prince of asturias son of
the excueen consisting of a large ma jority of the
middle and uijper class of sodety had been working steadily
in his interests on the princes 17th birthday addresses had
been presented to bim at sandhurst in england where he
was pursuing his military studies as cadet and on the
last day of the year it was announced that gen
martinez campos pro claiming prince alfonso as king had entered
valencia with two brigades on the same day be was
proclaimed in madrid under tbe title of alfonso xil on
9 june 187s the new king landed at barcelona and
assumed the govern ment ot spain the carlist rebellion dragged
itself on for more than a year after this event
but with fainter and fainter hopes of success on 22
feb 1876 five battalions of carlists surrendered at tolosa to
general campos and four days later don carlos fled to
france on 20 march following the young king made a
triumphal entry into madrid spain enjoyed a time of peace
until his death in his 29th year november 1885 his
wife christina of austria was proclaimed regent after the birth
in 1886 of her posthumous son who is now king
under the title of alfonso xiii besides her struggles with
the carlists and others at home spain had to contend
from 1868 to 1878 and again from 1895 onward against
insurgents in cuba where rebellion seemed almost the normal state
of affairs the united states intervened in 1808 and war
ensued resulting in the defeat of spain the almost complete
destruction of her navy and the loss of her american
and asiatic colonies see uniteb states war with spain the
loss of the protected cblonial markets greatly dislocated manufacturing in

latter in regard to morocco in 1908 both nations handled
the moroccan question in amity the years 190809 were marked
by anarchistic activities a revolution was initiated at barcelona which
was soon sup pressed and its leader francisco ferrer exe
cuted in 191012 many internal reforms were instituted and spains
relations with the vatican placed on a more explicit basis
a measure of religious liberty to denominations other than catholics
was also enacted spain succeeded in maintaining her neutrality throughout
the world war of 191418 although the feeling in spain
was sharply divided the aristocracy and wealthy classes and a
militaristic roup sided with the central powers while the intellectuals
and the great majority of tbe population took the part
of france and the entente the carlisis d google were

and was succeeded by the prieto ministry which lasted until
9 june 1917 when its fall was brought aboui by

mcdonnell spain american diplomatic relations with american relations with spain
which have never been really cordial were largely in fluenced
in the beginning by inherited traditions of anglospanish wars of
two centuries in the revolution spain withheld from alli ance
with the united states and in negotiations for peace planned
to restrict the united slates to territory east of the
appalachians after 1783 she still hoped to obtain control of
the trans appalachian west by restrictions on amer ican commerce
on the lower mississippi and dis puted with the united
stales the northern boundarj of florida concerning which the united
slates had a separate understanding with great britain in 1795
however she was in duced to grant a deposil of
american commerce at new cjrleans and to recognize the american
contention by agreeing to the northern florida boundary at 31
in the two decades closinj in 1815 spain acted with
france in the spoliation oe american shipping especially in the
west indies result ing in later american claims for compensation
another source of irritation and diplomatic negotiation arose from the
secret transfer of louisiana to france in 1801 and the
later ac quisition from france by the united states in
1803 in 1802 jetterson offered to guarantee to spain her
trans mississippi territory for a cession of the island of
new orleans after 1803 he claimed west florida to the
perdido as a part of louisiana and by 1806 established
a customs district therein in the face of spanish protests
in 1810 the american government under madison took possession of
all west florida which had declared its independence and later
extended jurisdiction farther east into territory over which spain was
unable to pre serve order or to perform her international
obligations in 1814 during the war of 1812 jackson temporarily
occupied pensacola after driving out a british force which had
occupied the place without the consent of the spanish authorities
later in 1818 he again ignored spanish sover eignty in
this region by a defensive invasion which doubtless hastened the
completion of negotiations which resulted in a treaty of 1819
ratified 22 feb 1821 providing for ac quisition of florida
by the united states and limits to spanish western territory
by a bound ary established from the sabine northward to
the red up the red to 100 longitude thence north
to the arkansas and up the arkansas to its head
thence north to 42 and thence west to the pacific
still another source of friction was the re volt of
the spanish american provinces begin ning in 1810 and resulting
in a period of privateering in which americanbuilt vessels lueliy
participated under the fla of the re volting governments the
american govern ment recognized the revolted provinces as bellig erents
and sent special agents to report con ditions but maintained
neutrality finally in march 1822 after the ratification of the
florida treaty it recofiiized the independence of four provinces mexico
colombia buenos aires and chile and in 1823 issued the

through fear of international complications relating to cuba and porto

the chief subject of diplomatic relations thereafter a plan of
guarantee of cuba to spain by the united stales and

recognition of mexico and colombia and adoption of a liberal
system of commerce was considered both at washing ton and
ijjndon in 1823 for two decades after 1625 american policy
practically guaranteed to spain the possession of the islantfon condition
that it should not be ceded to france or eng
land in 1840 and 1843 the american govern ment officially
assured spain of the american policy to maintain spanish occupation
of cuba by american military and naval force against any
attempt to wrest the territory from ner the failure of
the new american policy to purchase cuba by diplomatic negotiations
in 1848 was followed by a period of unsuccessful filibustering
attempts aided by lawless ad venturous americans to encourage revolt
in the islands resulting in various complications and new international
suspicions dechning to accede to an anglofrench proposal of 1851
for joint action to prevent the landing of filibuster ing
adventurers in cuba and also refusing to become a party
to the later proposal of 1852 for a tripartite agreement
disclaiming any pur pose to obtain possession of cuba the
american government under the pierce administration through the influence of
slavery interests adopted a systematic policy of annexation illustrated in
1854 by the incidents of riie black warrinr episode and
the ostend manifesto repudiateo by secretary marcy and finally terminated
only by the new issues of the civil war period
in the american qvil war relations with spain were largely
concerned with the question of confederate plans or operations affecting
cuban neutrality in relation to the use of the island
as a base for enterprises endangering the american union and
the spanish occupation of san domingo which the american government
disapproved and which ceased in 1865 relations again became strained

confidentially sounded the chief european governments in re gard to
their views on a policy of foreign in tervention in
cuban affairs after the pacification of cuba in 1878 span
ish restrictive commercial regulations remained a continual source of complaint
the american government urged spain to establish a more liberal
government through independence or autonomy to adopt a more liberal
commercial policy and to secure better protection of ameri can
citizens and american property in cuba in 1884 and 1886
it obtained promises of the termination of discriminating and retaliatory
duties but the agreements were violated under various pretexts by
the cuban officials in 1891 it was able to negotiate
with spain a reciprocity schedule under which american commerce was
considerably increased in spile of the obstructions of spanish officials

the true sigtuficance of which has hitherlo been overlooked by
art critics that the production of the famous ironwork of
spain trained eye and hand taught marvelous celerity and certainty
of exe cution through many centuries that preceded the 17lh
the moors had expressed with iron as a medium not
only their basic principle of design but also the delicate
and elaborate method they applied to the predoas metals d
google spanish art during the romanesque and early gothic periods
french ironwork also exerted its influ ence in the western
peninsula afterward ital ian renaissance architecture as it was inter
preted and applied in spain gave to the iron worker
such an opportunity for the exercise of his talent that
he achieved grandeur and architectonic quality in his work surpassing
the attainments of ironmasters in other lands and if we
are to appreciate the distin guishing characteristics of such pictures
as the spinners and the meninas painted after the manner
of an instantaneous photograph we must remember that the artistic
ironworker was generally an expert in other arts as well
and sometimes the ancestor of a painter who thus inherited
as did velasquez for example rapidilgt with certainty of execu
tion power in combination with delicacy in this connection we
may cite the following char acterization of the gothic and
renaissance iron work the charm of the gothic cannot be
denied produced as i were by feverish powerful blows delivered
during the brief mo ment that the mass was glowing
hot it is a sort of solidified impressionism and appeals
accordingly this mediaeval spontaneity it is true eluded the more
sophisticated renais sance worker but not the medieval crafts manship
this he retained and added to by his command of
newer processes and his greater knowledge of design till he
had reduced the mightiest of all metals to an atgtedience

when we come to the third and uni versally significant
period of spanish painting painters architects and sculptor the attempt
to trace clear national hnes of devel mnent in the
spanish arts has always been regarded and not without reason
as an ex itcmely difficult undertaking spanish art is indeed
like a river whose current is swollen by many a
stream from as many different lands nevertheless it has characteristics
that ate strikingly often startjingiy individual and distinctive and these
are the characteristics to which we should devote special attention
the difiicuity just referred to has been increased and lnlensiiied
by the unlthie attention that writers have paid to the
numerous foreign ar tists who have been residents in spain
and whose works still remain there to those for eigners
who in spain but not sympathetically of spain neglected or
failed to express in and through the works of art
they created the ibcrianism of the country that sheltered them
and employed their talents it has seemed to us necessary
therefore to prepare a new list of spanish painters architects
and sculptors which should be based upon an independent principle
of selection we omit the names of all who do
not seem to be more closely con nected with the
spanish arts than with those of any other country here

their talents in the following para graphs spanish paintiog the
history of span ish painting falls into three main periods
first the period of the flemish influence second the period
of the italian influence and third the period in which
the spanish genius found itself gaining vastly in the power
of inde pendent artexpression and so with creative artimpulses freed
in a measure from bondage d google spanish art to
foreign schools though never wholly esca ine the tyranny of
national institutions politi cat religious and social finally acquired as
we said above universal significance about the end of the
l5th century or the beginning of the 16th the works
of antonio del rincon at granada and the panels of
fernando gallegos at salamanca and zamora as well as the
easel paintings and panels of the early seville paint ers
juan sinchez de castro and alejo fer nandez most clearly
proclaim the northern in fluences still triumphant throughout the penin
sula as they had been continuously except along the northeastern
littoral and in the ex treme south ever since 1435
or 1440 but the irresistible charm of the great florentine
mas ters was presently to be felt in spain as
in western europe generally a new world of artistic possibilities
was revealed to spanish artstudents voyaging eastward just when span
ish soldiers ana merchantadventurers year after year sailing westward were
engaged in explormg and conquerinif the new world of boundless
material possibilities and so at this point in our study
we come upon a halfcen tnry of inspiring fancystirring spanish
ex periences of a synchronous hazard of new fortunes in
art and imperial expansion in italy and america by the
middle of the century or just a little while afterward
the oceans and mountains the rivers and naked lands had
been explored and thai fever of daring ven tures abated
by the middle of the century or a little before
the methods and aims and almost not quite the heart
of the italian renaissance had also been explored and by
an altogether dramatic coincidence seville rather than any other spanish
city received italys new messe and more than the other
cities appreciated it at the very lime when she was
receiving at her tower of gold all the amazing shipments
of americas treasure somewhat before the days of luis de
var gas the italian influence became potent at se ille
and for more than two generations or until the close
of the useful career of francisco pacheco its control was
not seriously contested except by juan de las roelas and
francisco herrera the elder in central spain meanwhile the successors
of alonso berruguete strove to pass from hand to hand
the torch their distinguislicd master had kindled at the cinque
cento flame but here the eflorts appear to have lacked
continuity and organiiation at the spanish court the northern tradition
was still far from being dislodged to prove this a
glance at scrupulously conservative portraits painted by alonso sanchez cocuo
and pantoia de la cruz will be sufficient nevertheless the
court was already attentive to the appeal of italian painting
in this instance not the tus can but the venetian
school the superb col lection of venetian pictures at madrid
begun wr charles v and increased by philip ii made
that appeal which became a resistless one when it had
u1us gained the compelling force of pro pinquity now the
renaissance spirit itself bespoke a freer quest of beauty than
had ever before been conceded by spani realism but the
sit uation called for an apostle of freedom and el
greco came domenico theotociipuli el greco by the independent character
of his work at toledo by the originality he probably
advocated and certainly exemplified with won derful success suggested to
other painters as a not unattainable ideal the expression of
per sonality without slavish dependence upon any foreign school whatever
in the manner of its expression as a zealous advocate
of religious and social reforms speaks often overempha sizing bis
values in order to coniince his audience so el greco
painted often forgetting mere truth to nature but fortunately the
early training at venice gave him that command of colpr
and fluency in narration that are in evi dence even
at such moments perhaps espe cially at such moments and
of course the venetian training counted in his favor and
in favor of the acceptance of his novel theories by
many spaniards the reason why such ac ceptance had become
possible has been plainly progressive juan de las roelas and
a bit later that declarant of independence the elder her
rera as above intimated in valencia the italianized francisco ribalia
was the teacher of jacinto jeronimo de esplnosa who dis
elayed independence in the choice of some of is themes
ribalta also it is much more im portant to note
was probably the first instrnc tor of that exceptional pamter
whose gret talent embraced the best characteristics of both spain
and italy jusepe de ribera called lo spagnoletlo it is
not too much to say that ribera added constructive reality
to theotoco pulis inspiring but vague theories and ideals of
freedom and the free expression of per sonality the toledan
has predisposed now ribera disposed showing to all the definite
sure path that led to greatness through the en noblement
not through the abandonment of the realistic bias of the
national propensity to ward realism and so we place together
the names el greco and lo spagnoletlo the greek said
find a way the little span iard said this is
the way together in this sense they usher in the
third period estremadura ve to spain and the world francisco
zurbaran realist unequaled porlrayer of monastic types cordova a number
of naturalistic painters to the latter school be longed antonio
de saavcdra y castillo and his pupil juan de valds

sentative of the school of granada at the be ginning
of this period are alonso cano who nad previously devoted

pupils or it may be only his most able immediate
suc cessorsjuan de sevilla and fray atanasio sumamed bocanerra but
the school of se ville gave to spain and to
the world rarlolomi esteban murillo and diego velazquez or velasquez
the latter signed his own name and distinctly enough in
1650 dd that is diego de silva velasqttee his mothers
family name was velazquez but he substituted s for the
first a at that time for our present purpose it
is less essential to describe murillo and velasquez as the
freatcst of spanish painters than to realize ow differently they
were affected by the 17 century influences at seville the
new move ment favoring freedom in choice of subject and
realism in its treatment while the old repres sive ecclesiastical
policy discouraged such free cii v google spanish aht dom
two striking passages in mr tiylers book see bibhography show
that writers clear apprehension ol the dissimilar manifesta tions there
in sevime sat paeheco appointed censor by the inquisition proclaiming
that the ode aim of an was to excite men
to de votion murillo seems to have had a temperament
that naturally expressed itself through pious subjects thus there was
nothing in the air of seville thai made it stifling
for him but what of men like herrera el moio
and valdes leal they both had detestable characters and great
aptitude especially the latter but lth century seville which was
so pleasant to zurbaran and murillo drove them to every
son of bitter excess and again the turningpoint in the
career of the sdiool was reached when the twentyyearold vdazquei
went to madrid though his master paeheco was a pedant
he seems to have been a friend to an after
hk own manner and there were enough painters in the
andalusian capital to have kept a brilliant school alive had
it not been for the exaprgeraied atmosphere of devotion that
prevailed thei e whether velazquez would have become the man
we know had he stayed there instead of travelling in
italy is open to grave doubts at any rate the
atmosphere of seville was too close for him he went
to coun and those who stayed had 10 devote themselves
to religious subjects or starve velazquez was able to paint
as he pleased at madrid professor carl justi has made
the correct observation that murillo was originally as essentially a
realist as velazquez but for the simple reason that he
continued to live in a roman catholic provincial town and
painted for conventual churches he had to represent the subjects
that pleased the devout of his day such as the
immaculate conception the visions of the monks cell the mysteries
and ecstasies of asceticism he could not de vote his
entire energy to the reproduction of the mere visual phenomena
he had to depict what was never seen his artistic
greatness the secret of his wonderful success res in the
fact that he recognized the unique character and special charm
of the human nature of southern spain adapted it to
the palette and the brush and ventured to in troduce
it into paintings of religious subjects velasquez after wrenching himself
free from provincialism discovered in himself the very special powers
of another crisl6bal andino that greatest and most honored 16th
century ironworker of burgos seville and toledo let us read
what was wcittcn by bonnal in his preface to berueies
velazquez see biblioa rapky the methods which velazquez em ployed
to obtain such startling results are surprisingly simple armed with
a palette on which only a strictly limited number of
colors appear and with a few long and slender brushes
in his hand he painted in everything at the first
touch the shadows much simpli red are merely rubbed in
and only the high lights are thickly painted and the
whole with its fine gradations of tone is so broadly
and rapidly executed and is so precise in color and
proportion so exact in its values and so true in
drawing that the illusion is complete and the resulting work
a marvel yet it is only proper to say that
bonnat so far as we know had not given thouit
to the analovne or explanation that we have offered at
madrid the contemporaries of velazquet forming the madrid school were

the best single otai at which one can subject works
of architecture of all the spanish architectural periods to direct
and personal observation is undoubtedly the ancient city of toledo
since all such periods are represented in its structures and
represented by good examples but merida in tlie southwest possesses
the most inlcresliag architectural memorials of the roman empire as
asturia in the north possess those of the visigoths during
the roman period imperial public buildings were very numerous in
spain and although comparatively few escaped de struction their massive
diinensions and char acteristic lines exerted an influence in the
dgt google spanish art 347 formation of national taste that
has never been wholly lost again between 414 and 711
the visigothic period anolher controlling in fluence was felt and
this is far from being un worthy of our consideration
inasmuch as amonz all the hordes that invaded spain in
the 5tn century the visigoths natives of dacia the modern
rumania were as mr tyler says al ready christians and
bv far the most advanced in the arts of war
and peace mr c h blackall writes in sturcis r
lta dictionary of architecture and buildings new york and london
1905 that the invasion of tne visigoths appears to have
swept away nearly all the architecture of the roman period
while the conquest by the moors in the early part
of the itury in its turn obliterateci most of the
sjii the visigothic work except in the north then lhe
seat of government being fixed about madrid the renaissance style
which was imported from italy and fostered by constant intercourse
with foreign artists was naturally at its best on the
central plateau in the central portion much of the mediaeval
work disappeared to make room for the renaissance palaces in
the south the moors fonnd htlle to preserve when they
first entered the kingdom and the architectural work that they
themeclves did was of such manifest value that it was
on the whole very little disturbed subsequently we therefore find
the gothic and romanesque chiefly in the north the moor
ish in the south and the neoclassic along the central
plateau the mosque at c6rdova the oldest and lar est
moorish monument in spain founded in is el cristo de
la luz at toledo and in the same city the
casa de mesa and the taller del moro the giralda
tower 1196 at seville the alhambra at granada these are
familiar examples of moorish work before the recon quest the
name mudijar is given to that blending of the christian
and moorish styles which took place after the reconquesl the
romanesque introduced toward the end of the 11th century prevailed
throughout the i2th examples of this are beside that famous
resort of pilgrims in our own day the church of
sautiago de compostela 106096 sani isidro in le6n 10631149 san
pedr6 at huesca 1101241 and the cathedral of lugo 112970
not long afterward the gothic was introduced from france and
as examples we may mention the churches of viruela and
of las huelgas the latter built by ferdinand iii about
the middle of the 13th century but the gothic at
first failed to maintain itself as frenchijlhic in spain i
became spanish gothic actually composite by the union in the
same structure of the new gothic principles with the romanesque
or those of a still older period such are the
churches of salamanca 1178 aad santa maria at benavente 1170
1220 not before the 13th century could the pore perfected
french cathedral style make an irresistible appeal it was adopted
and magnificenlly own then in the cathedrals of burgos 1221
of toledo 1227 and of leon 12sth305 the cathedral at
seville largest ot all lothic churches was founded at the
be ginning of the 15th century the end of the
same century witnessed the erection of build ings of extraordinary
originality and picturesque charm which as professor carl justi writes
mirror that mighty outburst of national feeling which fallowed in
the train of a series of unparalleled events noteworthy among
the structures of this group are the facades of san
gregorio and san pablo at valladolid and of santa cruz
at segovia the renaissance came to spain almost a centurv
later than to italy here the essen tial point of
contact was in the domain of decoration artistic imagination accustomed
to mudjar and gothic ornamentation recog nized in the new
style a new class of motives enlarging its previous range
an important example is the coro of the cathedral of
cor dova although this had been begun in is23 in
the gothic style so suggestive of works in the precious
metals was the new manner of ornamentation that the term
plateresltiue frcnn plalero meaning silversmith was given to it an
honored name among architects at the time was that of
diego de riaiio d 1533 who de signed the sevillan
city ball and portions of the cathedra representatives of a
reaction in favor of severity and restraint advocating the attainment
of more statelv efeects through pro portion alone without decoration
were juan de toledo who began the escorial and tuan
de herrera who completed that huge late renaissance structure in
the 18th century the urrigueresque a style peculiar to spain
and sjtanish colonies ran riot see churri gueita in foregoing
list of painters architects and sculptors and the canons of
classic de sign were disregarded stucco and gilding were lavishly
used says sturgis and broken pediments twisted shafts and contorted
scrolb abound the result is like nearly all spanish work
highly decorative and not without a cer tain theatrical splendor
but it lacks structural reasonableness about tpffil a more academic
style began to displace the churrigueresque best of the 18th
century more academic buildings is the royal palace at madrid
a dignified and wellltbalanced composition in the 19th century and
thus far in the 20lh eclecti cism has been the
rule it has seemed the part of wisdom in a
country so rich in varied tra ditions of art to
reproduce approved old forms rather than minister to the craving
for novelty sculpture in the renaissance period the italian influence
was overwhelming and during many years the marblecutters of the
better class were almost exclusively natives of italy this circumstance
has occasioned general ac ceptance of the theory that during
earlier and later periods as well this or that foreign
influ ence usurped the place lawfully belonging to original spanish
talent we shall try to indi cate the correct limitations
of such a theory in the course of a brief
review of the main essential facts and first we must
realize that native works of great merit such as those
of pedro of tar ragona in the tarragon cathedral date
from 1426 1434 and so on that bartolomes apostles at
the main door of the same cathedral date from 1278
and that the apostles door at the cathedral of burgos
was also executed in the 13th century in other words
spain did not wait for the coming of the italian
renaissance or for its longdelayed arrival at her shores end
of ae i5th century but on the contrary created ideal
figures portrait statues and what ever was required for the
embelbshmeiit of ig v google 348 spanish broom spanish fort
architectural desien long before italiatrization prevailed frencfi influences are evident
in some of the sculptures of the 13th and 14th
centuries netherlandish influences in some of those of ihc 15th
century but an art critic should not fail to observe
the relatively small number of those sculptures which belong lo
the schools mentioned and may properly be called foreign products
he will perceive spanish realism with its directness and forcefulness
of exfiression stamping as iberian the ast ma jority of
early sculptures down to or even be yond the middle
of the isth century gil de si loe toward the
end of that century produced such sculptures as the monument
in honor of bishop alonso de cartagena at burgos and
the wellknown works al palencia and in the car tuja
de miraflores a few ears afterward however the supremacy of
italian sculpture was recogniied bariolome ord6nez frankly em ployed italian
assistants and was working with them at carrara when he
died 1520 alonso bermguete who returned from italy in the
year of ord6iiez death was a versatile artist whose impulse
on rare occasions to regain originality led to extravagances but
his chief work if we accept professor justis view to
this extent shows how deeply he had steeped himself in
the spirit of michelangelo da mian formenl and dio morlanes
were in spired by italian and classic ideals the period
of complete emancipation ar rived when spanish sculptors chose wood
as a convenient subslitate for stone a period or epoch
during which was accomplished a revo lution in ecclesiastical taste
that is peculiar to spain the enthusiasm for figure sculpture
grew into a marked predilection for bulk and multiplicity of
detail and one result of this was that stonecarving was
practically aban doned and the artist confined himself almost exclusively
to wood pine cedar linden larch as a cheaper and
more easily worked material coloring was not used at first
now arose those huge retabios which cover a choirwall reaching
up to the vaulting with a jacobs ladder of statues
all that had been ex pressed in the 14th and
15th centuries by small painted groups and panels was now
translated into lifesize statues miguel de ancheta made a retablo
containing 35 statues and groups caspar becerra was one of
the most famous sculptors in this medium among casllians in
seville at the beginning of the17th century martinez montatiei in
whose works there is not a trace of the italian
style or indeed of aiiy other foreigii influence led popular
interest in and appreciation of polychrome sculptures whose art is
lhe result of an essentially span ish attitude of mind
while the sense of torm through which it is expressed
is probably pecu liar to seville the polychrome figures did
not however represent the best achievements in this distinctively spanish
phase pedro de mena a sculptor of granada in the
last half of the 17th century carved statues and statu
ettes that reauired no paint to enhance veri similitude the
unpainted small wooden fig ures of saints by this artist
are remarkably original as all critics will admit but they
show more than independence of foreign sdiools they show such
marked superiority that foreign students of art may leam the
fine secret of true characterization by visiting the cathedral at
malaga and copying menas sculp ture there it seems to
us that the story of enfranchised spanish sculpture often wholly
or in a meas ure free and sometimes lawless uiovemably
iberian as in the days of churriguera and those of
francisco zarcillo 170748 aris mendi and ron reaches its true
climax when menas success is recorded a classic reaction of
no genetic value at th beginning of the last century
resembled what took place in france at the same time

of the modern spoken and written forms of latin that
is it is a neolatin or romance language its motherland
is spain in the iberian peninsula besides spanish two sister
romance tongues are in use in the peninsula viz in
the western part portuguese which is never to be regarded
as a dialect of span ish andj in the eastern
part catalan which has affinities to the provencal of southern
france in part of northern spain and in the district
of the pyrenees the native speech is basque which has
no discernitile relationship to its neolatin neighbors spanish and french
and is thought by some to he a survival of
the ancient iberian language in galicia which occupies the northwestern
corner of spanish lerritory the natural idiom is galician and
it is a dialect of portiese in he middle ages
both catalan and talician had literary maiii fesiaiions of no
little importance in spite of school influence which tends to
spread he influence of castilian lo their detriment they continue
to be the popular spoken lanrniages of their districts and
catalan has continued to have its notable writers of both
prose and verse down into our own times in the
strictly spanishspeaking region three dialectal divisions are marked vi 1
cas tilian andalusian in the centre and south of the
land 2 leoneseasturian in the west and north and 3
navarro aragonese in the northeast and east through political import
ance and as a result of various other reasons especially
the greater activity of its writers in the earlier period
castilian soon became the dominant form of spanish and remains
such today the term castilian is often used as the
equivalent of spanish to designate both the language and the
literature some have regarded andalusian as an individual dialect but
it differs so little from castilian one of its most
distinctive traits is its asstbilation of c before e and
i and of z which castilinns pronounce as voiceless interdental
tk that there is little need of giving it a
place apart for literary purposes the navarro aragonese and the
leoneseasturian have never received any extensive or lasting development the
following may serve to illustrate some of the phonological differences
between the two dialects and the standard castilian they both
have a glidesound between e and a following vowel where
castilian has none leyer to read cast uer leyal lojal
cast leal they both have palatalized ii the ti of
enr ksh filial approximates to this sound where castilian has
a j a guttural spirant cf the scotch ck in
loch fiuo son cast hijo ovella sheep cast oveja they
both have it where castilian has ch dereito right cast
derecho midlo much cast mucho the both develop diphthongs out
of accented latin short i and 5 where castilian fails
to do so because of the influence in castilian of
a following palatal putyo height cast poyo latin psdium fuella
leaf cast hffjo latin pi folia etc leonese dianges after
white cast bianco aronese keeps initial latin pi and cl
where castilian changes them to ii plorar to weep cast

have also cer tain traits that distinguish them from cas
tilian thus aragonese tends to create a feminine form in
a for adjectives which are not entitled historically to that
ending dolienle grieving fem dolienta cast dotiente for both genders
leonese uses fuller farms of the definite articles w ela
elos elat cf cast el la lom fau leonese has
tr infinitives where castilian has ir viver jo live dizer

islands from mexico southward for that matter it is still
spoken even in tracts of the united stales eg in
new mexico cali fornia texas etc it followed the spanish
flag to the cajiaries and the philippines with out however
displacing the aboriginal speech in the philippines any more than
it has done so in the parts of america in
which the indians are numerous in spanish america the pro
nunciation reveals traits that once existed in castilian of the
15tb and 16th centuries and have since changed in the
motherland and it shows also features of the dialects of
the por tions of the peninsula whence the settlers came
but to all intents and purposes since the dia lectal
differences operate for only a restricted munher of sounds and
the accepted principles of grammar are those of castilian the
spanish of spanish america is properly enough de nominated by
the generic if somewhat elastic term of castilian the expatriated
moors and jews have taken spanish to places in northern
africa and in turkey where they still speak it in
a more or less contaminated form it is safe to
say that in the neighbor hood of 70000000 human bangs
are today usin spanish in various parts of the world
castilian the standard form of spanish at tained to the
dignity of a literary medium by the 12th century about
or soon after the middle of which there appeared the
noble epic poem e1 cantar de mio cid and the
little liturgical slay el misterio or auto de os reyes
lagos but in legal ecclesiastical and other documents we can
trace its evolution during some five or six centuries prior
to that time from the popular latin of the more
or less illiterate soldiery and colonists brought to the peninsula
as a result of the roman conquest by the time
of augustus the conquest had be come an achieved fact
and during the fonr centuries of peace that followed his
reign the romaniaation of the land so thoroughgoing for its
institulions and customs was a practi cally complete process for
its speech also it is dubious that apart from a
very scant number of debatable elements of the lexicon any
ves tiges of the idioms of the origiiial celtic and
google sfahi8h language iberian tribes remain in the casiilian lanfage
vulgar popular latin is he ali important source of its
lexicon phonology morpholo and syntax in the course o time
its vocabulary has been enriched by accretions from arabic brought
in moorish conquest from 711 on from other european languages
erpeciajly french and italian and from the indian and other
native languages of the colonial settlements phonoloct with the invasion
of the germanic barbarians and the fall of rome in
the early 5th century political contact with italy was severed
and the vulgar latin of hispania began to undergo the
changes in sound that produced ultimately castilian in the high
plateau of the centre of the peninsula in the following
statement of facts we are concerned on with popular developments
words of peculiarly learned use did not neces sarily go
through the popular phonological processes in the vowel system it
is notable that under the accent latin a long and
short i i a a were represented in the vulgar
latin enuncia tion by close variations of the same sounds
ie qualitative distinctkins as between open and close utterance became
important for them as for all vowels latin i became
vulgar latin dose e also and latin s became close
o with their close pronunciations these vowels re mained in
castilian unless affected by some adjoining sound notable a palatal

is one of the dis tinctive features of castilian as
compared with the other leading romance languages french italian and
portuguese for in these laitcr the diphthongization occurred not at
all as in portuguese or only in open syllables as
in french and spanish cf cast fuertc strong with ptg

usually disappeared in the final sjlable it could also disapgtear
after con sonant sounds which the genius of the lan
guage pennits to end a word the consonants of latin
have proved more persistent in the initial position in the
word than elsewhere but a characteristic of cas tilian is
the change of before a vowel but not before the
castilian diphthong ue to old spanish aspirate h still written
in the older stages of uie language in modern castilian

morphology for substantives a great simplification has occurred in the
passage from latin to castilian in that the six cases
of the noun and adjective have been reduced to one
in castilian and this nsually corresponds to the latin accusative
singular and plural latin genitive dative and ablative relations are
ren dered by combinations of prepositions with die dgt google

man larin haminis eta in the personal pro nouns there
are still certain case distinctions jo me me a mi
to me etc there are no neuter nouns in castilian
the latjn neucers become masculines for the most part but
a few become feminine the verb system also shows a
reduction of the complex system of latin inflections but it
still possesses many and varied conjugalional forms the latin passive
voice disappeared its place has been taken by periphrases with
the passive rticiple or by a reflexive or other construction
the latin future indicative tense did not survive it was
replaced by a new form made by adding the present
tense of castilian haber to have to the infinitive of
the main verb amor to love plus he i have
omari i shall love suffixes derived from the imperfect indicative
of haber are used simi larly to form a past
future or conditional on the infinitive of the main verb
as a base cas tilian perfect tenses are formed hw
combining tenses of haber to have with the past par
lidple of the main verb he amado l have loved
the latin imperfect subjunctive was lost but castilian has two
such tenses ending in le and rj in the first
singular of which the one comes from the latin pluperfect
sub junctive and the other from the latin plu perfect
indicative there is a future subjunc tive derived from the
latin future perfect indicative and perfect subjunctive its use has
become greatly limited in recent times con ventionally we speak
of three regular conju tions in castilian denoted usually by
their infinitive endings ar er ir in point of fact
the endings of the er and iv conjucations are the
same for all except four of their many forms so
that the latin four conjugations have virtually been cut down
to two a number of verbs are perfectly regular as
to their endings but show certain variations in their root
vow els they form what are known as the radical
changing classes there are no few irregular verbs sytitax there
are interesting phenomena that mit be considered here but uie
present to spanish language its use of the preposition to
at before a noun denoting a specific per son higher
animal or personified thing and standing in the accusative relation
to a verb 1 see the man is veo al
kotnbre literally 1 see to the man the order of
words in a spanish clause is a very elastic matter
in general the english declarative order of sub ject verb
object is but little adhered to in a simple statement
of fact the verb or the ob ject may begin
the clause so that inversion is frequent in the language

mexico the spanish speaking countries of south america and the
philipihnes it is one of the oldest systems of law
and as at present constituted is a mixture of roman
germanic and arabic elements with marked traces of the influence
of canon law roman law became dominant in spain as
early as 200 ac and retained its supremacy practically until
the conquest of the visigoths after which the germanicaw coexisted
with the roman law there were several codifica tions of
the law before the year 653 the arab conquest of
the 8th century was an important factor in modifying spanish
law about 1265 roman and canon law became prominent then
succeeded several centuries of strufmle for su premacy between the
native and the roman taw the various codes existing at
this time caused great confusion in the positive law and
unsuc cessful attempts were made to simplify it dur ing
the reign of ferdinand and isabella 1490 1 later the
justinian and canon laws spread rapidly throuout many of the
king doms of the peninsula in 1567 a genemi code
was promulgated a peculiarity of span ish legislation is that
no code has ever been promulgated to repeal the old
codes and the result has been difficulty in interpreting the
existent law at the adoption of the constitution of 1876
which is now m force civil commercial crim inal and
military law have been incorporated into separate codes likewise a
judiciary act and codes of civil and criminal procedure have
been adopted in 1910 a commission was ap pointed to
revise and recodify the procedural penal and civil codes and
the judiciary laws the spanish civil code was promulgated by
decree in 1889 and extended to the colonies with corporations
the law of persons i fuardianship law of property contracts
juns iction conffict of laws etc the subject of marriage
was formerly left to the canon or ecclesiastical law but
under book one of the code of 1889 civil marriages
are permissible with the important qualification that all persons who
profess catholicism must celebrnte the canonical form the third book
of this code provides that no private property shall be
taken for public use without due compensation an exact counterpart
of the principle made familiar in the united states by
constitutional provi sions a noticeable feature of the spanish law
in regard to the descent of property and suc cession
makes it illegal for a parent to disin herit legitimate
children twothirds of the estate is thus reserved some criticism
has been aimed at the code of 1889 among others
that it is incomplete as instances it is said to
contain nothing regarding certain prior laws such as those relating
to mines hunting fish eries and civil registry in addition
it leaves questionable the relation of noncastilian legis lations and
the customary law to the civil ctle with the exception
of the subject of marriage this code has only subsidiary
force in the prov inces of aragon catalonia navarre and
the balearic isles the roman law dvil and canon is
still subsidiary law in catatonia gt google spanish law the
commercial code owing to imperative need antedated the civil code
spain is said to have produced the first code of
mercantile law in the ordinances of bilboa 1737 which spread
to america and remained in effect in mexico until 18s4
spain codified commercial law in 1830 the great commercial develop
ment of the country lale in the 19th century emphasized
the need of reform and in 1635 a new code
went into effect which later in the same year was
extended to cuba and porto rico much supplementary legislation has
been enacted in lale years the commercial code treats of
commerce and registry ciat contracts banking railroads i mercantile guaranties
commercial paper commercial civil procedure is governed by the act
or code of 1881 as amended and the judiciary act
o 1870 as amended in 1882 the code of 1881
in amended form was extended to forto rico in 1885
and lo the philippines in 188a procedure in commercial cases
is governed by the code of civil procedure since commercial
courts were aboushed in 1868 the code of civil procedure
which is arranged in three books contains some provisions in
conflict with the civil code which was enacted stibsequently spanish
civil procedure is divided into two classes according to the
nature of the ac tion contentious ccntenciosa and voluntary or
noncon i entious voluntaria voluntary iurisdiclion is used when there
is no contention between the parties but judicial proceedings are
necessary to fix legal rights as in cases of suardianship
administration adoption and the ke this resembles the noncontentious juns
diction of france germany and other countries of europe a
rather remarkable feature of the code is that it provides
for arbitration of civil actions out of court special provisions
are also made in this code for procedure in voluntary
jurisdiction in commercial cases notarial law is of more importance
than in great britain or the united states under spanish
law nearly all deeds contracts and important agreements must be
certified by a military and naval courts of spain have
ampler powers than in the united states the military law
is governed by the code of military justice promulgated in
1890 naval jurisdic tion is considered as belonging to the
military establishment but is largdy governed by the penal code
of admiralty of 1888 there are no separate admiralty courts
in spain for civil cases he ordinary tribtinals having jurisdiction
the ancient spanish codes treated the sub ject of criminal
law quite completely for merly the laws were unusually harsh
but during the 19th century in keeping with the spirit
of the times many reforms were introduced some as early
as 1812 the present code authorized by the act of
june 1870 made only a few ma terial changes from
the code of 1848 modifi cations of the present code
were made in 1876 1904 and 1908 an amendment of
this code was extended lo cuba and porlo rico in
1879 and to the philippines in 1886 the spanish criminal
law classifies offense according to their nature into felonies crimes
and misde american punishments are classified as ajsict ive correctional
light and accessory the first class commences with death and
includes nu merous forms of imprisonment down to dis guallji
cat ions the secqnd class includes im prisonment and arrest
public censure and suspension from the privilege of holding cer
tain offices or pursuing certain callings the lighter forms of
punishment include arrest and private censure in any of these
three classes offenders may also be fined or put under
recog nizance the accessory punishments include payment of costs civil
interdiction and degra dation until modern times the system of
criminal procedure under the codes was the secret and written
procedure the hampered de fense and torture this system was
reformed by the code or act of 1882 which substituted
the accusatory system this code to date has had few
amendments it was extended after amendment to the philippines cuba
and porto rico where it became effective in 1889 among
the most important changes in procedure in spain in recent
years was the reestablishment of the jury in criminal trials
in cases of felo nies and some misdemeanors 1888 but
it has not been extended to cuba porto rico or
the philippines nor is it employed in many of the
mexican states or in the remaining spanish countries every trial
involving the ous oflfenses is commenced by a which resembles
the secret investi gation of a grand juiy after which
the accused is kept in sortary confinement while an ex
parte investigation is made by a judge of the first
instance and the slates attorney fiscal pro ceedings based on
the constitutional provision prohibiting the detention of accused persons except
for just cause somewhat resemble habeas corpiu proceedings of the
united states and great britain the judiciary act comprising 932
articles supplemented by special statutes makes pro vision for the
various courts there are three grades of civil courts courts
of the first in stance courts of appeal and the
supreme court which sits at madrid jury trial is not
em ployed in civil cases spanish law differs radically from
that of great britain and the united states in having
no judicial legislation socalled judgemade law the dcasions of none
of its courts hav ing binding power as precedents the
official legislation of modem spain com menced it may be
said with the convening of the cortes in 1810 and
two years later the first constitution was promulgated previous legis
lation consisted of edicts of the kings with codes of
law authorized by royal decree the supreme court was authorized
by the constitu tion of 1812 but it was not
finally organized until 1834 an important reform in the crim
inal law was made by the act of 1908 relating
to conditional sentence by which under certain circumstances sentences may
be suspended capital punishment still exists although many efforts have
been made to abolish it another feature of modern legislation
provides in case of wrongful convictions under certain cir cumstances
that the judges are held civilly liable in late years
spain has enacted many laws providing for social and economic
reform among them may be mentioned a workmens compensation act

for the sake of convenience the history of spanish hterature
as written in the motherland tna be retarded as constituting
four chconological div age which runs through the 16th and
17th centuries the period of the 18th century and the
more recent period which reaches from the beginning of the
19th century to the present old spanish period heroic tradition
in forms the most noble compos itk a that the
middle ages have bequeathed to spain the poema del cid
or cantar de mio cid this seems to have taken
form by the middle of the 12th century or not
long after that dale and as is unfortunately the case
with still other notable works of the old spanish period
it is preserved to us in but a single manuscript
which is in a badly garbled condition belonrang to the
14th century and being therefore about a century and a
half later than the original composition this manuscript must not
be deemed a faithful transcript of the poets labors in
all probability it reflects tixany of the linguistic and other
features of the scribes own time as it stands the
document has some 3700 odd lines these are usually bound
together into stanzas or laisses to use a term employed
to designate a similar ar rangement in old frendi epic
poetry of irregular lengthj with vocalic rhyme or as sonance
as the binding principle in the manu script the lines
vary greatly as to the number of syllables that they
contain some lines are very long others are very short
as a result there are scholars who consider the poem
as having been ametrical in the inception it is possible
however to argue that the original document was perfectly metrical
and to say that its present metrical irregularity is due
to imperfect redaction and to scribal bungling on the basis
of tacts derived from internal criti cism and in consonance
with a feeling that the true old spanish heroic measure
was the same that is still seen in the romances
or ballads the oldest of which are heroic in nature
it is not unwarrantable to declare that the author of
the ltpoema del cidgt used long verses of 14 to
16 syllables each and that the individual verses broke regularly
into halfhnes with a verse stress on the seventh syllable
in each half line mingling fact and fiction the poema
is a fine epic dealing with the career of a
great casiilian hero who lived in the llih century rodrigo
or ruy diaz de bivar who received the title cid
lord from the moors we see him passing into exile
at the behest of his monarch alphonso vi of castile
and ieon engaging in battle with both moor and christian
and assuming control of va lencia after he has taken
it from the moor the element of fiction seems to
be the prevail ing one in another document the cronica
rimada del cidgt apparently oi the 14th cen tury this
termerf also the rodngo is deemed by some a chronicle
in verse while others do not hesitate to call it
an epic or at least an aggregation of epic ballads
its nar rative relates especially to the early ufe of
the hero its form exhibits a disturbance of verse conditions
no less serious than in the case of the poema
del gd a still older hero the valorous castilian coimt
fcrnampn gonzalez of the 10th centurv is celebrated in a
school epic back of which there was probably a more
popular composition of the i3th century it is in monorhymed
quatrains of alexandrines a form of verse which now gained
favor for narrative purposes and maintained itself in vofue for
some time and it is not preserved in its entirety
such are the documents regularly dted as examples of old
spanish epic composition no others appear to have survived but
old spanish heroic traditkin was certainly more ex tensive and
treated of still other warriors and their deeds whether this
was done in poems of some length or only in
brief epieolyric com positions or ballads is a matter under
discus sion but at all events we know that during
the middle ages the juglares or minstrels of spain entertained
both nobles and commoners with their versified accounts of the
exploits of various heroes besides those already men tioned these
versified accounts have passed from view but the substance of
them with occasional retention of verses of die originals are
found in prosiiied form in the cronica general which was
begun at the incentive of king alpbonsus x of castile
in the 13th century so that this great chronicle is
aptly styled a treasure house of old spanish heroic tradition
on the basis then of material preserved in the cr6nica
general we may assume that older spain possessed heroic song
about the seven infantes de lara about an asturian hero
one bernardo del carpio about certain descendants of count fenian
gonzalez about roderick the goth whose criminal love is said
lo have have been a youthful exile in saracen spain
it may be stated here that from the isth century
on all the heroic figures eniunerated play a part in
the rich balladry of spain that is actually preserved the
eldest known drama in spanish prob ably came into existence
at about the same time as the poema del cid
it is a brief mystery play in rather elaborate verse
form on the visit of the magi to bethlehem and
it seems to derive from a latin original written in
france but from the 12th century down to the middle
of the 15tb no other spanish play has survived there
is however unmis takable evidence that pieces both religious and
profane in nature were performed during the interval the first
spanish poet known to us by name gonzalo de bereeo
made his appearance in the first half of the 13th
century bereeo showed his genuine religious devotion by composing in
unpretentious verse quatrains of monorhymed alexandrines called cauderna via lengthy
lives d 6 google spanish utbrattlrb of saints saint dominick
of silos saint milianas etc charmtne miracles of the virein
milagros de nueslra seiiora and kindred works tfaere is some
reason to ascribe to him a voluminous account in cuaderna
via of che deeds of alexander the great ijbro de
alexandre which is otherwise anonymous anonymous as yet is a
poem libro de apotonio on the adventurous career of apoiionius
of tyre verse documents of less importance and also of
the 13th century in clude a narrative dealing with the
legend of the good thief but improperly called in the
manuscripts the book of the three kings of the east
a life of saint mary of egypt vida de santa
maria egipciaqua a debate between body and sou and a
debate between water and wine with which is combined the
oldest love song in the language an adher ence lo
gallic sources and models is certain for some if not
all of these documents it was chiefly through the efforts
of alphon sus x reigned 12s284 that spanish pnose composition
received its first development this learned sovereign made his court
a centre for scientific and literary activity and with the
co operation of the scholars whom be gathered about him
he produced important astronomical lal and historical compilations it is
a note worthy fact that the king himself gave particu
lar attention to the style of the documents thus compiled
chief amon them are the astro nomical tables known since
as the alphonsine tables a comprehensive legal digest accom panied
by a philosophical and interpretative commentary the famous siele partidas
and the cronica general or cronica de espafia cited above
eollowing the fashion of the day he wrote his lyric
verse in the language of galicia a form of portuguese
after the close of the reign of alphonsus and before
the end of the century appeared the gran conquisea de
ultramar which derives in part from william of tyres latin
history of godfrey of bouillons crusade and in part from
french and pnoveniai material of a romantic and novel esque
nature very soon original prose fiction in spanish became an
actuality with the work entitled the caballero citar and in
the first half of the 14th century the short story
was consciously and carefully elaborated in the framework of tales
due to a prince of the royal blood juan manuel
12821348 a nephew of alphonsus x inspired bv the labors
of his uncle whom he admired greatly the warrior and
statesman juan manuel found time not only for the composition
of the 50 tales in his conde lucanor but also
for that of much didactic material j not the least
interesting among prose writings of the 13th and 14th cen
turies are certain spanish versions of senten tious material taken
from arabic from them seems to date the later widespread
use of the proverb by the spaniard the first genuine
poet the verse hitherto produced is not of a transcendent
quality comes to view in the person of the wayward
cleric juan ruiz arcnpriest of hita in the first half
of the i4th century even in the prison to which
he was properly condemned ior his misdeeds he continued to
write lyrics of a spontaneous ana self revelatory sort he
collected them into what he termed capriciously his book of
good love libro de btten amor while he narrates some
of his own scabrous love affairs he also displays his
knowl edge of o vidian material and some acquaintance with
french works and he imitates a form of the popular
lyric in his mountaingirl songs the leading work in verse
in the latter half of the 14th century is the
rimado de palado of pedro ldpez de ayala a versatile
man who became grand chancellor of castile he served under
four kings and reveals his knowledge of affairs in his
prose chronicle of their reigns a work which is one
of hnks in the series of chronicles stretching from cr6nica
general of alphonsus x down to the appearance of fully
elaborated historical works in the a of the renaissance the
rimado de palacio is largely satirical in its constitution inveighing
against the vices and defects in all forms of society
of his t during the which nearly c 15th century
the court was thronged with versi fiers whose methods were
principally an imita tion of those lof the provenial troubadours
these had been welcome visitors in spain for a couple
of centuries before and their themes had been acceptable to
high society especially their theorizing on love but the reechoes
of their speculation that we find in the ditdes of
the spanish poetasters of the 15th century are in the
main stale and unprofitable as may be seen in a
survey of the examples contained in the collection cancionem de
baena made by the court physician and versifier juan baena
in aragon the provencalizitig methods also had vogue and they
passed over to italy with the establishment of an aragonese
court at naples some of the spanish compositions written in
italy are assembled in the socalled jandoneno de stijliiga at
the castilian court an alle gorizing tendency harking back above
all to dante and boccaccio was very marked and the
first notes of the coming renaissance were struck when versions
were made of some of the works of classic latiti
enrique de villena an eastern spaniard related to the royal
bouses of both aragon and castile was in no few
respects an early spanish humanist the castilian ifiigo l6pez de
mendoza marqujs de san li liana was one of the
more truly inspired writers of the time he shows some
appredation of the popular poetry of his own land along
with an impress of italian influences and he used the
allegorical forms with somewhat more felicity than most of his
contemporaries the most elaborate employment of allegorical ma chinery was
made by juan de mena court his toriographer of juan
ii as may be percdved in his poem 0 laberinto
which also evi dences uie spaniards interest in the humanistic
movement now spreading out from italy while with austerity the
inevitableness of death is preached in the stanzas o the
castilian dance of death danza de la muertegt a different
view of the perishability of all things mortal is taken
by the true poet jorge man rique 144078 in his
sweet and mournful coplas in which he dedares that this
mortal existence is but the threshold leading to the real
life beyond the grave gentle resignation is his keynote from
the pen of g6mez man rique the uncle of jorge

by femsn perei de guzman whose character portraits in his
generaciones y semblanzas merit a place of distinction the spanish
bal lad is one of the most prized manifestallans olthe
national literary spirit naturally the earliest of those preserved in
print could not precede the settingup of the press which
appears to have occurred about 1474 only very few have
been handed down from antiquity in manuscript form and none
of these can antedate the 15lh century the oldest extant
amon the more than 2000 ballads are heroic in subject
acclaiming the national heroes whom we have seen figuring in
the old spanish epics and in accounts embalmed in the
crinica general according to an ingenious theory advocated by some
leading spanish scholars the most ancient among the ballads were
simply portions of still older epics about the heroes the
parts of these latter that he people demanded most insistently
from the popular entertainers the juglares who chanted and recited
them and the later ballads were modeled on these brief
extracts it has not been demonstrated however thai ballads that
is brief epicolyric narratives did not exist even as early
as the very time of the heroic personages whom those
known to us com memorate such mav have been the
fact and they may nave been kept alive by oral
tradition until finally the first broadsheets were turned off from
the press in the 15th century at all events the
spanish ballad lives on with un diminished vitality from the
16th century trained writers have imitated their form and wherever
people of the spanish stock are found today new ballads
are being produced by them certainly one of the most
important works issued from the press before the end ai
the 15lh century was the first discoverable edi tion of
the famous chivalric romance amadis de gaula the parent of
a numerous progeny of amadises palmerines and other stories of
derringdo that were to keep on appearing down to the
beginning of the 17th century when the don quijole was
to give them their quietus in some form or other
the amadis de gaula was already in circulation back in
the 14th century for there are refer ences to it
in other works of that period another noted novel one
actuated by a spirit which we now call naturalistic was
printed at least as early as the opening of the
16th cen tury this was the celestina or tragicome dia
de calisto y metibea which is strictly speakine an example
of prose fiction in golden age under charles v spain
attained to the proportions of a world empire and a
glorious development in literature as welt as the other arts
attended her great growth in political importance during the preceding
rdgn of ferdinand and isabella there were already clear signs
of the inauguration of that period of uteraiy splendor which
the spaniards term their siglo de oro for a large
n the humanistic culture of italy had been trans mitted
to the iberian peninsula in the time of the catholic
sovereipms in poetry a direct influence of italian literature manifested
itself ere the 16th century had proceeded far in its
course for through the efforts particularly of juan boscan d
1542 and garcilaso de la vega 150i36 the various forms
utilized by the italians were imparted into spanish and the
old prosody was enriched by the addition of the 1
1 syllabled line the octave the sonnet the ode etc
the labors of these two poets in spain paralleled in
permanent effect those of the pliade in france and of
wyat and surrey in england other writers such as diego
hurtado de mcndoza acuiia and cetina helped to acclimate the
new forms and pre vailed over more conservative spirits like
castiuejo who resisted the innovations the flourish of the drama
was perhaps the most distinctive feature of the century and
a half or more during which the golden age of
spanish letters was m full vigor the patriarch oi the
spanish theatre was juan del encina who had already begun
to write before the end of the 15th century and
who like numerous spanish authors after him spent some time
in italy service in the spanish campaigns took these men
to the land of the renaissance where they imbibed the
spirit prevailink there a nomadic soul torres tfaharro published at
the aragonese court of naples in 1517 a col lection
of plays in which prominence is given already to the
punctilio pundanor a motive which was to be stressed to
an extraordinary degree in the further development of the spanish
drama lope de rueda d c 1565 imitated italian dramatists
very directly in his longer pieces but attained his real
success in the composition of brief ctarac interludes pasot that
brought upon the scene popular characters taken from the life
of the time rueda was an actor and stagemanager as
well as a writer since his time the vogue of
the short oneact play of humorous and occasionally farcical tendencies
has never died out in spain it is the ginero
chico of today with the pieces of juan de la
cueva d c 1609 the historical drama was intioduced and
to a cer tain degree he anticipated also the comedia
de capa y espada which lope de vega was to
cultivate with wonderful skill cervantes 1547 1616 essayed with no
meed of success the role of the playwright although two
of his longer plays the numancia and the trato de
argel are not negligible but beyond all odds the dominating
personality among all spanish dramatists of the first half of
the golden age was lope de vepa 15621635 who inheriting
technical details of dramatic composition from his immediate predecessors applied
them with the unerring skill of a dramatic genius after
lope and until the end of the golden age he
preeminent playwright was calder6n 160081 lope tried his hand at
practically every possible form of the drama and reached the
height of bis fame with his elaboration of the comedy
of character and manners comedia de capa y espada his
fertility was prodigious as he seems to have written no
fewer than 1500 pieces calderon was not so markedly successful
with the piay o google spanish literature 3 he slill
pleases posterity with the lyricism that pervades his pieces he
is celebrated mosl of 1 for his perfecting of the
allegorical and religious drama dealing especially with the virtues of
the eucharist auto iocramcntat lope it should not be forgotten
exercised his talents in many directions and left untried hardly
any of the genres he will always be classed among
the best of spanish lyric poets other dramatists of the
sigla de oro of pro nounced merit were gabriel tblex
pseudonvm tirso de molina 15m648 guiuen de castro i5i63n ruiz
de alarcon d 1639 rojas zorriua d 16601 and moreto
161869 the dramas of the golden age are regularly in
verse in prose the most distinguished achievements took form in
the novel and the short story and a consideration of
these at once suggests the name f cervantes 15471616 his
don quijote first part 1605 second part 1615 the most
noted work of spanish belles lettres and the greatest novel
in the history of the worlds literature was begun as
a satire upon the methods of the novel of chivalry
but remains important as one of the most eminent expositions
of the neverceasing strugrle be tween reahstic and idealistic impulses
in human nature his exemplary tales novelas ejemplares set up
a model for the shorter torm of prose fiction before
the middle of the 6ih centui there had been primed
the lazarillo de tormes the earliest of the picaroon stories
or novels of roguery which if not the work of
hurtado de mendoza must remain anonymous later novels of the
type recounting the wanderings and exploits of a roguish hero
are the guzman de alfarache of malo alemin d 1609
the picara jus tina 1605 of obeda the ltbusc6n of
the publicist and satirist quevedo and the marcos de obreg6ngt
of vicente espinel 1618 after cervantes the short story was
cultivated with some understanding by salas barbadilto castillo solfirzano and
maria de zayas the pastoral romance was attempted by many
writers even cervantes and lope de vega being of he
number but the highest measure of suc cess in the
enre was achieved by jorge de montemayor m his diana
e isss and by gil polo in his sequel thereto
a solitary but not infelicitous example of the historical novel
in the age is the guerras civiies de granada of
perez de hita true history writing takes the place of
the earlier chronicles at this time above all in the
historia de espana written originally in latin of the jesuit
mariana d 1623 in the accounts of affairs in eastern
spain by zurita and in the records of happen ings
in the new world by antonio de solis i 1688
and many others history was in tentionally mingled with fiction
by antonio de guevara d 1545 in his marco aurelio
and his dada de los ccsares and to him is
due also the epistolas familiares a work which in translation
eventually reached england and is said to have helped to
promote an over refined style of composition there at least
a mention should be made of the prose labors of

of decay set in rapidly in the field of letters
it became wellnigh absolute in the early years of the
18lh century the writers were still many but their aesthetic
sense and that of their readers were of a deplorably
low order the advent of the bourbons with phillip v
who came to the throne in 1700 led to a
large in flux of frenchmen to the court and a
con siderable frenchifying of fashions from france there came also
the neo classic methods of her writers which the critic
ignacio de luzin 170254 recommended to his spanish fellrowcountrymen as
providing a panacea for the hterary ills of spain in
his poitica 1737 luzampn paid particular attention to the reform
of the spanish theatre which had fallen into a chaotic
condition and he urged the adoption by spanish playwrights of
the three unities and the other leading principles of neo
classic restraint which had been in force in france since
the l7th century the ideas of luzan met with acceptance
there was some translation of french dramatic pieces and some
spaniards of talent wrote original plays cast in the french
classic mold among these were n f de moratin moralin
the elder 173780 the statesman jovellanos d 1811 and moratin
the son leandro fernandez de moratin 17601828 the greatest of
the trio was the last named who acquired favor with
the many by means of his pieces reflecting his veneration
for the french dramatist motiere and especially by his two
prose plays el cafe and el si de las nifias

lemres per sanes and derived inspiration for his noches lugubres

among the historians scholars and critics of the period the
more recent period only to a slight degree did the
rationalistic spirit of the french 18m century show itself in
the workings of the minds of the french writers who
have been mentioned thus far as subordinating themselves to the
precepts of neo classicism but in the leading author of
the openine of the 19th cen tury rationalism dominates along
with fiery lib eralism he is quintana 177218s7 his en

which he a patriotic spaniard assailed the napoleonic invaders of
his land during the war of independence with him was

elegies of highly plastic form though they fought the french
classicism these methods still found ceptance with the young men
who constituted the coterie of writers known as the school

spanish literary tradition the romantic movement which had swept europe
outside reached spain somewhat be lated in the fourth decade
of the century liberal writers who had fled the land

death in 1833 and helped efficaciously in spreading the evangel
of romanticism which bad come to them in england and
france as snderstood by them romanticism was the very antithesis
of classicism in that it threw oft all restraint and
believed in giving unchecked ex pression to the feelings of
the inner man and moreover it sought inspiration in the
christian middle ages and not in pagan classic antiquity so
favored by the classicists martinei de la rosa lt 17871862
who is in many respects still a votary of classicism
manifested clear tend encies toward romanticism in his play la
conjuracidn de venecia 1834 a decided victory for the new
doctrines was won in 1835 by the performance at madrid
of the play don alvaro by the duque de rivas

who lived at this time developed their activities in rome
instead of their native country we might even speak of
a distinct spanish school as it is the composers in
question formed an integral part of what is known as
the roman school of church music culminating in the renowned
palestrina the most imporunt masters of spanish origin connected with
this school were morales and vilioria both living in the
i6ih century the former a writer of great serious ness
and elevation of style was a predecessor of palestrina in
the papal chapel and probably exercised considerable influence on his
music development the latter was one of the most prominent
successors of the great roman com poser indeed the names

and is likewise characteristic especially in its rhythm indeed the

supposed to have got its name signifying scattered it con

the district in which sparta was situated was the southeastern
division of the pelopon nesus bounded on the west by
messenia from which it was separated by the chain of
tayge tns on the north by arcadia and arciis aad
on the east and south by the sea the principal
towns in laconia besides sparta were amyclx and pharis both
situated like sparta on the west bank of the eurotas
a little lower down the spartans were the descendants of
the dorians who invaded the peloponnesus about 80 years after
the siege of troy and from an earl period they
conformed to a set of rigor ous institutions aimed at
making them a purely warlike nation these institutions they them
selves ascribed to lycurgus who if he was really a
historical character must have lived not later than the 9th
century it is probable that shortly after their settlement in
the peloponnesus the spartans extended their sway over all the
territory of laconia the inhabit ants of which they reduced
parity to the con dition of helots and partly to
that of period the former were completely enslaved bound to
the land which thev had to tilt for thdr masters
and required to serve the state in war the latter
were free possessing land of their own and carrying on
trade and practising the arts both of which pursuits were
forbidden to spartans the next great wars of sparta are
usually rerded as the direct consequence of their new institutions
tho were waged with the messenians in the 8th anjl
7 th cen turies bc and resulted in 668 bc
in the com plete subjugation of the bfessenians who were
either compelled to leave their country or were reduced to
the condition of helots wars were also carried on against
their northern neibors the arcadians and the argives against both
of whom they were successful and before the close of
the 6th century bc they not only stood at the
head of the states of the peloponnesus but were even
recognized as the leading people in all greece early in
the fol lowing century bqn the persian wars in which
sparta played a conspicuous part but the details down to
the conclusion of the pelopon nesian war in 404 bc
belong to the common history of greece to which the
reader is re ferred the events of the wars with
persia led to sparta being supplanted by athens as the
leading state in greece hence arose a jealousy between the
two cities which ultimately brought on a war in which
the onehalf of greece was divided against the other and
this war the peloponnesian ended in the ascend ency of
sparta and the entire huniiliation of her rival the rivalry
of the spartan general lysander and the king pausanias soon
after produced a revolution which delivered the athenians from the
spartan yoke 403 a little later the spartans became involved
in a war with persia by joining cyrus the younger
in his rebellion against his brother artaxerxes mnemon 401 the
war was continued even after the failure of the enterprise
of cyrus and the persian throne was shaken by the
victories of agesilaus but athens thebes corinth and some of
the peloponnesian slates took this op portunity to declare war
against the lacede monians the latter defeated the thebans at
coronea 394 but on the other hand the athenian commander
conon gained a victory over the spartan fleet at cnidus
this war known as the bceotian or corinthian war lasted
eight years and increased the reputation and power of athens
to break the alliance of athens with persia sparta in
387 bc con cluded with the latter power the peace
known by the name of antalcidas and the designs of
sparta became apparent when she occupied without provocation the city
of thebes and introduced an aristocratical constitution there felopidas delivered
thebes and the celebrated theban war 378363 followed in which
sparta was much enfeebled during the fol lowing century sparta
steadily declined al though one or two isolated attempts were
made to restore its former greatness the prindpal of these
was made by geomenes 236222 but his endeavors failed because
there were then scarcely 700 of spartan descent and the
majorihr of these were in a slate of beggary with
the rest of greece sparta later passed under the dominion

spartacans or spartacides is the name acquired soon after the
going into esect of the armistice accorded genninv in 1918
by the special followers of karl pendents notably during the
several risings of the latter against the moderate or majority
socialists under the leadership of ebert and scheidemann who had
formed a composite government from which the spartacans had withdrawn
as not realizing their pohticai and economic ideals there were
several of these organized or centralized risings the more con
siderable occurring in january 1919 when in berlin alone the
deaths in the fighting on both sides were computed at
sundry thousands and quite a number of local and insufficiently
or ganized ones in various parts of germany such as

places the communistic uprising in munich on the other hand
which occurrra during march and april 1919 does not properly
figure under the head of sparlacan undertakings the name of
sparlacan originated from the pen name of karl uebknecht spartacus
which he had adopted while being held prisoner by the
former german imperial government during the last two years of
the great war 191618 for his clandestine articles appearing in
the press of the left wing of the sodafist party
notably die freiheit the genesis of the spartacans however ought
to be traced to the very begin nings of the
great war to august 1914 when the extreme wing of
the great socialist party in germany first owed signs of
a desire to secede from the parly as a whole
as beinpr unalterably opposm to the whole war which they
deemed as being engineered by capitalis tic and militaristic influences
and therefore to be condemned in tola this desire not
long after they carried out openly constituting them selves as
a new party in the reichstag in oppo sition to
all others and refusiiik throughout the remainder of the war
to vote tor supplies and funds to sustsdn it when
the split took place out of a total of 108
party members in the reichstag 19 subsequently increased to 23
left che socialist party and called itself the independent after
the rather tame revolution that ousted the kaiser in the
beginning of no vember 1918 and led to the overturn
of the whole imperial regime and the armistice itself this
independent or as later denominated spartacan party veered further to
radical tenets becoming in fact communisiil even occasionally anarchistic in
its aims and prac tices and not only leaning to

the advantage of the conical form is satis factorily explained
on the assumption that waves of sound are reflected in

incidence and the angle of reflection being the same for
on this assumption it is evident that waves of sound
proceeding from the narrow to the wide end of a
truncated cone from the walls of which they are reflected
according to the law referred to will gradually make smaller
angles with the axis of the cone or in other
words the direc tion of the sound will gradually become
more nearly parallel to that axis a cylindrical tube of
uniform diameter has not the same effect and accordingly is
of no use in determining the direction of sound after
it leaves the tube although as is seen in the

resump tion of specie payments after the dose of the

very clear as in the case of uie four kinds
of crow above mentioned it requires a period of criticism
before a satisfactory com promise between the lumpers and the

this is simply that in many cases one species is
linked to another by intermediate varieties and it may be

ity of a body is the ratio of the mass
of that body to the mass of an equal volume
of some standard substance which is arbitrarily selected for purposes
of reference in the cases of soliik and liquids it
is cusiomaiy to select water as the standard substance and
water is always understood in connection with solids and uquids
unless the contrary is explicitly stated gases are also sometimes
referred to water but it is much commoner to compare
the density of a gas with that of air or
hydro gen the specific gravity of a solid which is
not affected by contact with water may be de termined
by weighing the sohd twice once while it is surroundea
with air and once while it is submerged in water
the difierence be tween the two weights so obtained gives
the weight of a mass of water whose volume is
equal to that of the solid and hence in order
to determine the specific gravity of the sohd it is
onlv necessary to divide uie weight as ob served in
air by the loss of weight when it is submerged
in water if the solid is soluble in water or
if it is afiected by water in any other manner
its specific gravity must be determined by some indirect method
many such methods are known for example we may replace
the water by some other liquid such as benzene in
which the solid is not soluble and then per form
the experiment precisely as described above the result so obtained
is the specific gravity of the substance with reference to
the benzene or whatever liquid is employed in its place
and in order to express the specific gravity of the
body with reference to water we have merely to multiply
its specific gravity with respect to benzene by the specific
gravity of the benzene as compared with water the specific
gravity of a liquid may be de termined very accurately
by means of the specific gravity bottle this is a
bottle made of thin glass so as to be light
and provided with a groundglass stopper the weight of the
bottle is determined 1 when it is empty 2 when
it is filled with water and 3 when it is
filled with the liquid whose specific gravity is desired from
these data we can easily aetermine the weight of the
water in the bottle and also that of the second
liquid and upon dividing the latter by the former we
obtain the specific gravity sought the specific gravity of a
liquid may be obtained more ex peditiously though less accurately
by means of the simple instrument known as the hydrom
eter this consists essentially of a glass bulb usually cylindrical
in shape provided at its upper end with a graduated
stem and weighted at its lower end with shot or
mer cury so that it wilt float in an upright
position when placed in a liquid sufficiently dense to permit
it to float at all it is evident that such
an instrument will be buoyed up more by a dense
liquid than by a lighter one and when the stem
at its upper end has once been graduated correctly we
have only to place die hydnnneter dgt google sfbopic oka
vity in ihe liquid whose specific gravity is desired and
observe he depth to which it sinks as read from
the graduatecl stem in fahrenheits form of the instrumenl there
is only one graduation mark on the stem but a
small pan is pro vided at the top of the
hydrometer and the observation consists in determining what weights must
be placed upon this pan in order to cause the
instrument to sink to the standard level indicated by the
mark on the stem hy drometers are often graduated for
special pur poses so that instead of indicating the specific
gravity of the litjuid in which they are placed their
readings give at once the percentage of alcohol or of
some other substance that is present such instruments are called
alcohol ometers sahnomeiers lactometers etc accord ing to the special
kind of liquid eor whose investigation ihey are graduated as
the density of water varies with the temperature it is
necessary if we are to have a standard of density
that is definite and accu rate enough for scientific purposes
to specify the temperature of the water with whidi the
comparison is made in england the standard temperature of the
water was formerly taken at 62 f but it is
now the almost universal practice to make the comparison with
water at its temperature of maximum density or at about
39 f in the vicinity of this tempera ture the
density of water varies very slowly with the temperature and
hence in comparing the density of a substance with that
of water at or near 39 f it is not
essential to observe the temperature of the water with any
high degree of precision it was indeed this con venient
and practical fact which led to the adoption of 39

the foregoing values however are sufliciently accu rate for general
purposes and more precise information is given in this encyclopedia
in many cases in the articles upon the several substances
named the term specific gravity is not now used as
commonly as it formerly was the density of the substance
being spoken of instead it being understood in such cases
that it is the daisity of the substance relatively to
water that is meant and not its absolute density as
expressed in units of mass per unit of volume in
the system of units employed in the united states and
in england ttus double use of the word density may
sometimes lead to confusion the metric system is now however
very laiely used in scientific work and here the confusion
cannot well occur for in the metric system the unit
of mass the gramme is the mass of a cubic
centimeter of water at its temperature of maximum density and
hence in this system the absolute density of a substance
and its density relatively to water are one and the
in the case of gases the expression specific pravity is
now almost never used density hav ing practically displaced it
the accurate de termmation of the density of a gas
is very difficult and calls for great experimental skill and
the finest of apparatus in the irsual method of performing
such a determination a pair of glass globes as nearly
identical as possible are suspended from the respective arms of
a delicate balance and weights are added at one end
or the other until perfect equilibrium is attained one of
die globes is then thoroughly exhausted by means of an
airpump while the other is filled with the gas under
examination the equilibrium of the balance will be destroyed by
this process and if we restore it by adding weights
to the arm carryinjr the exhausted sphere we shall thereby
ascertain the weight of the gas in the other sphere
by repeating the experiment with gases of different hinds the
weights of equal volimies of these different gases will be
ascer tained and if the various weights so obtained are
all divided by the weight as obtained for hydrogen for
example the quotients will be the densities of the vanous
gases with respect to hydrogen the relative densities of some
of the more familiar gases are given in the follow

case is one atmosphere and the tem perature 32 f
the relative densities of the gases here given do not
change much for con siderable variations of temperature and pres

hence in the iiuerest of accuracy it is desirable to
state as follows the precise conditions under which the table

follows the specific heal of a body is the ratio
of ihe quantity of heat required to raise the temiperature
of that body one de gree to ihe quantity required
to raise the tem perature of an equal weighl of
water one de gree for most engineering purposes and for
rough calculations of all kinds this definition is sufficiently accurate
it assumes however that the quantity of heat reltiuired to
raise the tem perature of one pound of water by
ore degree is the same in all parts of the
thermometric scale and while this is approximately true it cannot
be admitted when we have to deal with heatmeasurements of
a high order of precision we must then define the
spectac heat of a body as the number of units
of heat that must be added to a unit mass
of the body in order to raise the temperature of
the body by one de gree a unit of heat
being simultaneously de fined as the quantity of heat that
is required in order to raise the temperature of a
unit mass of water by one degree at some particular
part of the thermometric scaie various sueslious have been made
as to the particular temperature that the water should havct
in the definition of the unit of heat and different
experimenters have used different units to the great confusion of
the subject of heatmeasuremem in general there is now a
marked tendency toward the general adoption of a temperature of
about 15 c 59 f so that a unit of
heat would be defined in the metric system as the
quan tity of heat thai is required to raise the
tem perature of one gram of water from 145 c
lo 155 c and in the familiar english and american
system the unit would be similarly defined as the quantity
of beat required to raise the temperature of a pound
of water from 585 f to 595 f adopting this
definition of the unit of heat we may speak of
the specific heat of water itself the specific heat of
that fluid at c being the quantity of heat required
to raise the temperature of a certain mass of water
by one degree at j c divided by ihe quantity
of heat required to raise the temperature of an equal
mass of it by one degree at the temper ature

the highest importance to the physicist to know precisely how
the specific heat of water as thus desned varies with

among themselves the gen eral acceptance of regnaults work on
the spe cific beat of water has vitiated many otherwise
important researches on the subject of heat but we are
now in possession of data that appear to be very
much superior and the confusion that has prevailed in the

the corrections which must be made in order to take
the actual variation into account are tedious and their accurate

which the reader cannot be assumed to possess the specific

mined by heating tlie body to a known temper ature
and then immersing it cuicldy in a deii nite mass
of water whose initial temperature is also known if we
denote the mass oc the water by iv and that
of the body under investigation by m and if t
is the initial temperature of the water and tt that
of the body and if 5 is the specific heat
of the body and t is the hnal tem perature
that the body and the water have in common we
may calculate the specific heat s as follows the temperature
of the water has been raised from ti to t
and the mass of the water is w pounds or
grams as the case may be then it follows that
the number of units of heat that have been absorbed
by the water is wt ti similarly the body has
cooled from t 10 t and its mass is m
hence if the body had a specific heat precisely equal
to that of water we should know that it had
given up iiti 7 units of heat its actual specific
heat however is 5 and hence it follows by the
definition of specific heat that the actual quan tity of
heat ven out by the body is sm ttt units
as we shall suppose thai the radiation and conduction of
heat between the apparatus and outside objects is negligible it
follows that the quantity of heat given out by the
body is equal to the quantity absorbed by the water
that is we must have tne equation wttsmt t and
from this we easily find wtt mt t in the
actual conduct of an experiment of this kind there arc
many difficulties to overcome and many corrections lo be estimated
and ap plied there is always more oi less communi
cation of heat between the apparatus and out side objects
and the heal that is given out by the cooling
body warms not only the water but also the containmg
vessel the thermometers and the stirring apparatus in determining ihe
specific heat of a body advantage is often taken of
the known fact that the quantity of heat required to
melt one pound of ice at 32 f is approximately
the same as the quantity of heal required to raise
the tempera ture of one pound of water by 140
f in the application of this fad to the determination
of specific heats the body under investigalion is surrounded by
ice and the number of units of heat thai are
fnven off is determined by observ ing the quantity of
ice that is melted and multiplying that quantity as expresicd
in pounds by 140 bunsen devised a very delicate apparatus
for the execution of this sori of measurement in his
instrument the body to be studied is placed in a
cupshaped depression in a glass vessel thai is filled with
ice and water and which is entirely sealed save for
a grad uated capillary tube one end of which enlers
the mixture of ice and water while the other end
projects into the air the quantitv of ice that is
melted by the heat given off from ihe ldy is
not directly observed but is inferred from the change in
volume of the iceandwater mixture as indicated by the motion
of an index drop of mercury in the caoillary lube
it beine known that ice upon melting contracts by about
one twelflh of its own volume the specific heat of
a gas is defined in pre cisely the same way
as the spedlif heat of any other body but in
the case of gases it is neces sary to specify
the way in whidi the change of temperature of the
gas takes place thus we may heat a gas while
we maintain its pressure constant permitting the volume to increase
as much as it will or we may heat it
while its volume is kept constant the pressure mean while
increasing the specific heats obtained under these two different conditions
are quite different in numerical value and they are dis
tinguished respectively as the speciiic heat at constant pressure and
the specific heal at con stant volume the specific heat
of a gas at constant pressure may be determined with
considerable accuracy by causing a stream of the gas to
flow through a calorimeter so that it ex periences a
definite fall in temperature in its transit the quantity of
heat given up by the gas can be made to
be very considerable and hence easily measurable by continuing the
how for a sufficient time and to determine the spe
cific heat at constant pressure we then have merely to
divide the total quantity of heal given out by the
gas by the total mass of the gas that has
been passed through the calorimeter and again by the fall
in temperature that the gas has experienced the specific heat
at constant volume is more difficult to obtain and it
has usually been determined by an indirect method rather than
by direct measurement it can be determined directly however and
apparently with considerable precision by means of the joly steam
calorimeter following are the specific heats of a number of
substances though it must be remembered that many of them
are more or less uncertain not only because they vary
in the case of solids from one specimen to another
and from one temperature to another in all substances but
also because in their determination the iher mometric and calori

the tuesday 12 april 1709 deserves to be remembered as
an impoi tant date in the history of english literature
for on that day richard steele issued the first number
of the tatler this modest half sheet issued thrice a
week was in reality the begin ning of english periodical
literature defoe had founded his review two years before but
that was a little sheaf of political news and opinions
with no charm of literary quality it was the merit
of steele to perceive the oppor tunity for a new
form ot journal which should picture in entertaining fashion and
in a temper of kindly satire the manners and conduct
of contemporary society he put at the head of his
first number a couplet from juvenal wluuvbr men do or
say err think or dream out motley popct ntia for
its theme addison it seems had not been informed of
steeles project and did not recognize the hand of his
friend until the sixth number he is supposed to have
written the eighteenth paper but did not join steele as
a regular con tributor until near the close of the
year 1709 in the next two years his aid became
indispen sable as steele himself said i fared like a
distressed prince who called in a powerful neighbor to his
aid and when i had called him in 1 could
not subsist without him on 2 jan 1711 the tatler
was brought suddenly to an end but after an interval
of two months was followed by that more famous paper
the stec tator the spectator is usually spoken of as
addisons but in fact it was under the joint conduct
of addison and steele and the con tributions of the
two men were about equal in number yet it is
not without good reason that we speak of addisons spectator
addisons humor if less buoyant and convivial than steeles was
more subtle delicate and widely observant steele was the typical
man about town who threw himself heartily into the life
of the hour addison was rather as he styled himself
a spectator who sat in his armchair at buttons and
watched the varied play of hfe about him with quiet
superior satis taction mr spectator is always courteous refined ur
bane you feel in his page the charm of man

some of the critical papers especially the famous series on
miltons paradise lost have been greatly admired and frequently reprinted
but die reader of today will probably noi find them
of absorbing interest their criticism is purely formal and academic
addison is trying to prove by aristotles rules that milton
was a great poet of all such criticism it may
be said that if the reader knows his milton it
is needless if he does not it is useless the
eth ical and religious papers though perhaps less often mentioned
are some of them rather more entertaining addison was the
son of a dean and always something of a preacher

be a little prosy but it is always wholesome and

all the sermons preached in the queen anne time for
they brout relijon and morality into fashion but most of
the humor and the wisdom of the spectator trnght have
perished had it not been for the perfection of the
style in which they were conveyed steele wrote as he
talked in rapid careless fashion he would not stay for
careful elaboration or tedious cor rection addison on the contrary
was careful even finical in all matters of expression but

they were crowded into london where they were readily accessible
to the pamphleteer and journalist eighty thousand copies of defoes
true borti eng lishman were sold on the streets of
london and swifts conduct of the allies ran through four
editions in one week it was steele and addison who
first hit upon the new literary form adapted to the
wants of such a class of readers they were the
creators of english popular literature it was addison espedaliy who

newton we owe two cental dis coveries concerning the nature
of ut in 16c0 he demonstrated experimentally that white light
contains all the colors of the rainbow that the simple
prismatic colors obtained by analyz ins white light cannot be
farther separated into other colors by passing them through prisms
and that color in general is merely while light from
which has been removed some of its colored constituents besides
this newton established the fact that these luminous dis turbsnces
which he thout of as moods of easy and of
difficult transmission but which we now call litwaves are not
irregular pulses as huyxens imagined but are periodic in char
acter this inference is drawn from the phe nomenon known
as newtons rings we come next to the work of
thomas young 1773 1829 who amprst demonstrated the fact that
under proper conditions two tsfs of light that is two
trains of lightwaves may interfere in such a manner as
to produce darkness yoiuigs explanation of diffraction however proved to
be utterly inauificient and for the phenomenon of polarization he
cotild offer no explanation whatever for the reason that he
conceived lightwaves to be longitudinal and not transverse vibrations to
summarize youngs work most briefly would be to say that
he introduced into optics the principle of in terference or
of nonlnterference as sug gested by michelson since the principle
cltm sists merely in the fact that of two ligt
rays of any color travel with a speed of approx
imately 186330 miles per second while in all ordinary matter
light travels with less speed the amount of diminution becoming
greater and greater as we pass from the red to
the violet bearing in mind this conception of a train
o lightwaves we proceed toconsider the gen eral method of

by combining the principle of huygens with the principle of
interference and by introducing the idea that lihtwaves unlike soundwaves
are transverse disturbances evi dence for this view lay in
the fact that light can be polarized we may now
summarize the labors of these four men by saying that
experi ment seems to indicate that light consists in a
transverse wavemotion in a medium which per vades all known
space and which we call the ether in space devoid
of ordinary matter light we shall in the following four
si sider these four steps 2 sources of radiation in
practice the spectroscopist is limited to two artificial sources namely
flames and electric currents besides these are many natural sources
such as hght ning the aurora borealis meteors stars glow
worms etc but the nature and occurrence of these natural
phenomena are so far beyond our control that mey do
not here call for discus sion adopting the following classification
we scan indudmg the nm caddie oiyhy6tottn bnuh dncharge now
proceed to a description of some par ticular artificial sources
candle and alcohol flames these have mainly a historical interest
as being the hrst sources in which line spectra were
observed the temperature of the alcohol flame is only roughly
known but is probably not far from 1300 c substances
are easily introduced into the flame and the flame itself
is fairly colorless these two qualities combined to make it
very useful in the early history of the science bunsen
ftamethe flame which bunsen devised in 1856 has three marked
advantages as a spectroscopic source namely it is simple in
construction and operation its outer mantle is almost totally devoid
of any characteristic spectrum of its own and it possesses
a high temperature many measurements of the tem perature of
this flame have been made but there is good reason
for believing that nearly all of these are under estimates
the most re liable measurement is probably that of weg
gener at berlin who obtained 1788 c for the outer
mantle the temperature of the violet mantle is probably about
100 or 200 less while the temperature of the inner
dark cone ranges from 250 to 500 c the substance
whose spectnuu is desired may be introduced into the flame
in a great variety of ways bun sen used a
bead of the material on a platinum wire sometimes a
piece of asbestos is con venient goiiy uses tfie spray
from an atomizer eder and valenta have employed a platinum
wireganze wheel to transport the solution fromgta dish to the
flame oxyhydrogtn ftame twii flame is also nearly coiorlessj has
an exceedingly high tem d google 374 spectroscopy perature and
gives spectra appro ximaiing those obtained in the electric are
it has been used with great skill by w n
hartley electric arc this source has been in com mon
use since the tovention of ic gramine dynamo 1876 the
arc is ferally used in one of two ways either
by drilling holes in the carbon rods and filling these
holes with the tna terial whose spectrum is desired or
by making the electrodes directly and euiirely out of the
substance which is being studied this latter method is of
course practicable only in the case of materials which conduct
electricity the temperature of the carbon arc is not accu
rately known but probably lies between 3500 and 3900 c
as a spectroscopic source it is admirable in nearly every
respect except that in those regions of the spectrum which
are most easily studied carbon has a strong spectrum of
ils own which is always superposed upon that of the
substance under investigation in the ease of metals the easiest
method of avoiding this difficulty is to use a rapidly
rotating metal disc for one electrode and a metal rod
for the other the incandescent metal vapor thus ob tained
yields the purest spectra known electric spark of all sources
of radiation that which is most generally convenient and most
widely used is perhaps the electric spark obtained by use
of an ordinary induction coil spark discharges may also be
obtained from aik electrostatic machine such as the vvimshurst from
a tesla coil or even from a high voltage storage
battery in general the electric spark produces two spectra namely
the spectrum of the electrodes and the spectrum of the
air or other gas between the two electrodes but as
was discovered by plucker in 18s8 the spec trum of
the electrodes may be avoided by en closing them in
a partial vacuum under these conditions one gets only the
spectrum of the surrounding gas so that now he almost
uni versal method of studying the spectra of gases is
to seal platinum electrodes into a glass tube and then
fill ihe tube under low pressure with the gas to
he studied the converse problem of gelling the spectrum of
the electrodes without that of the surrounding gas has been
solved by dcmarcay schuster and hcmsalech who have proved that
practically all the air lines of a spectrum may be
eliminated by placing in the discharge circuit 3 proper amount
of inductance in this manner the discharge is prolonged and
is made to re semble hat of the arc the
electrodes are connected in series with an inductance i and
in parallel with a capacity dikhirge d butoy b id

i a al iltenwtjng currsni c concerning the temperature of
the spark veiy little is known it has been generally
assumed to be very much higher than that of the
electric arc but there is no direct evidence for this
view and there is much indirect evidence against it 3
separation of radiationa let us sup pose that we now
have before us one of the abovementioned sources whose spectrum
it is pic 3 prism uwd for thii figan a
tftken pubtiiled tgty mr desired to examine the next step
will be to separate the rays of various wavelengths so
thai we may examine them independently the reader may here
assume that each different substance introduced into the flame or
arc gives a different spectrum peculiar to itself for this
is the experimental basis of spectrum analysis this analysis is
usually accomplished either by passing the light through a pnsm
or by allow ing it to fall upon a diffraction
grating tke prism spectroscope if the source of light be
small and if it is necessary to make only a
hasty visual examination the most convenient plan is simply to
view the source through a prism placed immediately in front
of the eye as indicated in fig 3 this is
an especially useful method in ob serving the dieharge in
the capillary portion of a vacuum tube the chief difficulty
in the naked prism is thai the source however small
is generally still so large that the successive colored images
formed by the prism will over lap each other leaving
the separation incom plete to avoid this diificulty a small
tele scope called a collimator is placed between pic 1
ngn the prism and the source as shown in fig
4 in the principal focus of its objective is placed
a narrow straight slit with movable metal jaws the source
is now ilaced immediately back of this slii or the
image of the source is focused upon the slit by
means of a lens awtd the image lens when the
slit is properly placed and illumi nated the collimator will
emit from each point of the slit a beam of
nearly parallel lit whose d google 8pbctroscopy 87s crosssection is
equampl to the eflecdve aperture of the abjective if now
this emergent beam be cxunined throu a prism and the
naked eye as before a senes of colored images of
the slit will be seen each appearing to be at
an infinite distance from the observer and if the slit
is narrow these images will be sharp and fine and
easily separated but they will not in general appear very
bright because the rture of the human eye is too
small to ad roit more than a fraction of the
emergent beam accordingly these colored images each at an infinite
distance are viewed througli a small astronomical telescope called the
view tele kope this serves to condense the entire beam
whicli emerges from the prism and reduce it to another
parallel beam just large enough to fill the aperture of
the average tuimim eye ftc s tha kctnjgiuli this smm

gcnnanyj when it is desired to photograph a spectrum the
view telescope is removed and is replaced by a camera
with a photographic objective such an instrument is known as
a spectrograph and an excellent modern form of it is
illus trated in fig 5 when the typical spectroscope represented
in fig 4 is provided with a graduated circle and
so arranged that the view telescope and the prism can
rotate about the axis of the divided circle the instrument
is known as a spectrom eter and can be employed
for the measure ment of prismangles and wavelengths as well
as for the examination of spectra in this type of
spectroscope it is nearly always necessary for the sake of
good definition to place the prism in such a posiiioii
that it will produce a minimum deviation in the incident
pencil of rays for it is proved in geometrical optics
that a homocentric pencil will remain homo centric after passing
through a prism only pro vided the prism is placed
in its position of minimum deviation if the prism be
set in any other position the itnage of a pointsource
will not be a point but a line resolving povotr
of a prism if one had a prism spectroscope which
was practically per fect so far as all the optical
parts are con cerned he would yet find that the
ability of the prism to separate lightwaves of different lengths
was subject to still another limitation a limitation which arises
ultimately from the fact that lightwaves have an appreciable length
this ability to separate radiations is known as resolving power
and is measured by the ratio j where w is
the difference of the wave length and i the mean
wavelciigth of two spec tral lines which can just be
resolved by the dispersion piece in question rayleigh has proved
that a prism can just resolve two lines when the
difference of their refractive indices is given by the following
equation lt where h and i are the thickness of
glass traversed by the extreme rays on either side of
a parbllel beam passing through the prism if now gt
be expressed in terms of ltw by means of a
dispersion formula such as the fol lowing due to cauchy
we have p 4 j and l where a and
b are constants depending upon the idnd of glass employed
in the prism from these it follows that the resolving
power r for prism is n xt this equation is
fundamental in describing the spectroscopic value of a prism it
means that the resolving power varies directly as the width
of the prism and inversely as the cube of the
wavelength of the light examined it tells us also just
how thick a prism of any given glass must be
at its base in order to separate two lines having
a given difference of wavelength the prism spectroscope was lirst
effectively used by fraunhofer 1817281 but it was not until
1859 that kirchhoff and bunsen demonstrated the power of the
instrument in chemical an alysis and in a study of
the suns physical the grating spectroscope so far as its
auxiliary parts are concerned this piece of ap paratus is
very like the prism spectroscope but as regards its essential
feature the dispersing piece the two instruments are radically differ
ent for the dispersion which is produced by a prism
rests ultimately upon the fact that waves of longer length
travel through glass at a higher speed than those of
sorter length while the dispersing effect of a krating is
due to the fact that when waves of different lengths
are forced to pass through a narrow opening they are
all spread out like a fan diffracted the longer waves
being more suread out how ever than the shorter ones
if a gas flame turned low or an incandescent elcctnc
lamp be examined through a single narrow slit in a
vis iting card a number of spectra will be seen
on each side of a central bright image these have
been called by fraunhofer spectra of the first class they
are not used in spectroscopy if however the same source
of light be viewed through two or more fine parallel
equidistant slits placed close together say less than one sixtyfourth
inch apart another series of spectra will be observed these
are the combined ellcct of lirfit passing through several openings
they are known as spectra of the second class and
are practically the only ones in the grating spectroscope tese
narrow equidistant parallel slits were first prepared by fraunhofer 1821
who formed them by wrapping fine wire over the thread
of two parallel screws then solder ing the wires to
the screws and cutting away one entire side of the
little cage thus formed such a device he called a
grating the modem grating is made by ruling straight lines
whh a diamond point on a flat plate of highly
polished dgt google 8pbctroscopt specnhim metal good gratings have usually
from 5000 to 20000 lines per inch here ihe light
is reflected from the unruled surface be tween two successive
furrows made by the diamond and diffraction occurs exactly as
if the light had passed through a narrow aperture of
the same width such a device is called a reflection
grating and when placed where the prism stands in an
ordinary prism spectroscope we have what is called a gratink
spectroscope when a beam of parallel rays emerges from the
collimator and fails upon a grating placed with its rulings
parallel to the siit of the col limator part of
the light is reflected according to the laws of ordinary
reflection and forms in the focal plane of ihe viewtelescope
what is known as the central image the remainder of
the liht however is spread out on either side of
this central image the blue light being de viated least
and the red light longest waves being deviated most unlike
the prism the gratm yields several spectra distributed on each
side of the centra image if monochromatic light be viewed
with such an instrument a series of bright lines sharp
maxima each an image of the slit will be seen
distributed on each side of the central image the image
nearest the central one is said to be of the
rst order the next of the second order etc the
properties of these images and of diffraction spectra in general
are most briefly described by the following three equa tions
which follow directly from the wave the ory of light
a b sin i 3meml eq agt here o h
fc is the distance between corre sponding points on two
consecutive rulings the socalled grating constant the angle of incidence
is denoted by t the angle of diffrac tion by
e the order of the spectrum by m and the
wavelength by s this equation tells us exactly in what
position 8 we must set the viewtelescope in order to
observe a line of any given wavelength conversely it enables
us to compute the wavelength when once we know the
grating constant and the directions of the incident and diffracted
rays nfja 2 b sn m a h eqb here
is the intensity of the spectrum of a monchromatic source
of wavelength a in any given direction produced by a
grating which has n lines ruled upon it at a
uniform distance ffl 6 apart r is the intensity which
a single aperture would give in the same direction the
given direction is here defined by i whose value is
meaning i grating and m is the order of spectrum
em ployed all of the best gratings of the world
up to the present time have been ruled on rowlands
dividing engines at johns hopkins university after rowlands death in
1901 his two ruling engines were not agsin used until
dr j a anderson took up this work in 1910
most of these gratings are ruled with from 5000 to
20000 lines per inch some of them have a ruled
surface six inches m width thus giving a re solving
power of no less than 400000 in the fourthorder spectrum
such a resolving power is far in excess of anytfaing
attainable with prisms of practicable size dr j a anderson
ssful i the symbols having the eq a it is
important here to observe that r a merely defines the
direction in which of eq b reaches its principal maxima
lord rayleigh has shown that the resolving power of a
grating r is defined by the follow ing simple ocpression
r miv eq c where n is the total number
of rulings on the secure this fimdamentally important part of
his apparatus at a cost which will be com paratively
only a nominal one concave grating spectroscope recent advances in
spectroscopy are due in a very large degree to the
invention of the concave grating by rowland in 1683 the
distinguishing feat ores of this instrument are that it requires
no collimator and no view tele scope and that it
gves spectra which are normal throughout a rge range the
ruling is upon a concave spherical mirror of speculum metal
the dis tance between the lines being equal when meas
ured along a chord it was with a spectograph of
this tgtpe that rowland and higgs each pre pared his
superb atlas of the solar specrtrum the same kind of
grating was also employed by kayser and runge in thrir
profound study of the spectra of the elements the echelon
spectroscope measured l resolving power the echelon devised by mi
chelson in 1898 is still a more effective instru ment
this is essentially a grating with only a few rulings
in which the form of the groove is under perfect
control this result is ob tained by nsing a pile
of plane parallel plates of equal thickness the edge of
each plate being slightly displaced over that of its preceding
neighbor the high resolving power is ob tained by use
of spectra of hi orders even as high as several
thousand the echelon is especially adapted to the separation of
the close components of a spectral line as in the
case of the zeeman effect the interferometer another device for
separating the close compound of what is or dinarily called
a single spectral line is the interferometer which is also
lareely due to michelson it is this invention which makes
it possible 10 use the wavelength of the red cad
mium ray as a standard of length instead of the
international metre at paris for michelson has shown that by
the interferometer he can meas ure wavelengths with an accuracy
of one part in a million 4 methods of recording
radiations having separated the different lines in any spec trum
the next step in general is to record the intensity
position wavelength and physical character of each of these just
how this is accomplished will depend partly upon the por
tion of the spectrvm under examination and d google svbctsoscopt
317 partly upon the pnrpose of the work if the
physical chanlcter of a line be the matter in question
a glance of the eye may be suflident to detennine
it or it may require an elaborate inveamptition by means
of the interfenmieter according to the detail and accuracy reciuired
to record the position of a line within one angstrom
unit is ordinarily the work of a few minutes but
to measure a wavelength with an accuracy of 001 angstrom
unit demands skill of the highest order and plenty of
time in general however it may be said that in
the ultraviolet ron sa from 4000 to 11000 photography is
practically the only available means for obtaining a record in
the visible portion say from asooo to a4000 the eye
and the photographic plate are each available by photograpny abney
has recorded wave lengths as great as 27000 angstrom units
in the infrared region that is for wave lengths greater
than 8000 the bolometer the radiomicrometer the radiometer and the
linear thermopile have all been used to good purpose rubens
employing a linear thermopile has pushed his measures to ijooo
but photog raphy is probably more used than all other
methods put togetner s comparison and interpretation of radi ations
let us suppose that the lines in the spectrum of
a certain body have been analyzed and recorded it may
be only for the moment on the retina of the
eye ii may be permanently upon a photographic plate the
next step is to ply this infonnation to the purpose
for which it was obtained to this end the observer

be ftankly admitted that this is the moat difficult part
of the entire subject demanding as it does wide experience
in the laboratory ana judgment of the highest order apparently
no theory is 0 fanciful but it may find some
sup port among the varied and complex phenomena presented by
the spectroscope the science of ttica is controlled by a
wellestablished dieory while spectrobccy must still be classed as an
almost purely empirical science amp sumnuuy of prindplm there ar
however some general principles which have been fairly well established
following are the more important ones spectra of gases the
emission spectrum of a gas can be obtained in gener
only by passing an electric current through the gas the
emission spectrum of a gas is practically always a spectrum
of bright lines the emis sion spectra of solids and
liquids are practically always continuous as illustrating excepdons to this
general law may be cited the fact that paschen using
the bolometer has obtained the characteristic radiations of carbonic acid
gas heated by streaming through a hot platinum spiral also
the fact that the spectra of gases under very high
ptessures become nearly con kirchhoffs lata let us denote by
h the amount of radiant energy say heat or light
of any one wavelength which falls upon a body at
temperature t in one second let a denote the energy
of the same wavelength which this body absorbs in one
second when at the same temperature the ratio hh is
what kirchhoff calls the sorption of the body and is
de noted by a bod which absorbs all the heat
falfing upon it is said to be absolutely black its
absorption is unity let us now denote by the amount
of energy of the same wave length which this same
body would radiate ia one second this quantity is called
the emib sion of the body now kirchhos in 1859
proved that by means of these two general prindplm kirchhoff
was enabled to explain the fact that a sodium ftame
placed between one carbon pole of an electric arc and
the slit of the spectroscope will produce two dark absorption
imes in the orange of the continuous spectrum exactly where
without the arc it would produce two bright lines but
what is more important kirchhoff succeeded in explaining on these
same principles the dark lines which frauohofcr mapped in the
spectrum of the sun the con tinuous part of the
solar spectrum is supposed lo be due to the bright
underlying layers of the sun which are under great pressure
while the dark lines the socalled fraunhofer lines are due
to absorption of the cooler gases which surround the sun
in the same manner may be explained the dark lines
which appear in several classes of stellar spectra doppurs principlt
li we denote by the apeed with which any radiant
source is ap proaching the observer by v the speed
of light and n the number of waves of length
x emittea per second by the source then it is
evident that the n vibrations which the source emits in
any one second will be distributed over a dis tance
numerically equal to v v hence the wavelength of the
light a which reaches the observer will be it is
evident therefore that the wavelengths of jii coming from a
star which it proaching d google 8pbctroscopt the observer will
be shortened in the ratio p in like manner if
a star be receding f from the spectroscope ihe wavelengths
will be increased in the ratio p this principle first
enunciated by doppler in 1843 enables the astrophysicist to measure
rales of ap proach and recession recent work by frost
and adams shows that the speed of a star in
the line of sight can be determined with an error
not exceeiung onehalf mile per second in like manner the
relative motion of the two limbs of the sun and
of several of the planets and hence their periods of
rotaiioitj have been determined by the spectroscope even in the
very faint spiral nebulas the rotation and the nature of
their motions in space can in some cases be found
thus throwing a fkiod of light on the nature of
these bodies and on the pos sible development of stars
from them ebrti of prtssure in 1895 it was proved
by humphreys and mohler from measurements made in the physical
laboratory of johns hop kins university that the wavelength of
a line in the spectrum of any element is dependent
upon the pressure of the medium surrounding the source thus
when the cadmium arc is worked under a pressure of
10 atmospheres the cad mium lines are shifted toward the
red end of the spectrum about 007 of an angstrom
unit in general the amount of this shift is toward
the red directly proportional to the wave lengths in any
one element and directly pro portional to the excess of
pressure above one atmosphere effect of atmosphere surrounding source it
has been shown by crew basquin porter and hartman that
the spectrum of an electric arc between two metailic electrodes
is very distinctly affected by surrounding it with an atmosphere
other than air in the case of hydrogen it has
been shown that the lines affected by the hydrogen atmosphere
belong to the spark spectrum of the metal it is
also true that the lines which belong to kayser and
runges series are not affected by the change from air
to hydrogen it has been suggested that this effect may
account for the peculiar bpectra of many of the socalled
hydrogen stars that is stars in which the hydrogen spectrum
is very strong the zeeman effect in 1896 zeeman then
at leyden made the capital discovery that if a source
of radiation he placed in a magnetic field each individual
line in its spectrum will in general become a triplet
with the two side components circularly polarized and the mid
die component plane polarized temperature effects the role which tem
perature plays in the production of line spectra is very
little understood it is at present im possible to say
to what extent the various char acteristics of lame arc
or spark spectra depend upon temperature upon cncmical action and
upon electrical conditions but in the case of solid bodies
which yield a continuous spectrum stefan showed in 1879 that
the total radiation varies as the fourth power of the
absolute tem perature and it has since been established by
wien that if we denote absolute temperaluru by t rconstant
and mr constant wnere indicates the vavelengtb at which the
radiation is a maximuin and in rresents he value of
the maximum radiation these two important laws are merely inferences
from a still more general expression which wien has established
law of spectral seriex soon after the dis covery was
made that there exist in the spectra of the elements
certain series of lines distin guished by certain common characteristics
bal mer succeeded in devising a single formula which gives
in a very exact manner the wave length of each
of the hydrogen lines known to him at that time
the expressionis as fouowe where is a constant and m
denotes the nat ural niunbers benning with 3 this for
mula has since shown itself competent to de scribe accurately
the 29 hydrogen lines which are now known in 1888
kayser and runge began a remaiii able study of the
arc spectra of many of the more important elements and
showed that most of these elements contain one or more
series of unes capable of rqgtresentatidq hy the fol lowing
formula lab c in which a b and c are
constants for eadi series and m denotes the natural numbers
be ginning with 3 each different chemical element has its
own different characteristic values for these three constants this fact
is the founda tion of spectrum analysis rydberg has shown
that the following ex pression is equally effective in representing
the 171 where a b and are constants for each
series while x and m have their previous meanings thus
in the case of mg zn and cd there are
six such series in each case equivalent to two series
of triplets it is to be hoped that this great
advance will be followed some day by a dyiiaraical explanation
of the vibrating atom which will indude these two formula

speech the producdon of articulate sounds by the voice organs
it consists in tones of vtnce modified by the agen
of the tongue cheeks lips and other structures intervening between
the glottis and the outer opening of the mouth the
modifications of articulate sounds which may be invented and used
by man are almost without limit the modifica tions actually
used in the ordinary speech of all mankind numbers at
least a thousand and a universal language would have to
provide symbols representauve of that many speech sounds nevertheless the
number of distinct sounds in any one laiuage seldom exceeds
50 in english speech two classes of sounds are produced
known as vowels and consonants voweis are pronounced by sounds
coming pri marily from the larynx consonants are formed by
sounds due to interruption of the currents of air in
the mouth or passages above the larynx the name consonant
denotes a sound that cannot be produced effectively without the
aid of a vowel the vowels are further dis tinguished
by the fact that they can be sounded mutely or
in a whisper the differences be tween vowel sounds are
owing to differences in the dimensions of the space between
tongue and palate mouth cavity and of the mouth opening
when the vowels are pronounced as shown in the following

incm 2 i vowels sounds can be prolonged indefi nitely
so may some consonants as 1 m n r s

g hard cannot be prolonged absence of the sense of
hearing prevents the perception of sounds and also their imitation
hence persons bom deaf are necessarily dumb but through training
such persons may acquire the power of speech where dumbness
exists without deafness the affection is due to some disorder
of the nerve centres see language science of voice and
voice culture speech defectb of speech is an ex tremely
complex and intricate mechanism and in the normal adult represents
a large number of various factors its defects therefore are
equally complex in ordinary speech at least three separate types
of processes are involved 1 sensory 2 motor and 3
intellectual or associalional 1 the sensory mechanism of speech in
cludes all the avenues by which the idea of a
verbally expressible picture can get into the brain the eye
and the ear are mostly used because with these senses
the pictures are most distinct tut touch smell or other
sense if recognized may be of use in the faculty
of speech thus with the sensory portion of the speechmechanism
the intellectual factor must necessarily be joined one sees the
words on a printed page and pronounces them but if
written in a script to the reader unknown he can
see the characters and yet will not be ablp to
utter the sounds they represent 2 the motor side of
speech implies a the ability to use the muscles of
speech and b the power of coordinating those muscles so
as to say the right things the lips the dgt
google 380 spbbch dwbctfi op tongue the latynx the teeth
are the organs moatljr used in speech one may say
ihat in deafmutes the hands are organs of speech the
nerves that govern the muscles ordinarily nsed in speech are
the motor cranial nerves the nuclei of which are located
in the medulla oblongata qv but the centre that coordi
nates their movements with the sensory impres sions which come
in through the oians of special sense as well as
with the intellectual concepts concerning the thinfts seen heard or
touched is located m the third frontal convolu tion or
brocas convolution this is the chief motor centre for speech
3gt the intellectual factor in speech implies the action of
coordinating and associational fibres in the human brain that pass
from the sensory centres to the motor centres it is
the factor that governs as it were the knowledge of
what one is saying one may repeal from the hearing
a line of choctaw but without understanding it the intellectual
factor is here nonoperative memoryimages of many kinds may be
reproduced by appropriate stimuli and defects in certain parts of
the brain interfering with the bring ns out of the
memoryimages by which a sound is associated with its cause
or an object with its name occasion certain welldefiiied disorders
of speech the act of speaking therefore requires o thepower
to think or to construct an idea b the capadty
to recall and to formulate the word or words which
express the idea c the ability to artic i nntterstandable
or coit ulate the sounds in ventional manner it is
ctistomary to use the word aphasia to denominate true defects
of speech eefects in the incoming sensory tracts w4iich must
modify speech in some respects are not usually in cluded
in this category in the same manner defects in nervous
supply of the muscles of speech such as paralysis of
the tongue are not termed aphasia again a purely intellectual
defect as in idiocy whereby speech is seriously aected is
not classed as aphasic seglas has divided the disorders of
speech into three groups 1 dylogias or the disorders of
in telligence which affect speech as seen in idiots imbeciles
etc 2 dysphasias or true asections of speech aphasias the
most in teresting and complicated 3 the dysarthrias or the
disorders of articulation such as are seen in stuttering in
the peculiar speech of deafrmutes in the speech of bulbar
palsies of facial paralyses etc the aphasias are the defeas
of speech that involve the association tracts and uie sense
centres and have been loost exhaustively stud ied speaking generally
the tme aphasias may be classed in three broad groups
1 the receptive or sensory aphasias which result from some
injury to the centres for sense memories of things heard
seen smelt tasted touched etc 2 the conductionaphasias which follow

ttgtcs of aphasic disorder o speech are known and may
be summarized on the chart here given but some of
the com moner forms of aphasia may be mentioned of
the receptive or sensory type amnesic apha sia or worddeafness
is one of the most char acteristic in all of
the sensory aphasias there is a loss of comfirebcnsior of
the words heard or read in amnesic aphasia the patient
hears very distinctly eerything that is said but it might
as well be in a foreign tongue because of the
disorder of the centre for wordmemory pic tures in the
temporal convolution the patient usually speaks but makes many lapses
not knowing just what he is saying and on hearing
his own speech not understanding it many varieties of this
defect are known they should be studied in special monographs
see chart for varieties in the conduction or association aphasias
or paraphasias the asso ciationhbres connecting one speechcentre with another
arc interfered with any of the types may be present
but the form most often seen is one in which
the tracts between the auditory centres and the motor sjieechcentre
is in wolved here the patient is aware of the
words knows what they mean and tries to speak but
speaks incorrectly hts path seems to be blocked the commoner
type is motor aphasia in this brocas convolution is affected
the patient here sees and hears and compre hends but
is unable to speak the words he is likewise unable
as a rule to write the words he sees or

primitive languages are rich in bold and imaginative fiffures of
speech this is because youth is in lanuae as in
races and men the period of imagination he time when
the human mind works untrammeled by the of the knowledge
of the physical laws e the life of primitive man
was filled with images passions personal interests loves and hates
these images he was con tinually creating out of his
experiences or his want of experience the moment he departed
from the familiar facts and experiences of his life his
childish untrained mind began to picture things conditions and results
outside the common this habit of expressing out of the
ordinary feelings and conditions of ufe by out of the
ordinary forms of language has remained with the race in
its most advanced stages these figures of speech have been
modified and refined but for all this th still retain
much of the boldness of their primitive origin as the
imagery of the more primitive races is always the expression
of thoughts and images vividly in the mind and as
it is never forced it is generally true to the
thought itself and to the linage which graph ically presents
it but this is far from being true of the
imagery of more advanced races who have borrowed much from
the past often retaining the form after the cause that
called it into being has been forgotten the requi sites
of proper figures of speech exact that every comparison should
be the result of a real likeness clearly presented in
an apparently spontaneous manner it is a general rule that
the more marked the difference between the objerts compared the
greater the contrast and therefore the stronger the effect as
this effect should he practically instantaneous upon those to whom
the figure of speech is directed it follows that as
a general rule it is best not to specify difference
because these details di vert the mind from the sudden
effect desired every word that truly belongs to a language
possesses a denotative and a connotative sense the former expresses
the meaning and uses which good society has given it
the latter presents the atmosphere which clings to words causing
them to express thoughts ideas and associations apart from their
ordinary accepted use connotation gives us very often our must
suggestive and butiful figures of speech and lends to poetry
and rhetorical prose much of their attractiveness and grandeur in
treat ing of figures of speech it is customary to
divide the subject into figures of resemblance figures of contrast
and figures expressing other relations than either of the above
the figures of resemblance include the simile metaphor allegory and
personification those o con trast embrace antithesis and epigram the
third classification includes metonymy synec doche apostrophe exclamation interrogation hyperbole
climax inony vision euphemism onomatopceja litotes parallel allusion and allt
hteration a simile expresses resemblance be tween things that are
different in the meta phor this comparison is implied bat
not for mally expressed while in the allegory which is
a story couched in symbolical language the comparison is expressed
much more at length than in either the simile or
the metaphor personification on the other hand attributes life to
inanimate tluns and abstract ideas by its very boldness it
merges the idea of resemblance in the animation of the
thing personified antithesis as its name implies is a fitnire
existing by virtue of the contrast of words employed in
sentence while an epigtain though based upon conlradt is in
google speech obke8is op clined to hide this wordcontrast t
throwing the force ot the contrast upon some general idea
of contrast in the statement or situation an epigram which
formerly signified an in scription on a montiment has come
to have the sense of a brief pointed saying generally
in the nature of a pnoverb metonymy which literally means
the employment of one name for another is expressed by
substituting the container for the thing contained the sign for
the thing signified the cause for the effect or the
effect for the cause while synecdoche substitutes a part for
the whole or the whole for a part apostrophe being
simply a form of address is frequently used with other
parts of speech more especially metaphor and per son cation
it addresses the absent as if present and treats the
dead as if they were living and inanimate things as
though pos sessed of life interrogations are frequently used for
rhetorical effect rather than for the purpose of getting an
answer and in this case they form true figures lof
speech in the same way when an exclamation expresses deep
feel ing more especially in a condensed form and unusual
order it presents itself in the form of a figure
of speech because it is so arranged as to powerfully
attract the imagination hyper bole expresses that things or conditions
are better or worse greater or less than they really
are for the sake of the effect thus pro duced
it is therefore historical exaggera tion a climax presents a
series of statements or thoughts in the rising order of
their im portance when they arc presented in the decreasing
order of their importance the rhe torical figure is termed
an anticlimax irony conveys a meaning contrary to the one
sug gested by the ordinary sense of the statement vision
which frequently accompanies apos trophe and personification presents scenes as
though before the eyes although they are past or imaginary
or absent euphemism is the name given to that figure
of speech whereby an agreeabie presentation is given to something
that is in itself disagreeable onomatopceia adapts the sound of
words to their use and meaning when a statement is
made by deny ing the opposite of what is affirmed
the figure of eech thus employed is called litotes a
parallel is an extended antithesis which con tinues the comparison
of two similar objects while allusion simpiy refers tio some
familiar event or expression by way of explanation or illustration
alliteration which is frequently called a figure of emphasis is
the repetition of the same initial sound in a succession

of any part of the body compare the term gesture
lan guage while speech is applied only to ex pressive
movements of the vocal oins the term genesis is more
appropriate than ori gin because the latter implies that speech
proceeded from a condition in which speech did not exist
whereas go back as far as we may in the
evolution of animal life we shall never find a stage
in which all of the essential ele ments of speech
are absent genesis on the other hand suggests the earlier
stages of a long and continuous process of development that
eventually led to the present highly complex forms of human
speech the phrase ongin of languages sometimes occurs to express
the fact that many languages doubtless arose inde pendently in
primitive times the general problem involves two main questions 1
what was the genesis of the spewa move ments 2
how did the speech movements come to be expressive of
thought ie of sen sations ideas and feeling emotions there
is really a third question involved what is the genesis
of the ideas and emotions while ideas and feelings are
thought of not as language hut as that which is
expressed by lan guage yet it should be remembered that
the sensations of sound the kinesthetic sensations and the mental
pictures written and printed words all of which are indisputably
a part of language are mental processes of essentially the
same type as those other ideas which we usually call
thought as a matter of fact the problem of the
fienesis of speech has usu ally been confined to the
second of the above as a matter of fact all
three a essentially psychological problems it is generally held by
psychologists that every emotion and probably every other mental state
tends to pass over at oncemto movement by virtue of
the necessary relationship existing between the mental state and the
movement the latter becomes symbolic of the former ie the
movement is an expressive movement the connection between the nervous
state and move ment is very ancient or at least
has very primi tive antecedents the simplest monocellular ani mals
such as the paramedum which has not even an especially
developed nervous system responds consistently by certain definite move ments
to certain definite stimuli and even plants possess irritability that
is response to is less in plants than in animals
primarily as it would seem because their cell walls arc
more rigid than those of animals movements of the speech
organs and speech organs simitar to those of man occur
in nearly all the air brealbing animals of higher rank
than the am phibians are under the same kind of
nervous control as all other muscular movements as the movements
of all animals and even of plants are primarily lifeserving
movements it is natu hction a of th google speech
genesis op ral to suppose that all movements had their
ori gin in responses to environoient of such a char
acter as to continue the life process a plant turns
to the light which is the source ot the energy
by whidi it makeii its food the para mecium swims
away from a poisoned area in the water and moves
toward its food perhaps chemical and mechanical laws account for
these movements in the case of the lowest animals that
possess lungs and a larynx the power of developed nervous
system all animals that possess a larynx make with it
movements which produce air vibrations of frequency within the range
that is appreciable through the ear as sound birds and
quadrupeds pro dtice loud and complex sounds which appear to
play an important part in lives of these ani mals
undoubtedly man inherited from his prehuman ancestors the power of
producing sounds by the movements of his laryngeal and breathing
muscles the range of sounds which animals arc capable of
producing with their vocal organs is far greater than has
usually been supposed this fact is fully eslabhshed in the
case of apes which have been more fully investigated in
this respect some scholars have assumed that the cod ings
gurglings and musical notes made by in fants in such
great variety before they learn to speak represent a condition
in which primitive man found himself before speech was devel
oped on the contrary these infant cries are doubtless the
outcome of a high state of devel opment of the
laryngeal muscles and extensive nervous connections which the cnild inherited
froni his parents in whom the power of speech was
of course highly developed it would be valuable to know
now an infants vocal move ments compare in complexity with
those of an ape phonograph records could be made of
both whether the prehuman was capable of using his speech
organs for die expression of thought is a question which
we can answer to no fuller degree than we can
solve the same question in the case of animals a
fundamen tal question is whether animals and therefore prefiumans creatures
higher than existing animals and still lower than man had
the capacity to think vpsychologists who have especially investigated the
mental processes of animals believe that the more intelligent ani
mals rats for example perform with their brains all the
different kinds of process that men perform the chief difference
between he animals and men being one of relative antedated
language in the evolutionary process or viceversa all that seems
positively afhrm able on this point is hat language ie
ex pressive movements and intellectual life de veloped side by
side neither preceeded the other indeed the two together form
one com plex psychophysical process ideas and feel ings are
as inconceivable without expressive movement as is expressive movement without
ideas and feelings to be expressed we may assume that
an animals movements are a fairly adeauate expression of his
mental life just as the more elaborate vocal movements of
man arc a fairly adequate expression of his more complex
mental aaivities the problem as to how speech movements and
their resulting sounds gained meaning has been the subject of
very extensive discussion the problem arises from the fact that
while most expressive movements other than speech and not based
upon it contain within themselves some element or elements more
or less directly related to the meaning and naturally suggestive
of it iii the case of speech movements no such
relationship exists except in a small group of onomalopo etic
words in which however the relationship is merely secondary ie
not between the move ment and the meaning but between
the sound which is a secondary product of the move
ment and the meaning for example neither the movements of
the vocal organs which form the word dog nor the
sounds of the word nor yet the written or printed
symbol bear the faintest resemblance to the object signified latin
cants german hund french ckieti and russian sobaka words entirely
different in movement sound and appearance and likewise bearingno resemblance
to a dog serve equally well the connection between the
movement and the meaning is purely arbitrary on the other
hand a gesture such as poinung is uni versal amotw
men and is intelligible every where further when an indian
puts two fin gers of one band astride one finger
of the other to indicate a man on horseback or
when he puts his hand over his head to signify
white man ie one who wears a hat the connection
is still clear various attempts have been made to ac
count for this arbitrary assodational coimec tion between movement and
meaning 1 some scholars bridged the gap by assuming that
the creator implanted the gift of speech in man this
in its literal sense is of course absurd equally absurd
though not so con zcuously absurd is 2 another fiat
view of case which assumes that groups of men came
together and by deliberate choice selected certain sounds to express
certain meanings such an act is conceivable only among men
who already possess the power of speech with more justification
as might superficially ap pear it has been urged that
3 men imitated characteristic sounds produced by objects in the
outside world the socalled bowwow or onomatopoetic theory more far
fetched is the suggestion that men 4 naturally rang out
the sound characteristic of an object when struck the dinpdong
theory others as sumed that 5 instinctive cries came to
be associated with and hence to symbolize the situ ation
or object which produced them poobl pooh theory all these
theories must be regarded as at tempts to conjecture how
speech might con ceivably have arisen instead of as anything
even remotely approaching a scientific demon stration of how ltpeech
actually did arise against the third theory it may be
urged that at best it would account for the origin
of but very few words furthermore it has been shown
that of even this relatively small num ber of words
some have attained an onomato eaetic character in comparatively recent
times iving arisen by changes of movement from words that
formerly had quite different sounds and hence could not be
used to substantiate this dgt google in so far as
these theories attempt lo assign a method of origin to
individual words they are open to the objeciion that while
we cannot say positively what type or types of thought
were employed during primitive incipient stages of human or prehuman
speech still in all like lihood in these earlier stages
and this seema to hold true of animals also man
had occasion to express only masses of ideas whole situa
tions as yel unanalyzed into detailed ideas such as are
expressed by most modern words a difficulty of the last
theory lies in the relatively small number of emotional cries
foiuid in a single individual unless we include the mean
ingless cries of children mentioned above with the conseouent objections
the last theory also assumes the existence of speech sounds
before thought which as was stated above is as un
tenable as the converse assumption in contrast with these five
theories a more icientiiic attempt to explain the arbitrary con
nection between speech movements and mean ing regards the former
like other gestures as previously useful life serving f n
scott in publications of the modem language as sociation of
america has called attention to a varies of such movements
of the speech or gans for example panting gasping grunting
sneezing coughing choking etc the closing of the glottis necessarily
precedes all great muscular efforts of the body the cessation
of such efiort is followed by its opening the necessity
of breathing during the strain neces sitates gasping many such
movements occur in typical situations and in accordance with the
normal working of the mental processes would soon become closely
associated with them movements of the speech organs productive of
sound waves occur also in connection with other movements tnat
are life serving pant ing for example follows upon alt
vigorous exercise the sounds thus produced through association with the
movements which produce them and furtjier with the movements which
the latter accompanj become also associated with and hence significant
of the general situation under which they arise in the
cases men tioned the connection between the two groups of
concomitant movements is purely physical there are however other groupings
the congt netrtion betwecn which lies m ihc nervous sys
tem such secondarily produced movements ltwheiher of the vocal organs
or other muscles are explained by psychologists as due to
the overflow of exceptionally intense feeling into other nervous channels
than those within which they would naturally he supposed to
be con fined instances of such complexes of move ment
occur in animals this view provides no final explanation however
because it at once suggests the question why and how
the nervous connection between the two movements arose ie why
the overflow look originally the pre cise channel which it
did on the other hand there are soundproduc ing vocal
movements which may be instinctive in origin and which are
also useful in that they contribute to the survival of
the individual and hence of the race the various calls
of animals arc of this land signifying as they do
dan ger 1 food etc prehumans doubtless pos sessed such
calls assuming that these move ments rcprescntelti in their earlier
stages unan alyied general situations it is easy to see
how as mental powers developed in complexity and tile consequent
analysis of the general situa tions brought specific elements into
clearer con sciousness the kcihc dominadng elements rather than the
general conwlex came to be symbolized by the vocal movements
thus ving origin to expressions more akin in meaning to
the majority of existing words in general it may be
said that the methods of madem science as applied both
in psychol ogy and in linguistic stujy constrain the stu
dent of the genesis of speech to confine himself in
his search for positive evidence to such lin guistic processes
as occur in the experience of people now living this
is the only kind of firsthand evidence which can be
fully studied by direct examination and which admits of even
approximately exact scientific control thus the which one may draw
inferences as t ditions that prevailed in earlier times prob
ably we shall never be able to reconstruct sudi primitive
conditions in detail we will be lim ited to the
possession of certain general truths concerning their nature in all
study of this subject furthermore one must be continually guided
