improve ments in transportation communication and to international dimensions when
however there are suikcient plants constructed to more than supply
any circle of the market and com petition is reduced
to a few industrial units the wastes of competition and
the destrucrire ness of oompetitive war become so evident that
combination is inevitable the result is some one of the
various forms of combination by which competition is stifled and
monopoly es tablished the wageworkers seek political victory in order
that they may impress their interests upon the social organism
and thereby remove the evils under which they sufler at
the present time since most of the evils rof which
they complain spring from the fact that they are debarred
from access to natural resources and the in struments for
the production and distribution of wealth their first demand is
that such access be freely granted but free access implies
legal ownership and with modern concentrated com plex industry this
ownership cannot be indi vidual unless all the evils of
the present system are retained hence we have a demand
for collective ownership thus socialism as a philosophy is mainly
an analysis of capitalism as an ideal as a social
stage it presupposes the capitalist system since that can alone
prepare the way for sodalism d google this future system
or ideal is in no sense of the word a
scheme whose adoption is asked for by the socialists it
is simply the next logical stage in social evolution socialists
do not attempt therefore to give any details of that
future society since all such details will be deipendent upon
the decision of a majority of the working class of
that future time and upon the stage of industrial development
which has been attained when socialism is ushered in since
both of these factors are manifestly im possible of being
ktiown at the present time any attempt to forecast their
outcome would be equally impossible all that can be said
is that present tendencies of social development show what must
be a few of the general features of the next
soda stage sodalista maintain that the coming society will be
preferable to the present one especially for the working class
with a collective demo craticalty managed organization of industry in
which natural resources and the mechanical means for the production
and distribution of wealth have their ownership vested in society
and where production is for the direct use of the
producers and not for sale the wastes of the present
system will be largely abolished among these wastes which will
be abolished are advertising duplication of plants and power poor
utilization of mechanical progress disad vantageous geographical location of industries
etc some of these are already being abolished by the
trust method of production but at the present time the
saving accomplished redounds almost wholly to the benefit of the
few owners of the trustified industry in addition to this
socialists maintain that much greater savings would be made under
socialism by the utili ra tion in productive labor of
the energies of whole classes of the population from whose
strength and ability society at present derives little or no
advantage this would be true for example not alone of
the present arirr of the unemployed amounting in the united
slates to between 1000000 and 3000000 accord ing to industrial
conditions but also the purely capitalist class whose functions of
ownership being performed collectively would enable the members of that
class to directly assist in production ry far the larger
share of that portion of the population concerned in the
protection of individpal property rights in what socialism would make
collective prop erty such as lawyers jutees police private watchmen
detectives and the army antl navy could also be changed
into productive workers socialists also claim that in a cooperative
society the sum total of human happiness would be immensely
increased by making the produc tion of goods in itself
pleasurable when profit and the oompetilive struggle are abolished and
productive energies fully utilized there will be a possibihty of
that leisurely artistic creative ac tivity which modern psychology and
pedagogy agree is capable of furnishing die most intense pleasure
and valuable educational training to the individual worker while at
the same time pro ducing the best possible goods for
the satisfac tion of human needs it is this phase
of social ism which has always attracted artists and has
given rise to the now extensive arts and crafts movement
it is easy to see in this connection that socialism
would offer a much greater field voku 13 for the
development of individuauty than is possible for the great mass
of the people to day the theory of socialism is
itself a product of evolution the ideal appearing long before
the philosophy of society and the scientific analysis of socnal
relations which make possible the realization of that ideal were
worked out ever since the days of plato and especially
since the writing of sir thomas mores utopia men have
dreamed of a society which should be a co operative
brotherhood during the latter part of the 18th and first
half of the 19th century ntopian socialism reached a high
degree of de velopment and found numerous illustrious fol lowers
among these were fourier babauf saint simon and cabet in
eurtgie and a few years later greeley dana and nathaniel
haw thorne in america robert owen marked some what of
an advance on this position while he founded colonies and
pictured utopias he also set forth many ideas that have
since become a part of modern scientific socialism lassalle rodbertus
and weithng in germany colins and de paepe in belgium
also helped to some de gree to formulate present socialist
philosophy while they also partook of a utopian character it
is with the work of karl marx qv and friedrich
engels gv however that modem socialism ben definitely to take
on the forms by which it is known today in
1845 marx was ordered out of paris and went to
brussels where he was joined by engels and where they
founded the german workingmens asso ciation with the deutsche brusseler
zeitung as its organ it was while here that they
became members of the communist leagiie and wrote ihe communist
manifesto to which reference was previously made a philosophical and
a political goal pre supposes an organization for proiganda and
political activity the body that is generally looked upon as
the ancestor of the present worldwide socialist organizations is the
league of the lust organized in paris in 1836 the
aims of this organization were however very indefinite and its
principal significance lies in its transformation in 1847 into the
com munist league this change was brought about through the
influence of marx and en gels while the communist league
exercised considerable influence on continental labor movements during tht first
two or three years of its existence yet it was
overwhelmed in the reaction which followed the revolutions of 1848
and by 18s3 it had practically disappeared its great contribution
to socialism lies in the fact that under its auspices
was issued a document that for farreaching consequences and lasting
influence must be considered one of the most remarkable ever
written this was the com munist manifesto drawn up by
marx and en gels as a committee of the communist
league in 1848 this work consists of a snmmmty of
the philosophy of sociahsm and has been trans lated into
almost every known language and still constitutes the most genertlly
circulated work on socialism in existence new editions and translations
appear continually ttitoughoul the world the next great step was
the organ ization of the international working mens association qv
at saint martins hall lon don 8 sept 186 a
committee appointed at d google 164 this meeting and composed
of 50 members representing six nationalities presented a dec laration
of principles which was wriiteta by karl marx and which
was unanimously accepted by the organiiation since this declaration has

of the inler national anarchistic forces under the leader ship
of bakounin threatened to gain control and in order to
avoid this catastrophe the socialists who were stilt in the
majority voted to remove the headquarlers of the organization from
london to new york there was another purpose in his
also it was felt by marx and others that since
the doctrines of socialism had been included in various national
workingmens movements and had been somewhat systematized by the discussions
of the congress that the time for a great centralized
organization was past and that its disappearance would be the
best thine possible the next 20 years saw the growth
of power ful national socialist movements but with no centralized
international organization at the end of that period these parties
felt the need of some sort of cooperation and united
in the first of a series of international congresses at
paris 14 july 1889 the new international was a creation
of the national bodies and not a centralized organization having
control of branches in various nations at this first meet
ing differences developed so great that two congresses instead of
one were held although some of the delegates participated in
the meet ings of both bodies two years later at
the congress of brussels this breach was at least fartially
healed and it gradually disappeared n 1896 the old conflict
with anarchistic ele ments arose but was settled by the
adoption of a resolution excluding from subsequent con gresses those
who repudiate political action the congress of paris 1900 laid
the founda tion of a new permanent international socialist posed
of permanent delegates from each coun try the larger nations
electing two and the smaller one a chairman and secretary
were also elected and brussels chosen as the sea of
the international secretarial with the out break of the european
war in 1914 socialism attracted more general attention than at
any previous time in its history manv people had oped
that by concerted action the socialists of germany would be
able to prevent that countrys entering the war soon after
the declaration of war it was found that practically all
of the socialist parties in the warring coun tries had
cast in tneir lot witti their govern ments for 50
years before the war socialist congresses and socialist periodicals had
dis cussed the problem of war from every possible standpoint
and recognised it and the hostile feeling between nations as
he greatest obstacles to the develcmeni of a worldwide social
democracy tne causes of modern wars ac cording to a
leading american socialist are as follows the basic cause is
capitalism the contributory causes are imperialism mili tarism social unrest
international grudges and pseudopatriotism in 1907 the intemational socialist congress
was held at stuttrt and is memorable for the antiwar
resolution passed after considerable discussion between bebel jaures vandervelde and
others the terms of this resolution named capitalism as the
cause of war and stated that the workers of the
world are the natural enemies of war an ad ditional
formulation proposed by rosa lux emburg lcnine and martoff is
illuminating in view of subsequent events it is as follows
in case a war should nevertheless break out the socialists
shall take measures to bring about its early termination and
strive with all their power to use the economic and
political crises created by the war to arouse the masses
politically and hasten the overthrow of capitalist class rule this
threat was incorporated in tbe stuttgart resolution and was adopted
at the congress of basel in 1912 among the means
proposed to avert war were a general international strike the
refusal of money for military supplies and a general antimilitary
agitation the intemational congress of co penhagen in 1910 modified
somewhat the pro posals of previous congresses and was un
doubtedly less anti militaristic than its predeces sors an intemational
congress was to meet in vienna in august 1914 but
the outbreak of hostiuties prevented its convening the inter national
socialist bureau with headturtcrs at brussels suspended its activities in
july 1914 vandervelde chairman of the bureau became a member
of the belgian government and the bureau was removed to
the hague here a conference of socialists from neutral states
denmark sweden holland argentina and the united slates was held
on 30 july and 1 and 2 aug 1914 it
passed resolutions blaming capitalism for the war and advocated free
trade and a democratization of power socialists from the belligerent
countries met for the first time at the zimmermann jswitzer
land confess in september 1915 the same representatives met at
kicnthal 2430 april 1916 much opposition and factionalism fol lowed
tbe proposal to renew the international d google 106 and
to attempt a discuson of the peace prob lem in
which the german delegates would take part in 1917 leading
socialists of the world sroposed a peace congress to be
held at stock olm the movement was initiated by the
russian council of workmens and soldiers delates immediately the austrian
and ger man socialists drew np a peace program in
which the main points were no annexations no indemnities much
discussion ensued in the entente countries relative to the panting
of passports to delegates to the stockholm conference ultimately passports
were refused delegates in france great britain italy and the
united states the stockholm conference was consequently not fullv representative
and while it did not succeed in its peace program
it certainly gave an impulse to the pacifist move ment
in the warring countries the progress of the war and
its conclusion gave a great im petus to socialism which
spread more rapidly than ever before and came into power
in sev eral of the larger countries of europe germany
germany for a long time led the socialist movement of
the world in the number of votes representatives in parliament
press and literature on the theoretical side german socialist thought
has often been traced back to hegel and fichte winkelblech
better known as karl mario rodbertus and weit ling also
developed ideas of collectivism and premises in economics that were
later incor porated in socialist doctrine it is only with
ferdinand lassalle however that such theories were linked up with
an actual working class movement lassalle was bom at breslau
11 april 1s25 studied first at the trade school at
leipzig and then took up philology and philos ophy at
breslau and berlin passmg his exami nations with distinction he
became involved in the working class revolts of 1848 and
came into slight contact with marx and engels althoih there
is little evidence that he was greatlv infiuenced by them
it was not until 1862 that he delivered his famous
lecture on the labor program before an artisans associ ation
in berlin the published copies of this lecture were seiied
by the police and lassalle was arrested at bis trial
he delivered a speech which was destined to become under
the title science and the workingman one of the classics
of early socialism in response to an invitation to address
the leipzig working mens association he sent his open reply
letter in which he further explained his erltram and philosophy
he set forth his ad erence to the ricardian theory
of the iron law of wages which was later to
become a bone of contention in socialist circles he urged
the formation of productive associations of work ingmen for which
he held the state should provide the capital to secure
this end he de clared thai the working classes must
consti tute themselves into an independent political party and must
make universal equal and direct suffrage their watchword the represen
tation of the working classes in the legislative bodies of
germany that alone can satisfy their legitimate interests in a
political sense on 19 may 1863 the congress of workingmen
at frankfortonmain adopted lassalle s program and four days later
the universal german workinmens association which was later to develop
mto the german social democracy was founded lassalle however was
destined to see small fruits from his work after a
few months of tireless energetic eloquent agitation with apparently small
results he was drawn into a duel on a purely
personal matter was fatally wounded and died 31 aug 1864
for a time considerable confusion existed the in ternational workingraens
association whose organization at london in 1864 has already been
described began to have an influence in ger many wilheim
liebknecht was its nrincipal worker many of the principles of
the marxian economics which had been accepted by the in
ternational were opposed to the doctrines of lassalle this was
particularly true of the state assisted productive associations in 1867
uni versal suffrage was granted for the north ger man
reichstag and the socialists polled between 30000 and 40000 votes
electing six members among whom was august bebel who never
ceased to play a prominent part in german so cialism
and who had been converted by lieb knecht to the
marxian position and the support of the international in 1869
at eisenach the marxian wing organized the sozial demokrat ische
arbeiler partei for the next few years the strife between
the eisenachers and the las salleans was violent this however
did not srevent the rapid growth of socialism and in
874 331670 votes were cast for the socialist candidates three
lassalleans and seven eisen achers including bebel and liebnecht both
of whom were in prison for alleged treasonable ut terances
during the francoprussian war were elected to the reichstag this
great success brought down the wrath of the governing pow
ers and a period of persecution began the first effect
of which was to close up the breach be tween
the two socialist parties at the congress of gotha in
may 1875 this union was fol lowed by a rapid
increase in the socialist vote which by 1877 had reached
nearly 500000 meanwhile bismarck was bending every energy to force
repressive measures through the reichstag it is probable that he
would have failed in this had it not been that
two insane persons attempted to assassinate the emperor bismarck at
once declared that these attacks were inspired by the socialists
although there was never the slitest evidence to justify this
assertion however he at once dissolved the reichstag and by
means of the most inflamma tory appeals to public prejudice
succeeded in getting a majority subservient to his purposes a
law was forced throu which practically out lawed the entire
socialist movement it prohib ited the formation or existence of
organisations which sought by social democratic socialistic or anarchistic movements
to subvert the pres ent state and social order provision
was also made that where even these very stringent mea
sures were ineffective any city could be declared in a
minor state of siege in which all public activity was
directly controlled by the police the socialists at once determined
upon a policy of shamming dead the orn of the
socialist party was transferred to switzerland and from there circulated
in great numbers throughout germany the only attempt at public
propa ganda within germany was through the speeches of the
socialist members in the reichstag at the first election taking
place under this reign of terror in 1881 it appeared
as if the policy of suppression was succeeding as the
socialist d google 186 vote m to a little over
300000 from that time on howerer and in spite of
oppression the party grew by leaps ana bounds until in
1890 it polled 1427298 votes jt being manifestly im eossible
to continue to consider a million and a alf of
voters as outlaws the a nti socialist law was allowed
lo lapse in march 1890 and bismarck was dismissed as
minister from that time to the present the socialist movement
has continued to grow the method of repression having failed
to destroy the socialist movement the new emperor extended the
policy inaupurated by bismarck when his laws of exception had
shown their ineftediveness and created the extensive system of social
legislation for which germany has become famous in the application
oi this lepslation the socialists and the closely affili ated
unions have played a great part with the growth of
the social democratic party to a position of power with
a vast num ber of official positions both governmental and
within its own organization diverse tendencies developed the officials have
tended to form a rit wing and with them went
a consid erable section of the newer voters especially in
south germany this section tended to relax much of the
old revolutionary position of the party and was largely responsible
for the divi sions which took place in regard to
the voting of military credits in the period immediately preceding
the war throughout the war the minority wing under haase
and lcdebour preached international socialism as of old but the
majority under scheidemann identified themselves more or less with the
imperialists and held out for a peace honorable to ger
many the minority desired an immediate peace condemned war in
general and named capitalism in all nations as the real
enemy the collapse of the empire in the fall of
1918 proved to be the longawaited opportunity of the social

demand universal and direct suffrage free dom of speech and

which the nobility ana clergy form one class the great
capitalists the second small propertyowners the third and the wageworkers
a fourth each with equal representation even under this system
the socialists succeeded in casting 750 000 votes in the
fourth class and electing 10 members of the reichsrath in
januaiy 190 as a result of a threatened general strike
the suffrage in austria was made universal and direct in
the elections held in may of the same year the
socialists cast 1041948 votes and elected 87 representatives then came
a period of reform parliamentarism which discouraged die workers so
that in 1911 although the pop ular vote was slitly
increased the number of representatives fell to 82 the party
was badly split up with nationalist quarrels and a smau
faction also split off in opposition to the war during
the first three years of the war the austrian socialists
were rendered impotent through the strong militarist policy of the
im perial government by 1918 however socialist demonstrations increased a
peace strike in volving 100000 in viemia alone was inaugurated
in january the socialists protested vigorously against the emperors instructiona
to the premier on 4 may to take measures to
prevent the reassembling of parliament the social democratic itarty on
2 june demanded the as sembling of parliament and the
initiation of teps toward peace during the summer bol shevik
influences were manifest in several parts of the empire revolutionary
activity increased and mutiny and desertion were rife in the
army the fait of the empire came on 3 november
a provisional government was organised and a republic proclaimed which
was composed of the moderate wing of the socialists in
hun gary a more radical group seized the reins of
government and chaos resulted for a lime great britain the
socialist movement in great britain has always been distinguished from
that of the continent by a greater free dom from
dogma and a greater variety of expression lliere has never
been one large unified party and socialist leslation has come
through the action of various bodies the social democratic federation
organized in 1879 and adopting a marxist platform in 1883
was the 6rst socialist party it has gone through many
changes and anally merged in the british socialist party which
split in 1915 on the question of the attitude to
be taken toward the war the independent labor party which
has never been distinctly marxian was organized in 1s93 the
fabian society organ ize in 1884 is a body of
educated writers and speakers the most prominent of whom is
ber nard shaw and which is distinctly tives of all
the foregoing organizations and also of die unions is the
political expression of the socialist movement the total membership of
the bodies united in the labor party in 1912 was
riven as 1895498 of these 1358178 were included in the
union membership and 31237 were members of the various socialist
organi zations it casts about 1000000 votes and had 40
members in the parliament which was in session during the
war the socialists of great britain were sharply divided on
the war the independent labor party fought againat the war
until it came then apposed conscrip tion and worked constantly
for peace large numbers of its membership were imprisoned for
their agitation the labor party while insisting upon its position
as a peace party generally supported the government during the
war the british socialist par split with h m hyndman
often called the father of flnglish socialism leading the prowar
faction all sections of the labor party fought continu ously
to protect worldngdass interests during the war and were almost
uniformly successful at the general election of december the labor
party did not increase its strength but it was successful
in several byelections held subse quently bejgiuin in belgium there
is but one so cialist parly the parti ouvrier beige
which was founded in 1885 for several years the franchise
was very limited and the socialists were barred from any
effective political action accordingly the early years of the party
were given up to agitation in favor of universal suf
frage this culminated in a series of great demonstrations and
finally in a general strike in 1893 which resulted in
the granting of uni versal suffrage to all males over
the a of 25 years this was much qualified for
in many elections there is a complex system of plural
voting by which those possessing property or special educational qualifications
have two or three votes while the propertyless wageworkers have
but one yet at the first election in 1894 the
socialist party polled 320000 votes and elected 28 deputies out
of 152 owing to fu sion with the liberals at
recent elections it is impossible to give the socialist vote
exactly but it is generally estimated at 500000 for die
election of 1914 when 40 socialist deputiea and four senators
were elected the principal characteristic of the belgian socialist move
ment is the peculiarly close affiliation of the three phases
of the working class movement the co05gterative trade union and
political ac tivity practically every trade unionist is also a
socialist and a member of some one of the cooperative
organisations denmark the socialist movement of denmark is closely affiliated
with the unions which include 75 per cent of the
working class including rural laborers a powerful coopera tive movement
among the farmers is also con nected with the socialist
movement and has made danish agriculture a model of organi
zation the movement here has shown a steady growth and
in 1913 the socialists polled more votes than any other
political irty and 30 per cent of all votes cast
the king asked the social democrats to form a govemmenl
thnr refused to do this but agreed to support a
rad ical government if pledged to a series of re
forms for which the socialists had been fight ing these
reforms included universal suffrage for all men and women over
25 jcars of ag direct election of members of parliament
1 popular vote and the removal of all rijt of
appointment to office from the king this agreement was made
and the radicals formed a government but upon the outbrealc
of the ynx ig v google ibs an effort was
made to postpone these t the strong socialist representation refused
i compromise and on 5 june 1915 the suffrage law
demanded went into effect and the other measures were taken
up for consideration the vote of the party from the
beginning has been as follows issi iij the socialist strength
in the government was impaired at the general elections of
april 1918 at which but 39 socialists were returned members
of the folketing finland the finnish socialist party was established
in 1899 and in 1916 became the first socialist irty
to gain an absolute majority of any legislative body by
electing 103 out of the 200 members of the finnish
diet owii to the activity of the socialists finland was
the first european country to grant absolute political equality to
women and 24 of the socialist members of the diet
are women the vote has increased steadily from 100000 in
1904 to 286792 in 1916 the socialists have organized a
powerful cooperative movement with its social centres in each village
so thai today there are more socialist clubhouses than churches
in finland in 1917 finland was declared an independent republic
civil war broke out in 1918 between the red bol
shevik guards and the white guards the latter favored the
germans who landed troops for their assistance a radical socialist
red government was set up at viborr in april 1918
and a white guard government at vasa after a turmoil
of several months a peaceful revolution was effected in december
and the moderate socialists secured control of the government holund
the social demokratischc ar beiderspartij of holland was organized in
1894 a conflict with the anarchists led by damela nieuwenhuis
formerly a socialist led to their expulsion from the old
socialisten bond which they at one time controlled the bond
then merged with the regular socialist party and the daily
paper recht voor alltn founded by nieuwenhuis became a socialist
organ the parly grew steadily and in june 1913 cast
144000 votes and secured 19 seats in parlia ment the
socialists then held the balance of power and were invited
to join in the forma tion of a ministry but
refused many import ant municipal positions are also held by
social ists in the closing months of 1918 the social
ist leader in parliament peter j troelsta critidied the queen
and incited to revolution riots and demonstrations were of frequent
oc currence due to the hi prices of foodstuffs and
the general dissatisfaction with the pro nounced german leanings of
the queen and her entourage italy during the years when
the socialist movements of most of the other nations of
europe were gaining their first foothold the italian workers were
still under the inlluence of the bourgeois liberalism of maxzini
or of theconspiratory anarchism of bakounin the present socialist party
was founded at milan m 1892 and its organization perfected
at genoa in 1892 it received 27000 votes in the
elec tion of 1893 this was followed by a period
of oppression under crispi during which thou sands of socialist
voters were disfranchised by a socalled revision of the electoral
lists the crispi ministry was wrecked on the abyssinian expedition
and his successor rudini somewhat relaxed the persecution in 1900
owing to fu sion with a radical party 175000 votes
were cast for socialist candidates this was the beginning of
an internal struggle that ended in 1912 in the expulsion
of four of the reform 4fing who were members of
the chamber of deputies one of these bissolati was che
most noted orator of the party and at the outbreak
of the war entered the cabinet the immediate resuh of
the split and an extension of the rit of suffrage
was a most rapid growth of the party at the
election of 1913 the radical wing cast 960000 votes and
elected 59 deputies the reform wing cast 200000 and elected
21 deputies the radical wing stood solid against participation in
the war the reform wing favored intervention and supported the
war a peculiar phase of the italian movement is its
great strength in agricultural sections where it has established powerful
co operative assogt ciations that directly operate the farms see
italy italian sociahsm norway the social democratic party was founded
in 1887 secured 732 votes in 1894 when it first
participated in the elections and steadily increased that vote until
it readiea 196000 in 1915 when 20 socialists were elected
to the storthing the party took a decided stand against
any form of militarism at its congress in 1915 declaring
for disarmament neutrality and obligatory arbitration the party has great
power in many municipalities a powerful womens and young peoples
move ment and is closely affiliated with the unions and
cooperatives russia because the socialist movement save for a very
brief period was compelled to organize and conduct its campaign
in secret and because of the autocratic character of the
government it is difficult to give specific facts concerning it
three parties are accorded repre sentation by the international socialist
con gress the social revolutionary party the so cial democratic
party and the group of toil the latter is a
psant party based upon the primitive communism which still prevails
in russian village and rural life the sod at revolutionary
party has adopted t terroristic methods which separate it from
other sodalist movements the social democratic party is the only
one which is strictly com parable with the sodalist parties
of other coun tries the only time that there was
an oppor tunity for a test of socialist strength was
in 1907 at the election of the first duma even
then there was more or less terrorism on the part
of the government bui the group of toil at this
election sent 116 members to the duma and the other
two parties combined 101 elec tion laws and the suppression
of open propa ganda reduced the legislative strength of all
these parlies to a small fraction of these num bers
it later became almost impossible for a sodalist to be
elected or even to vote yet in spite of these
laws there were 13 members of i a v google
the socialist group in the fourth duma which was in
session when the war broke oul all of these refused
to vote for the war credits and opposed the war
in revenge the kovem ment sent five social democratic members
to siberia the social democrats continued to spread their marxian
doctrines despite govern ment repression and imited other wings of
the sodalists to bring about the revolution of march 1917
which put an end lo tsarism kerensky a revolutionary socialist
became minister of justice in the new government the social
democratic parly issued an appeal to the workers of all
countries to unite in putting an end to a war
begun and carried on solely for the benefit of kings
and financiers in june 1917 lenine the radical socialist attacked
the war policy ot kerenskys govemmenl on 7 nov 1917
the bolshevik revolted under lenine and seized the government the
bolshevik government at once proposed a three months armistice and
at once set about pub lishing the secret treaties made
by the tsars government with the alkes the internal policy
of the new radical socialist government was inaugurated by a
series of decrees iransfer ing property throuf many vicissitudes the
bolsheviki remained in power and admiiustered the government upon the
basis of extreme switzerland long the home of exiled revolutionists
one of the strongholds of the international several of whose
congresses were held in geneva it was not until 18sb
that a social democrate party was founded in switzerland to
be sure the griitlj vetin had existed as a political
workingclass organixatton of a democraticradical character since 183a in 1901
it joined with the social democratic partj retaining its autonomy
the vote in 1911 was 120000 this was increased somewhat
in 1914 when 18 socialists were elected to the national
council the extensive unemployment due to the war caused a
slight falling off in membership in 191s16 ilie party maintained
its pacifist position through out the war and worked constantly
to secure similar action by other parties spain at a
congress held in barcelona june 1870 it was claimed that
40000 members of the mnlemalional from spain were repre sented
owing to the disruptive influence of bakounin this movement almost
completely dis appeared the present socialist party was founded in
1879 but was not strong enough to hold a congress
until 1888 in 1891 it received 5000 votes this vote
was regularly increased until in 1910 when a coalition was
made with the liberals 41000 votes were polled and pablo
iglesias long the most prominent member of the party was
elected to the cortes he was reelected in 1912 when
a further slight increase in the vote was secured sweden
the propaganda ot socialism was introduced into sweden in 1881
by august palm in 1889 at the first trade union
con vention held in sweden the program of the german
social democrats was adopted and the unions have ever since
formed the back bone of the socialist movement the party
grew steadily in membership until 1909 when as the result
of the defeat m a general strike it feu off
from 112693 to 6013 hie growth lish 190 then began
again and continued until 1915 when it was about 90000
there have been sharp divisions in the party in recent
years the more radical section wished to conduct an active
campaign for a republic which the con servatives opposed this
division climaxed in a split over the attitude of the
parly on the war whether this split will continue after
the war cannot now be foretold an election in 1915
resulted in 265000 votes for the socialists and the election
of 87 members of parliament this makes the socialist party
the strongest with 86 conservatives and 45 liberals in opposition
a powerful young socialist ent which works with me radical
wing of die features of the swedish move australia the
australian labor move ment has been characterized as socialism with
out phrases and while many socialists would dispute the characierizalion
it has a large ele ment of truth the labor
party which has a majority in boih houses of the
federal parlia md in t of leg assemblies and strot
representation in all the others does not declare for the
socialization of industry indeed it specifically announces that it does
not stand for the socialization of certain industries such as
the retail trade yet is has gone much further toward
the state ownership of industry than any other party and
during the war went to great lengtns in the nationalization
of certain branches of the retail trade the total vote
of the labor party is estimated at about 2000000 there
is a small orthodox socialist party in every state which
keeps up a sharp criticism of the com firomising character
of the labor party the alter is a direct creation
of the union move ment and is controlled more by
the union con g esses than by any machinery of
its own uring the war the party divided on the
ques tion of conscription which was endorsed by many of
the leaders including premier hughes but which was defeated by
a referendum since most of the opponents of the labor
party conscriptionists this would indicate that drawn from the fact
that the radical more orthodox socialist wing fought conscription successfully
china the socialist movement in chma which had existed in
a rather indefinite way for several years sprung into sudden
prominence when its leader sun yat sen was elected as
the first president of the shortlived republic the parliament of
which also contained 30 socialists at this time the party
had a power ful press a wide spread organization and
a program based upon that of international socialism modified to
meet chinese condiuons but the movement was manifestly exotic de
pendent largely upon foreign educated students and went down when
the rebellion was crushed by yuan shi kai it is
difficult to telt how much of the movement remains but
there is certainly a strong organization working for directly affiliated
with the international move ment has existed since 1899 the
government has pursued socialists with a brutal persecution whicn culminated
in the hanging of 12 in i9jd glc 000 sociatlsh
aod the imprisonment of a large number of others as
was natural persecution drove anar chists and socialists together and
led lo recipro cal violence in spite of the persecution
many of the foremost scholars of japan have idenii fied
themselves with the socialist movement and it maintains a press
of considerable im portance in which socialism is taught indi
rectly through discussion of current questions there are also strong
socialist movements in bulglria serbia rumania greece hun gary poland

statm the industrial condition of comparatively recent years the presence
of an evermoving frontier led to a social stratifica tion
b geographic stes which was constantly changing and which therefore
prevented the appearance of any such continuous class simple as
a socialist philosophy presupposes the pres ence of free land
and the expanding market meant a large opportunity for individual
ad vancement both from the ranks of laborers to capitalist
and from small capitalist to lar cap itahst the socialist
movement is peculiarly a product of the industrial proletariat and
while the population of the united states remained larxely rural
such a moyement could gain no great strength again the
existence of chattel slavery throughout the south prior lo ihe
civil was created an aonomic contest between these two forms
of industrial organization which overshadowed the still somewhat indistinct con
trast between laborers and capitalists but though these industrial conditions
prevented the growth of socialism in the eastern sections they
gave the greatest encouragement to the growth of a utopian
socialism and so it cane about that for many years
the united states was the experimental ground on which were
tested the various theories of european utopians these movements are
often confounded with latterday socialism they really had practically no
connection save that both have the idea of collective production
bui he collective produc tion of he colony is to
be a scheme worked out in our present society while
ihe collective pro duction of modem socialism is simply one
phase of the coming social stage william weilling came lo
america in 1849 and succeeded in or ranizing something of
a socialist movement in new york in the years immediately
following his movement however was of short duration as was
also that of joseph weydemeyer who came shonly after him
and who was a personal friend of marx and engcls
the gvil war wiped out nearly all traces of both
of these movements after ihe war the influence of the
intemational extended to america this in fluence was first seen
in the national labor union in which william h sylvis
was the most prominent worker and which practically disap peared
with his death in 1869 during the next three years
numerous sections of the interna tional were organized throughout the
country and on the removal of the international to this
country some attempt was made to revive it but its
last convention was held in phila delphia 15 july 1b76
and this convention for mally dissolved the organiiaiiou on 4
july 1874 the social democratic workingmens party of north america
was organized with a rather indefinite socialist platform this grew
in strength during the next few years and in 1877
the name was changed to the socialist labor barty of
north america following the extensive labor troubles of 1876 and
1877 this par grew into naticoial prominence and suc ceeded
in electing minor ofhcials in several states but it was
still too indefinite to pro tect itself from anarchistic influences
wnidt crept in and which nearly wrecked the par until
finally those influences reached their ch max and their end
in the haymarkei incident in chicago the work of organization
had now to be practically all done over again in
september 1887 the sixth national convention of the socialist labor
party held at buitalo n y took ud the work
of reorganization the socialist elements in the labor movement were
still rent with internal feuds but by 1889 a steady
upward growth began to be seen meanwhile certain other movements
which have undoubtedly contributed to the strength of socialism had
developed the greenback party and the henry george movement both
contained many of the ideas of socialism and undoubtedly proved
a means by which many were led to adopt the
socialist position id 1892 the socialists for the first time
nominated a presidential ticket consisting of simon wing of boston
mass and charles h matchett oi brooklyn n y in
1899 the socialist labor party split google socialist past y

between the party arid the unions the largest fraction united
with the social demo cratic party that had sprung up
around eugene v debs as a result of the american
railway union strike in 1894 this union took place at

the see sooal isu societies criminal to find the origin
of the idea that has given the world its criminal
associations it would be necessary to conduct the search into
the realm of fables for if there has been a
time when bands of outlaws have not levied tribute upon
poorly protected property history is silent upon that point modern
brains only have comprehended the full possibilities of the cooperative
idea as applied to the commis sion of crime but
the earliest applications of the theory however crude were probably
quite effective when in the 11th century assan google 809
socibtibs criminal bensabbah the old man of the moudtaias securely
protected in his rocky fortress in spired and directed the
horrible crimes of bis great band of devoted hashidrunken fol
lowers he taught the world a new truth and presented
it with a new word neither of which have been
forgotten the truth was the first clear demonstration of the
fact that when asso ciated ciitnc is well organized and
carefully directed ordinary methods of protection are powerless to cope
with it the word was assassin the title derived from
his own name which he bestowed upon his hand from
that time the criminal association has been too serious a
matter to be the inspiration of either song or story
any atternpt lo tell the story of the modern cnminat
society bens widi the camorra and the mafia the two
most powerful organizations of the kind the world has ever
known born and nurtured in italy at the dawn of
the 19th century they grew and waxed strong until the
onetime clubs of petty crimi nals had become the gigantic
octopus which overawed the entire country and threatened to cause
the downfall uihe government which had so carelessly permit teifslch
development of a lawless course efforts harvcen made of late
to cast the shadow of uncerfai upon the primary purpose
of these socieliestil has been suggested that they were orginally1tl
nizations of patriots who had banded together to protest against
existing tyrannies a careful study of the history of the
time however and a close examination of the earliest works
of the associations will prove the fallacy of such a
theory instead of having a noble past to look upon
these organ iiations have always been bands of tne most
heartless criminals a con stant menace to any government and
to all laws for some time before the camorras time
italy had been writhing in aony beneath the beefs of
the most corrupt and incompetent body of officials who ever
attempted to rule a nation the one object of the
government was to ex tract as much money as possible
from the peo ple and to give absolutely nothing in
return taxes which were hi were collected relent lessly but
little of the money obtained wcs ex pended for the
benefit of those who had been taxed governmental works were
at a stand still government officials were unpaid and the
immense sums of money which had been ex torted from
the people were wasted upon royal favdrites little by little
the corruption in high places permeated the whole fabric of
society justice became a thing unknown if suit was brought
the richest man won for there was not a judge
in the land who was not willing to sell his
decision to the highest bidder acting upon the same principle
the police became the partners of the criminal as personal
wrong and of fenses against the laws were never punished
crime became rampant the poor robbed bv the rich proceeded
to recover from their op pressors by force that which
had been taken from them by process of law and
life became a thing of little value then came the
french with their peculiar form of oppressions which culminated in
the theory that a man in prison was a more
tracta ble subject than a man at large in pursuance
of this idea thousands of arrests were made and the
men unconvicted were left behind the bars in a week
the poor penal accommodations of the country were taxed to
the last limit but as the work had only just
commenced castles were seized and turned into prisons having arrested
their men however the french dis missed them from mind
we will watch them the local authorities had too much
trouble to raise the indemnities demanded by the con querors
to think of bothering themselves about men who were securely
locked behind iron bars prisoners who were not blessed with
independ ent means had no other option than to starve
as the natural result the strong commenced to prey upon
the weak and anyone who had money was robbed without
merry among the prison ers there was one in whose
brain lodged the seed of socialism this man was antonio
giaperehi and to him belongs the somewhat doubtful honor of
having organized the first society of the camorra he had
noticed that while new prisoners were always robbed im mediately
upon their arrival few of the inmates of the prison
profited by these robberies and he suggested a plan providing
for the systematic fleecing of all newcomers the plunder to
be shared equally among all the prisoners the suggestion met
with the approval of the ma jority and the scheme
worked so well that it 4as not long before the
plan was adopted in evpfxprison in italy for a time
the organiia tion okjhe camorra was thus confined within prison
wiius but as the members were released it was suggested
that a plan that had worked so well under circumstances
in which the oppor tunities for plunder were so meagre
might ad vantageously be extended up lo the year 1828
the word camorra hd no meaning except to those who
had made the acquaintance of the society in some prison
but during tliat year the name was written in letters
of blood that made alt italy tremble one day i
merchant in the city of naples was visited bv a
stranger who asked him to contribute to thevsupport of the
camorra not knowing the nlan and never having heard of
such an argization he naturally refused the visitor insisted and
the merdiant was finally compelled toi eject him from the
shop other stores were visited with a like result and
the strange collecwr dip peared as be had come unknown
to ul le next day naples had its sensation when
the wife of the first merchant had attempted lo waken
her husband she had found him dead in bed and
the stiletto that pierced his heatt held to his breast
a placard on which it was ftated that his death
was the result of his refute to assist in the
support of the camorra a dky or two passed just
time enough to allow the ttory to become generally known
and then ancther stranger appeared upon the streets of the
city store after store was visited and the same re
quest was made but this time the words for the
caimorra carried such frightful import that many merchants submitted to
the black mail some refused however and the next morning
the murder of another business man warned the people of
the uselessness of their attempt to withstand the demands of
the order from that day the power of the camorra
be came practically absolute from do to oo its work
was extended until its was beard google socibtibs criminal with
dread in every part of italy at rcgul intervals each
storelkeper received a visit frc the strange collector and as
death was the pen alty of refusal the money demanded
was ubually paid without protest no one was exempt wherever
goods were sold or trade of any kind was carried
on the importunate collector stood ready to receive his share
of the profits he was permitted to ko everywhere he
was at the custom house where he collected his tolls
as consdentiously as if he bad been a govern ment
agenl if money was deposited he stood by the side
of the depositor in the banldng house nothing escaped him
and when the business day dosed he paid his visits
to the wine shops the ming bouses and all dens
of vice for tie officials of the society were not
partic ular as to the methods used in the malcinb
of money so long as they received their share of
the spoils in this manner was the coimtry terrorized by
the operations of a society which had be come more
powerful than the government several halfhearted attempts were made to
suppress it but as its membership was com posed of
persons from every walk of life the uackmail continued and
at last became open highway robbery then it was that
the streets of the cities became unsafe either bv day
or night and the finding of a dead body on
the public highway was of such frequent occurrence as to
occasion but little comment the victim had simply refused to
pay his tribute to the camorra it was not until
1877 uierefore that any progress was made in the restoration
of order then united italy took the matter in hand
and as this crusade was conducted by honest men who
were ready to act with energy and deter mination hundreds
of the agents of the associa tion were soon arrested
and as executions and long imprisonments followed penalties to which
the hiest as well as the lowest were sub jected
it was not long before the dreaded camorra ceased to
be dreaded while never as powerful an influence for evil
as the camorra the mafia was organized upon similar lines
and the fact that it is more recent makes it
of greater interest like the parent society its purpose was
one of murder robbery and blackmail like the parent society
it beuune stronger than the government in its own country
and as in the case of the camorra was only
subdued by the exertion of the au thorities of the
united italy there were two factors that played an im
portant part in the organization of the mafia the first
was the presence of numerous bands of outlaws organized as
a protest against the nonresident land ownership which had caused
so much poverty and misery in that part of the
country there can be no doubt but that these conditions
were about as hopeless as present day imagination can picture
the sicilian peas ants had suffered imtold miseries at the
hands of the heartless agents of the alien landlord and
the ignorance and natural viciousness of the people could suggest
but one way out of the difficulty assassination and robbery
was the remedy the other factor was the presence of
thousands of bravos soldiers and courtiers who had lost their
occupation when ferdinand granted the demand for a iiberal form
of gov 903 the abolition of the petty courts of
which there had been so many in the two sici
lies threw these men out of employment and aamp they
cared neither to work nor starve they naturally thought of
brigandage as the one way out of die dimculty with
tnat idea in view scores of military dubs were formed
and these were thedoaks behind which the members com mitted
their murders and robberies it was at question how much
of the criminal will never be known we only know
that it was his con structive genius that welded the
two factors to gether and that it was to him
that we owe the existence of the mafia strange as
it aty seem the name mafia is meaningless and the
word does not appear in any dictionary of the italian
lanage in fact up to the year 1859 the word
itself had not been coined it was only when mazzini
had gone from club to club and from outlaw band
to outlaw band forming branchesof bis secret sodety that such
a title was conceived mazzini called his united dubs oblonica
a name which was derived from two latin words obelus

which the sodeh was to do such deadly deeds to
say that mazzitu was thoroughly in sympathy with the horrible
work to which the sodety later devoted itself is to
go a step beyond the historical but its purposes as
expressed in the words mazzini autorizza furti incindi avvd enamanti
meaning mazzini authorizes thefts arson poisonings gave to the association
of criminals its name the initial letters of the five
words being used to form the new word mafia the
extent to which the mafia had expanded was shown in
1876 when the government was called upon to investigate the
abduction of an englishman named rose the sum of 20000
was demanded and paid for his release and the investigation
which followed was so revolt ing in its details that
the result was suppressed by the authorities it had been
shown that the money had been divided among many people
of various conditions from the peasantry to the commander of
the post whose gendarmes were supposed to be pursuing the
bandits the chief of police and detectives of the district
and even the judges of the courts th having promised
immunitv in case the abductors should be cap tured when
the government of iialv was noti fied of these facts
it took the matter in hand the corrupt soldiers and
officials were sent to another part of the country being
replaced by sturdy and honest regiments from the borders of
the tyrol and the mountains of switzerland the new men
had no sympathy with crime no friendship for the criminal
they knew that it was their sole duty to carry
out the orders of thdr superior officers and they performed
this duty with a vigor with which even the powerful
mafia could not cope whenever or wherever a man was
tound who could not give a per fectly clear account
of himself or prove that he had no connection with
the murderous society he was shot on the spot it
has been estimated that no less than 5000 persons met
thdr death at this time and while the search must
have resulted in the killing of many inno iit zed
v google societies criminal cent people the object of the
crusade was ac complished and the msfia after its years
of prosperity was driven into obscurity during this campaign of
extermination however hun dreds of the members of the mafia
made their escape and many or them came to this
country rumors to this effect were common at times but
ihct were not treated seriously until 1890 when the hand
of the society was felt in the killing of chief
of police david c hennesscv of new orleans for several
years there had existed two rival stevedoring firms in new
orleans the pro venzanos and the matrangos which were in
competition for the business of discharng and loading the vessels
engaged in the central american trade the provenzanos controlled this
business for some time but their services proving unsatisfactory for
some reason the work was transferred to the rival firm
then the trouble began the provenzanos contended that their services
had been dispensed with be cause the shipowners were held
in terror by the matrangos who had threatened them with
the mafia te matrangos however denied the imputation and made
counter charges in which the mafia played an important part
in accordance with his duty the chief of police pro
ceeded to look into the matter absolutely honest and utterly
fearless david hennessey realized that his discoveries would cost him
his life if the society he had unearthed should ever
be able to reach him they may get me he
said to a friend but if ihey do they will
get me in the back a prophecy which was realized
on the night of 16 oct 1890 when he was
shot to death on cirod street the assassins had been
concealed in doorways and after he had passed had stepped
out from their hiding place to rain upon him a
perfect fusillade of bullets he had threatened to exterminate the
mafia and the mafia had replied by removing him the
finale to the story is a unique page in american
history arrests were made but conviction seemed impossible and at
last the fgteople of the city determined to take the
matter mto their own hands that there ere stiletto societies
an new orleans was no longer a mat ter of
dotibt they existed and they threat ened the security of
the city their members had killed the chief of police
and they had threatened to kill others including mayor shakespeare
who had been bold enough to say we owi wemimtte
the blow that followed was one from which the maiia
in this country never recovered it was not used to
that treatment and since the new orleans lynchings it has
not raised its head police reports have indicated however that
it still exists in private and there are occauonal crimes
that may be traced to its door but this darkcellar
existence has httle about it to inspire dread even in
the heart of the roost timid another italian crim inal
society appeared in turin in 1868 organ ized for the
systematic commission of large criminal affairs it made a specialty
of saferob bing but tuidertook any promimng robbery and did
not hetate at murder at one time they had 200
members when the public became aroused to extirpate them few
could be lo cated and ii was believed that most
of them escaped to the united stales from 1905 to
1909 black hand associations were active in the united states
and led to the assassination in palermo 13 march 1909
of joseph petrosino a new york detective who had shown
especial skill in tracking the criminals from time to time
organizations more or less criminal in purpose have come into
exist ence in ihe united states and it argues well
for the character of the people that thdr life has
invariably been ofbrief duration as itmig as the kuklux klan
maintained its original purpose it was unmolested but when its

a countless number of attempted assassinations to its credit molbe

in the minds of the civilized races of the world
for absolute corruption for unalloyed crime no criminal organization yet
known to history can compare lo those of china and
some of these associations still flourish to a certain extent
in every large city ill this country under the name
of highbmders one of the most powerful is the sam
hop known here as the chee kung tong the history
of the sam hop tong can be traced back more
than 250 years according lo tra dition it has existed
since the establishment of the chinese nation its organization is
said to have been due to divine revelation and it
is known that in its early days its character was
enirely patriotic it has always been 9 power in the
celestial world it helped to over throw the tartar dynasty
it was the cause of the taiping rebellion and of
the more recent ko lo revolution many of the most
frififnl outrages against the missionaries can also be traced to
the sam hops during the two or three centuries of
its existence however the character of the association has changed
from a patriotic organi ration whose only ob ject was
to protest against the outrages of a foreign dynasty the
society has become an association of men banded together solely
for purposes of murder robbery and budiraail on arriving in
this country me sun hops or google socibtie criminal not
gitdzed under the name of chinese masons and it was
not until 1891 that the police acci dentally discovered that
the apparently inno cent title was a shield to disguise
a criminal association by this time however the chinese quarter
of san francisco had become a holbed of crime and
highbinder outrages were of fre quent occurrence in eveiy large
city in the country victims of the sam hops unwilling
to apply for police protection organized rival tongs at first
the murders had been com mitted only by ones or
twos but finally pitched battles were held on the streets
on which occa sions scores of lives were taken these
mtir ders however were not the only bad feature of
highbinder domination when the members were not killing each other
they were levying blackmail upon merchants and wealthy chinese compelling
them to pay exorbitant prices for the privilege of being
unmolested they also pursued highway robbery with perfect fearless ness
and assumed entire control of the traffic in slave girls
in san francisco where they were tnost bold the police
often declared war against them but with little success until
about 1898 when the chinese business men took the matter
in hand and at their request the clii nese officials
in this country appealed to the home govemnient for assistance
then a cru sade in earnest was undertaken the meeting
places of the various tongs were found and broken open
record books and other jlocumeni ary evidence was seized and
hundreds of ar rests were made as the punishment which
followed these arrests was applied in the chi nese custom
extending to the relatives of the offenders those who were
still in china being killed and twrtured il was not
long before the criminal organizations were driven itno com parative
obscuriti the most noxious criminal organizations in the united states
have existed m the larger cities where they have resorted
to a higher class of frauds and robberies those that
have de voted themselves to the open country on the
other hand have been made up of men of a
lower criminal stamp like our own gangs of outlaws and
have been guilty of murder and robbery with violence usually
these bands have been composed of young men under the
leadership of the most determined man in the company as
in the case of the younger and james gangs but
there have been instances in which even women have been
the leaders of such associations of lawbreakers louise bou viers
headed a society of 40 men and the leader of
one of the most heartless companies of in dian dacoits
was a woman while such bands of criminals have usually
been recruited from the lower walks of life instances are
not want ing in which men of education and social
posi tion have resorted to this method of gaining a
livelihood one society of thieves which ter rorized mayence in
germany for several years was led by an expriest while
the habits noirs or evening dress gane of paris was
composed of persons of excellent social stand ing who had
met with financial reerses in 1837 the authorities of rome
discovered and broke up an organized criminal socierty many of
the members of which were connected with the noble families
of italy among those ar rested were count dionisi de
traja and the countess angellucci de traja as well as
sev eral members of the popes bodgtu3itd all of whom
had been long esteemed as persons of afl exemplary character
france has often been at the mercy of such criminal
societies and there is reason to believe that crime clubs
exist at the in 1849 the thiberts were disbanded after
they had been successful in pursuing all kinds of criminal
operations this association which numbered more than 800 members was
com posed of every variety of criminal alf working in
perfect harmony under one director what one branch could not
do another accomplished and there was no phase of crime
which could not be undertaken the disbandment of the thiberts
however was the signal for the or ganization of other
associations along similar fines and many of these societies were
made up of seemingly harmless folk men and women who
lived in apparent respectability or mem bers of the same
family who pursued their careers of crime tmder the direction
of one of their number such a man was hippolyte
vil let the leader of the lamaire band whose crimes
remained unchecked from 1852 to 1855 when the criminals were
exposed and com pelled to pay the penalty of their
murders and robberies on the gallows an instance of organized
criminal effort was exposed by the police in paris in
1888 this association known as the catussemeumanl was one of
the ffreatest of modem bands of criminals for while it
was imder the direction of two men located in paris
its lines extended into every part of europe everywhere it
had its agents bands of pickpockets norse stealers housebreakers confidence
men and swindlers of every character in addition to this
it operated a banking house in london through which it
was a simple matter to negotiate its stolen stocks and
bonds or to dispose of its silver and gold with
such facilities the operations of the society were naturally enormous
and were only exposed at last through the clever work
of the french detectives assisted by officers from scotland yard
the real leader of the catusse menegant was a man
named chambon who under the name of victor chevalier lived
with his wife in the rue poteau to all appir
ances his sole business was that of conducting a livery
stable his arrest and that of his lieutenants was soon
followed by confessions which enabled the police to arrest many
other members of the association they were found in alt
parts of europe and in almost every grade of society
but the evidence against them was so complete that nearly
all were convicted and sentenced to more or less lengthy
terms of imprisonment the system in new york may he
looked upon as the last modern criminal association in america
it was an alliance between certain ngs and gang leaders
with corrupt poli ticians and corrupt members of the police
force it met its death through the ef forts of
charles s whitman then district at torney of new york
who convicted lieutenant becker a high police official with the
murder of a gambler who disobeyed orders becker and his
agents were electrocuted whitman was rewarded by being made governor

ixiii definition sociolo is primarilv one of the many techniques
which make up tne equip ment of social science as
a whole in the sec ond place each of these
techniques is a growing body of knowledge arrand and interpreted
ac cording to the respective special standards and each in
turn is a more or less explicit body of conclusions
about the bearing of the respective findings upon contemporary problems
both of d google sociology interpretation and of control chief
among the other techniques for scientific dealing with flocial relations
are psycholotrv anthropology ethnology comparative philology history political economy political
science and statistics the task of social science in gen
eral or the cooperation of these techniiues is to make
human phenomena intellieible and eventually as far as possible controllable
this task involves determmation of the norm or norms according
to which control should be exercised the sociological technique is
thai variant amona the social science techniques which proceeds from
the perception that after altotving for their purely physical relations
all human phenomena are functions not only of persons but
of tetsons vihose personality on the one hand expresses itself
in part through the formation of groups and on the
other hand is in part produced through the influence of
groups in brief sociology is that technique which approaches knowledge
of humm experi ence as a whole through investigation of
group aspects of the phenomena in order to understand the
place of sociolo in the whole apparatus of knowledge it
is necessary to become familiar with the fact that the
growth of the social sciences since 1800 has been essentially
the evolution of a simple scientific method a method which
while he coming more specialized and diversified on the one
hand is becoming both more unified and more comprehensive on
the other at the same time it is assembling a
more and more coherent body of knowledge stid interpretation the
outcome has been not thai the different divisions of social
science are more isolated from one another than in 1800
but that the best work in each is certain to
show effects of contact with all this is not the
traditional view until n era of the development of many
independent sciences of human life it is not an excursus
from our subject therefore but a necessary introduction to the
most mature views of the subject to dwell at some
length upon our radi cal proposition hibtory the problem of
knowledge in the field of sodal science reduces to this
ivhat is the meaning of human experience and to what
extent have we developed a technique which may he relied
upon to ascertain more of that meaning to explain the
origins of sociology we must answer the question what has
social science in general done toward working out a reliable
method of interpreting human experi ence consult small the meaning
of social science if this question were answered in full
it would include an account of the evolu tion of
philosophy and psychology since locke in enland since descartes in
france since wolff m germany we may merely summarise to
the effect that modem philosophy and psychol ogy have found
common ground with alt posi tive science in the commonplace
that all con vincing interpretation of experience must be generalization
of experiences to this com monplace we may add the
proposition which is not equally trile which experience is nevcrthe
less steadily enforcing viz that valid social science cannot be
many it mut be one sociology made its appearance as
an ameri can pursuit in 18s3 for several decades ameri
can sociologists consecrated far more ingenuity and passion to propaganda
of the conception thai sociology is was and ever shall
be an in dependent science than to search into its
actual ongins and to analysis of its necessary inter relations
in this the earlier sociolosts ex hibited their intellectual consanguinity
with most of their scholastic predecessors and con temporaries like
so many other zealots tor the advancement of knowledge they
proclaimed themselves the high priests of an independent cult to
which independent cult however as ihey often declared in the
same breath all other scientific cults must one day become
subordinate even now this earlier misconcep tion survives among social
scientists sociologists not excepted in order therefore to indicate the
historical relations between so much of our technique as we
have thus far developed dnd the other techniques for investigating
human experience we must present sociology as it evolved with
aiid out of the totality of 19th century social science
until now the thoughts of the vast majority of men
about human experience past or present have been mostly nebulous
mystical irresponsible people in general even including those who passed
as scholars have been con tent to accltt versions of
human experience without inquiring closely into the credibility or he
sufficiency of the evidence in support of the versions or
into the conclusiveness of the inferences drawn from the evidence
on or about 1800 a movement began to be manifest
among european scholars which like most movements that later prove
to be momentous igtrobably did not at once disclose a
large frac tion of lis significance to many of its
promoters the date 1800 is selected for symbolic conveni mice
it is at the centre of events which fall within
a zone occupying 25 years on either side from the
present outlook the meaning of the movement is more evident
than it could have been to the men whose gradual
comingto consdousness was the making of the movement we embrace
its entire sweep in ail dimensions from 1800 until now
in the formula was a drive toward objectivity for the
purposes ot this sketch we may define the term objectivity
as reqtusition that nothing shall be allowed to pass as
knowledge until in every conceivable respect it literall reflects reality
previous to 1800 except within relatively immediate ranges of experience
that which passed as social science under whatever name as
a rule pitiably failed to satisfy this standard before one
third of the 19th century had passed european scholars in
each of the then conventional di visions of social science
had betrayed prophetic discontent with the existing state of koowtedge
in their fields and with the current methods of search
for more knowledge they had begun to make out ways
and means of making knowl edge within their respective fields
both more ample and more accurate in the lifht of
our experience meanwhile we are accredited by the facts when
we say that this discontent and this resolve presently amounted
to a concerted drive toward objectivrty in social science historians
economists professors of jurisprudence were not discontented with precisely the
same things in their respective divisions of labor nor with
d google sociology 900 precisely the same things which were
regrelled in one anothers fields they did not propose identical
means of removing the obslriictions of which they were severally
conscious we may anticipate the most obvious conclusions which our
survey will impress however by pointing out that in effect
if not in professed program the detached provincial uncoor dinated
uncorrelated scnolarship in the social science of the year 1800
has become the com paratively organic scholarship of to day
bv organic m this connection we mean reciprocally reinforcing there
were countermarches here and there during the 19th century toward
such specialism and isolation in research as would have threatened
to reverse tie movement toward objectivity these countermarches were not
simultaneous in all countries nor in all sciences and they
did not long continue their drift toward earlier sterility on
ihe contrary in spite of all the caste spirit among
scholars social science in its various divisions has become more
and more interpenetrating since 1800 there has been on the
whole an accelerated process of reciprocal assimilation of ideas between
all the different departments of knowledge within the range of
social science not to speak of reciprocal modifications be tween
physical and social science priori of mention as promoters of
the drive toward objectivity belongs to the his torians while
consciousness of the past as having been and as having
had some sort of meaning for the present had been
a factor time out of mind in the thinking of
both learned and unlearned that which was accepted as history
previous to 1800 was often more imaginative than authentic soon
after 1800 the work of devising means of discriminating between
false and true between adequate and inadequate evidence and so
between trustworthy and un trustworthy reconstructions of the past was
in full swing the technique by which the his torians
began to discredit previous credulity soon became known as critical
methods or as historical criticism in his account of a

the one hand that modern sociology is inconceivable in the
absence of certain additional ideas to which the early 1
9th century historians gave currency and on the other hand
that the failure of these historians to make the most
intensive use of these ideas operated as a challenge to
certain thinkers to develop the suggestions until they became tools
of tne technique called sociology thus the conception of conliniiity
in hutnan institutions savigny roman law in the middle ages
the conception of the muttiplicity of factors operating in historical
combination and sequence richhorn german dvic and legal history the

as a basis for his lorical opinion ranke ecclesiastical and
political archives principally of the ref ormation and post re
format on periods whether the sociologists have made more or
less use better or worse use of these ideas than
the historians did is aside from the present point the
sociologists took over from the historians these ioeas and others
of more particular types and employed them in distinc tive
ways as the historians developed critical methods to higher and
higher degrees of pre cision sociologists became aware that the
same methods or eoually penetrating methods must be used for
them by historians or by them selves whenever the tasks
which the soaolbgists undertook required historical research turning to another
antecedent of sociology if we trace political economy no farther
bade than the physiocrau in france or adam smith in
england it antedates these beginnings of critical history in esecl
however political economy did not become an appreciable driving force
in the thrust toward objectivity until the historians were well
in the lead at this point we are considering the
development of political economy solely with reference tp the question
what relation did political economy nave u the differentiation of
sociology the sub stantial fact in reply to that question
is that the economists were the first type of scholars
to undertake the task of carrying through a completely objective
analysis of what takes plac completely objective way from the
beppnt they tried to nevertheless in making the attempt they
not only from time to time de vised improvements in
their own methods of closing in on their aim but
they struck out suggestions of inquiry into what occurs in
other kinds of groups than the economic both directly and
indirectly th cleared rtie way for an enlargement of their
field of operations in the directions presently followed by the
sociol ogists just as the economists implicitly raised and tried
to answer the question what are the actual phenomena of
cause and effect within the whole range of economic groupings
so a little later the sociologists began to feel the
urge of the related questions what are the actual phenomena
of cause and effect through out the whole range of
human groupings in other words throughout the whole range of
human society in certain respects as far as it affects
sociology the outcome of the british move toward objectivity assgtciated
with the names of adam smith ricardo and mai thus
is more evident in the german than in the british
succession at the close of the 18th century german thinking
about economic relations had reached a dead centre german ideas
had been temporarily stabilized by cameralism a pecu liar and
highly developed bodjr of theory about every phase 01 action
within the stale consult small the cameralists this system of
ideas and of practice had been developing since 1s55 it
did not correspond in its sub divisions with later academic
definitions of the social sciences it started not as general
theory dgooglc sociology but as formulation of administrative expediency it
set for dinaling e the t to the slates problem
of central question to which cameralism elabor answers was the
ruler being allpowerful over his territories and his subjects what
policies and what details of practice in pur suance of
the policies must he adopt in order to make his
rule most secure at home and in order to provide
most abundant means of asserting hinlself against other rulers it
would require hut little reflection to prepare ainst surprise at
what happened under the circumstances of the time this question
neces sarily led to answers which amounted to pre scribe
programs covering the entire outward life of the subjects of
german rulers il soon became evident to the advisers of
those rulers and to the administrators of their states that
their problem involved not merely physical factors but that it
was a question of training the whole population for all
the different sorts of useful work of which human beings
are capable from generation to generation the men who developed
camcralistic theory and practice saw more and more clearly that
if the rulers of german states were to command abundant
resources they must rule over re sourceful people this meant
that the people must be trained physically mentally morally and
technically in the end therefore cameral istic theory covered eveiytbing
in tiie lives of the citizens from farm work to
religious wor ship the machinery for administering this theory grew
more and more complex in detail its organization differed in
one state from that in another its main purpose was
everywhere the same viz to make the people as amenable
as possible to all the discipline necessary to insure maximum
performance of all the phys ical mental and moral processes
tributary to the strength of the ruler it need not
be pointed out that this program involved dealing from this
special point of view with every sort of activity wnich
has since come under the attention of oolilical science and
political economy in their latest forms in so far as
cameralism dealt with economic questions in the later sense it
treated them as matters primarily of the state not of
individuals german economic theory iherc fore was couecttvistic in the
highest debtee only incidentally and in a wholly subordinate degree
was it individualistic it was a theory of for and
by the government this camcralistic system contained the germs of
all subsetjuent german administrative theory and suestions of much that
was later devel oped into fundamental economic doctrine its centre
of attention may be said to have occupied its original
prominence only to the time of sonnenfels l7is from that
date until the third decade of the 19th century there
was an interim of barrenness in german economic thinking this
was in spite of the fact that an occasional book
of some merit was produced for example biisch of hamburg
on the cir culation of money geldumlauf the one point
of departure from which it is possible to get a
true view of the develop ment of economic theory in
germany is that the first half century of german political
econ omy was essentially not german at all it was
english this period jails roughly within the dates 182070 during
all this time the german economists were unconsciously breaking with
all the national precedents for their particular kinds of work
and were trying to do a radically ungerman thing they
were first of all doing their best in their own
division of labor to substitute objectivity for fragmentary knowl edge
and premature conclusions but uiey were trying to do it
in an english way they v rely trying to graft
an english branch upon a german tree they were trying
to make english roots grow in german soil and hear
abundant and useful fruits than i stocks if ihey had
succeeded the english roots would have driven out german roots
german controlling economic ideas would have changed frdm collect ivistic
to individualistic this fact goes far toward resolving the con
fusion of german economic theorizing between 1820 and 1870 during
all this time the eco nomic group of german thinkers
were in dead earnest in their drive after objectivity but
the passkey to their procedure is that the prevailing spirits
among them were all he while trying to naturalize strange
gods for the theoretical and practical statecollectivism which reached its
culmmalion in the theory and practice of fred erick the
great in prussia and uaria theresa in austria they tried
to substitute the socalled theory of economic liberalism or economic
determinism whichever of these two variants of an identical underlying
conception was most prominent in specific cases it relegated the
state very largely to a passive or negative role and
it made individual initiative para mount in short the economic
theorizing which held the centre of the stage in germany
between 1820 and 1s0 was violently ungerman in its presuppositions
it was that unfortunate ex cerpt from adam smithism which
passed by way of ricardo into circulation as the science
of political economy and in german hands its implications were
worked out to a degree of refinement never surpassed and
hardly equalled in england if space permitted it would be
illuminating to cite particulars in which the classical econo mists
both in england and in germany by what amounted to
a trial and error process tested every conceivable way of
accommodat ing facts to the classical presuppositions with each variation
of the attempt they confirmed is which later transformed certain
sociologists for example list and tne enure zollverein movement about
1840 the socalled historical school roscher knies about 18s0 princesmith
and the ilan chesterists of the volkswirthschaftlicher kon eess about
1860 the austrian school cari enger bohmbawerk about 1870 the
profes sorial socialists or the ethical school schmol ler wagner
verein fiir socialpolitik about 1870 the sociological school to be
men tioned later about 1880 as each contending subhypothesis under
the leading assumptions failed to vindicate itself as the one
missing clue to the mystery of economic relations the certainty
was approaching that some one would see in these failures
the fact that economic groups are not effects of single
causes but of multiple causation thai economic d google sociology
groups do not exist in a vacunm that they are
aflecied tgty some of tha same influences which work in
olher groups some of which influences are transmitted from other
groups to i groups and are sometimes more deci economic
groups than socalled tors prcmer it was a foregone conclusion
that when these observations were made on the basis of
the experience of economists they would stimulate someone lo exiwriment
with a new apparatus of groupanalysis this prob ability was
confirmed in the case of some of the sociologists we
may indicate this factor in the evolu tion as follows
judged by subsequent events and expressed in the most summary
form fo litical economy became a forerunner of soaol ty
because however delincd and however conducted political economy devoted itself
more and more effectively to critical analys of that portion
of social phenomena which seemed lo the economists to fall
within their appropriate field of view regardless of the question
which had to be reconsidered over and over again as
to the validity of their ideas pbout their special field
and regardless too of the specific facts which they collected
and of the peculiar doctrines which the various theo rists
derived from the facts by the very refine ments of
analysis through which they attempted to get at all the
meanings of their phenomena the economists set a pace and
furnished sug gestions for imitation which could not have remained
without influence upon other men who were interested in other
species of group phenomena simply because he type of human
group which forms the market whether in the most generalized
or iti the most localized sense is only one of
myriads of types of human sroupits it was only a
question of time when lere would be imitators of the
economists who would devise ways of applying equally search ing
analysis to many types of human activities not primarily and
immediately at all events not exclusively and finally activities of
the market this then is the main aspect in which
the evolution of economic thinking since 1800 roncerns sociology in
a word it seems to have been necessary that a
type of thinkers should have been developed who had become
keen for analysis of the operations of the mar ket
and as we shall observe in the next para graph
another type keen for analysis of mens actions under the
political and legal aspects liefore a type of scholars could
develop with aljllity to perceive that men are not fully
ana lyzed when they have been thought of only under
the economic the political and the legal aspects in fact
the sociologists were recruited very generally from cither the historical
the economic or the political faculties our main thesis at
this particular stage of the exposition is that he economists
prepared the way for the sociologists and partly assured their
coming hy working out an apparatus for objective ex hibit
of economic processes as they really are in so far
as the sociologists derived immedi ately from the economists it
was by cherishing the spirit of groupanalysis and by turning
this animus to application upon other than eco nomic groups
ever before the middle of the 18th century there were
among the cameralisis yritcrs who seem lo have been almost
within sight of the jlt small the camcralists pp 1s
and 249 the most effective prospecting for a future sociology
however was done m ger many at about the middle
of the 19th centuo by a series of political scientists
these men seem to have had very hltle to do
with one another and wc do not know whether they
were actuated by impulses received from a common source several
of them at all events hit upon a similar if
not an identical problem and it was in substance the
same firoblem with which the men in germanv ampir and
and the united stales who called them selves sociologists began
their work 20 or more years later von mohl one
of the most notable of these presociologisls reviews the movement
and furnishes a bibliography of it as it had developed
up to 18fi5 gescbichte und literatur der staatswissenchaften vol i
pp 69110 von mohl is himself typical oe this movement
at its best and we may use him as the
most available index of its character the very title of
his first chapter affects an american sociologist as a generation
ahead of its time it reads the sciences of the
state and the sciences of society die suals wissenschaften und
die gesellschafiswissen schaften the contents of the chapter con firm
the impression of modernness it turns out that the author
was in the bonds of that mystical conception of the
slate from which the germans are not yet delivered and
he placed in antithesis with the state an equally mystical
concept society yet his challenge to analyie the concepts state
and society might very well be celebrated as one of
the beginnings of sociology he proceeds after this fashion i
only recently have we come to the clear con ception
that the community life of men is by no means
exhausted by life in the state but that between the
sphere of the individual per sonality and of the organized
unity of popular life there is a collection of intermediate
life phenomena which also have community objects as their purpose
which do not have their origin from the state or
through it although they are in existence in it and
that these are of the highest significance for weal and
woe these two areas of thoughts and theories which for
more than two thousand years have seemed to be similar
or at most have been regarded as pan and whole
have at length proved them selves to be essentially different
and must also be treated separately so that in the
future they will exist side by side as distinguished but
coequal divisions of human knowledge the science of society must
now be founded and developed in particular its limits with
respect lo the science of the state must be de
termined this not merely tor soci ety but almost as
much ajso for the state and the theory of the
state of independ ent works about society there is not
a word in the older schools of philosophic writing down
to the lime of kant in this entire literature there
is not a single work which has attempted to grasp
in their essential nature the life cir cles outside of
the purpose and organism of the state and to think
of them as a whole thereupon von mohl names numerous
books and monographs which began to appear after d google
1797 in germany and beginnine with uoates quieu in france
which betrayed a certain dis appoinling appearance of having seen
the need e of society in distinction from a not
social philosophers but social partisans saintsimon fourier robert owen and
after referring to numerous political theorifits who had been approaching
the real problem as he saw it of whom the
most notable was ahrens cour de droit nature 1837 and
the maturer rendering of his peculiar idea in die organische
staatslehre 1850 von mohl at some length outlines his own
conception of the needed science of society this scheme is
impossible and need not be noticed further except by way
of repetition that it was an honest groping after the
sociological problem which laler emerged because of the attention which
americans have given to treitschke as a prophet of german
worldpower more than one kind of interest attaches to the
fact that treitschkes entrance upon his academic career was mariced
by his publication in 1859 of a monograph in which
he claimed to have given its reductio ad absurdum to
von mohls argu ment for a new science of society
geseli schaftswissenschaft ein kritischer versuch treitschke discusses particularly the proposals
of ahrens and von mohl he asks whether it is
really necessary as such men contend either completely to reconstruct
political sci ence or to create a new doctrine that
shai totally displace it he reaches his reply by in
specting in turn the groups which von mohl had used
as illustrations and as to each of them he reaches
virtually the opposite conclu sion to that of von mohl
viz treatment of this group belongs in political science and
can be adequately provided by political science with le exception
however of tribal and ethnic groups certain economic strata nahr
wehrundlehr stand the educated and the uneducated religious communities voluntary
associations of all sorts and the family the groups which
he considers are so obviously political that with reference io
them the con clusion is not surprising it was easy
to show that each of the groups not primarily political
has numerous and vital relations to the state nor was
it difficult to make it appear to friends of an
established cult who did not want a rival that a
rival would be superfluous it was plausible that all the
relations of these groups to the stale could be treated
best by the estab lished science of the state and
that facts about these groups which did not interest the
science of the state were not worth scientific notice there
is a tone of assurance therefore in treitschkes manner throughout
the mono fraph which indicates his belief that he was
orever laying the bogy of a science of socie in
fact however in order to reach his negative conclusion he
had advertised the existence of groups which he named and
others which he did not name he had featured facts
about these groups which could not be exhausted by political
theory we cannot prove that treitschkes influence actually stimulated any
one to follow up the study of human groups it
is certain that he did not prevent such study and
he unconsciously contributed to demonstra tion that it was needci
while it is impossible in the present state of our
knowledge to make out precisely how the drcuit was at
last closed between all these stimuli and the minds of
the mm who actu ally won a place in social
science for a new method of investigation it is easy
to make out the period after which the sociological conti
nuity was unbroken it has been almost undis puted tradition
among the sociologists that august comte who is supposed to
have coined the word is also the founder of sociology

to discuss the question whether spencer in england or schaffie

description since we have seen how sociology got a name
and a place the question remains what sort of a
thing is this that is so named and placed the
only valid answer is still essentially historical from the time
of spencer and schafc sociology has been more a steadily
developing mode of thinking than an entity conforming to a
statical de scription this is almost equally true of the
more strictly generalizing type of sociology characterized in our original
formula and of the numerous techniques or concrete applica tion
of scientific knowledge which also use the name sociology confining
ourselves now to the former thcearly sociologists felt a woe
isme if they did not succeed in getting a vision
of human socie as a whole instead of feeling aalisfaclion
with the conventions of social science they were impressed with
the futility of everything that had been accepted so far
as scientific exposition of human ex perience comtes dictum that
the root of evil in the european world was the
anarchy of fundamental ideas might have been chosen as their
slogan they were convinced that the inly way of removing
the confusion in mens minds about social relations must be
achieva ment of a controtung conception of hu ety in
its entirety wilhour apparent hesila about the chances of convincing
the world they gave themselves to the task of framing
a rid conception that would be justified by the facts
with differences of detail they believed that hitman society the
world over past present and future makes up some sort
of a unity they believed that parts of this whole
or in cidents within the operations of this whole are
to be imderstood only as they are assigned to their
actual places and connections subordinate to the whole all the
variations which have be come parts of the main tendency
of sociological theory since 1875 have started from some form
of tlus presumption at the time when this tendency entered
upon its permanent course the most potent reconstructive factor in
all science was darwinian biology it would have been wonderful
if the attempts to visualize society in all its dimetrsions
had not come under this virile influence in fact they
were not only influenced but they were over influenced until
well into the 20th century the strength of the sociologists
was very largely applied erst to debate with one another
and with social scientists of the older types about classification
of the sciences and about claims between these older possessors
and the socio logical intruders to equities in scientific terri

and opinion are concomitant one cannot exist without the other
hence there can be no sociology without esthetology technology philology
and so phiology under the second head the schemes of

to comprehend all societary relationships as analogues of the structure
and functions of physical organisms on the whele all of
the men who approached the problem in the same way

of detail in the conception although american sociologists as a
rule have regarded the conception as more useful pedagogically than
scientifically and al thought use of bio logical analogies in
either sense has rapidly lost favor projiress of sociology toward
aca demic recognition both in europe and the united states
has been seriously embarrassed by the widely prevalent impression among
other misconceptions that sociology is merely a name for amateurish
dallying with remote and imperfect likenesses between physiological and social
relations while the sociological division in the drive toward objectivity
in social science was in danger of exhausting itself in
attempts to resolve human experience into symbolic or literal biology

went far toward es tablishing the belief that evolutionism and

first phjsicat scientiet to get a hearing for the contradictory
doctrine that evolution ascended one step in the scale with
the diiterentiation of mind and that it foreshadows the ultimate
control of physical forces by psychic forces although the further
significance of the book was not recognized at once it
virtually called for the transformation of socio loy into social
psychology while wards psychological method was impossible he heartened ameri
can sociologists to assume at once an affirmative answer to
the question which has not ceased to embarrass bricisfa sociology
as to whether evolution would permit any reckoning upon mental
influences at all in fact with all their differences of
detail from the time that a few americans began to
call themselves sociolorkts they were practically of one accord in
the belief that the distinctive and decisive trait in human
society is that it is somehow or other a play
of menial factors at the same time ward was a
conspicuous illustration of a crudity not vet entirely outgrown by
sociologists which was common to all the earlier social scientists
of the generaiiiing types each of them more or less
consciously cherished an ideal of a com plete system of
sodal science in most cases to be called bv the
name of the respective dreamers division of social science this
version projected a structure of knowledge in which there would
be a place for eveilhing of importance in human affairs

that point may be characleriwd in general as a tendency

to increase attention to functional phenomena the predominance of statical

described as a psychological sur vey chiefly generalized trom or
illustrated by groups visible in and around the austrian em

a single essay in sociolog ical methodology is the relatively
large propor tion of concrete material cited in support of
the more generalized conclusions that rat lenhofer has had so

most frequently been scheduled either in the deigtartmetit of economics
or of sociology this assigoment obviously corresponds more to academic
convenience than to intrinsic rela tionship what then is the
technique which is now the distinctive equipment of the sociologist
pri marily it is a collection of categories first of
all uiese are categories of rationalization they are subspecies in
the gradations within the genus of thought forms which resect
human relations in the large they begin with the most
general such as group socios group structure group function group
forces group process group interest etc these most general categories
pass into subordinate forms which reflect descending orders of gener
ality in observed group phenomena the scale passes from least
specific terms to most specific through categories for rough preliminary
class ification of groups the variations of these number of
principles which may be made the basts of classification thus
for certain pur poses objectivity is served by analysis of
groups strictly on the basis of quantitative classin cation simmel

objectivity is served by applying one or more of the
grada tions of categories on the basis of race industry
religion culture politics language etc it is obvious that these
less general categories need not necessarily in the first instance
oe original with the sociologists the contrary b probable they
are morelikely to be categories worked out by anthropologist ethnologist
economist etc and taken over by the sociologist whenever his
problem involves the previous work of other divisions of science
for example few men within the ranks of the sociologists
have exerted more influence upon sociological method than the anthropologist

ciety etc or the english professor of juris prudence sir
henry maine ancient law 1861 village communities 1871 early his
tory of institutions 1875 dissertations on fjirly law and custom
1885 etc these categories do not of themselves constitute sod
ology any more than the categories multi plicand quotient cube
root constitute mathematics the uses of the categories con stitute

this varies in accordance with the particular char acter of
the problem undertaken from the most abstract dealing with questions
of epistemology and methodology to the most concrete questions of
juvenile courts or milk supply the generic factor in common
from one end of uiis scale to the other is
reference of the problem to its group attachments instead of

appalling volume of insights into social relation ships which had
not been noticed by previous scholars and the search with

cial scientists never confessed it in quite this ay it
is easy to see now that all of them icluding
the sociologists who indulged at all i speculations about the
larger aims of science treated the aggresate of human events
past and present like a cojlection of structural elements and
they assumed that the task of social sci ence their
own part of it in partitnilar was to organize all
the miscellaneous events which have filled the career of manlcind
from the beginning up to the present into a schematic
combination in which each occurrence would have its appropriate place
and in which the relation of each occurrence to every
other oc currence would be evident we may frankly admit
that sodolo would not have been born when it was
and its early history would not have been what it
was if tius conception of scientific ssibility had not stimulaied
a few men to risk the attempt to realize this
conception which men before ihem in other branches of science
had dismally failed to vindicate at the same time we
must insist upon the truth that in this respect the
sociolo gisis were merely experimenlinff with a chimera which had
over and over again lured social sdenlisis of all the
older types but just as the more objective historians of
the latest half century have fortified themselves against suspicions of
identity with the socalled philosophers of history so the sociologists
of today are more or less consciously and ex plicitly
repudiating the conception just indicated which they or their immediate
predecessors un blushingly published a neration ago the totality of
human experience is too big too complicated too unexplorable to
be exhibited by tne human mind as a complete and
inclusive sstem of articulated parts with each event roughout the
length and breadth of human ex perimce visibly bearing its
actual relation to all the other events the thought of
sucb compre hension as something within the readi of human
intelligence can no longer be entertained by a responsible mind
our ideal at present is discovery of typical qualitative relationships
of antecedent and consequent of cause and effect of harmony
and disharmony of stability and instability of construct ven ess
and destructive tiess in as many different types of human
groups as possible we entertain hopes of reaching certain quantitative
expressions of the same relations but about these we are
much less sanguine this is on the purely scientific adc
antecedent to whatever we may feel au i the side
of social thorized to undertake i control or social art
we understand hat there a ferences in the feasibility of
thjg ideal depend ent for instance ugton tne remoteness or
near ness in space or time or upon the simplicity
or comiexlty of the group immediately in question we believe
that from generation to generation men may and with progressive
use of available means for accumulating knowledge of human conditions
they will become more sophisticated and competent to control their
situation in the interest of increasing develop ment of human
cajracities within recent years the advances of social science in
general and of sociology in particular have manifested increas ing

also made himself acquainted with geometry and astronomy that he
had listened to anaxagoras or archelaus is only reported by
untrustworthy authorities plato accounts for his masters acquaintance with the
works of the former by supposing that he had read
the work written by thai philosopher according to xenophon he
was familiar with the doctrines of other natural philosophers although
he did not accept ihem plato repre sents socrates as
saying that while still very young he met parmenides the
most important of the eleatic philosophers who was then ad

a material influence on his ilosophical development was exercised by
the sophists to whose discourses he occasion ally listened and
with whom he frequently entered into conversation excepting in con
nection with his philosophical career only a few circumstances of
his life are known he served as a hoplite or

10 naval crfficers were publicly arraigned for neglecting the sacred
duty of burying the slain in consequence of a violent
storm the clamor for their condenmation rose so high that
the court wished to proceed in violation of all legal
forms but socrates the presiding judge on that day refused
to put the question he soon after showed that he
could withstand tyrants as well as the populace he was
sum moned by the thirty to proceed with four other
persons to salamis to bring back leon an athenian aticen
who had retired thither to escape the cruelty and rapacity
of the new govemmenl he alone refused while the others
obeyed the order he declined taking further share in public
affairs giving as a reason the warnings of an internal
voice a divine men tor of which he was wont
to speak in the writings of the disciples of socrates
he appears almost always as a man advanced in years
such as they themselves had known him with remarkable physical
strength and endur ance he trained himself to coarse are

amiing thus to reduce the number of his wants as
a distant approach to the perfection of the gods who

relied on er6s love which without excluding its sensuous element
he refined and utiliied as an instrument in the conduct

aristophanes in his comedy of the clouds first represented in

and opinions which really belonged to him but also anaxagorcan
doctrines and sophistical tendencies in 399 bc formal accusation was

guilty of crime first for not wor shipping the gods
the city worships and for introducing new divinities of his

him by aristophanes more than 20 years earlier his accusers
were meletus a young dramatic poet little known and person
ally almost a stranr to socrates and who is said
to have joined m the accusation because he felt himself
injured by socrates demonstration of the ignorance of poets respecting
their art anytus a rich leatherdealer and influential demagogue who
was displeased with the de predatory judgment of socrates respecting
the athenian statesmen and politicians and lycon a public orator
who felt injured by what soc rates said of the
orators the trial took place before a dikastery or lawcourt
composed of citizen judges like our juries but far more
numerous the number present or this occasion has been variously
set down at 500 501 557 and 567 his bold
defense which appeared to his judges as pre sumptuous ness
is preserved by plato under the title of the apology
of soc rates he dwelt on his mission to convict
men of their ignorance for their ultimate bene fit declared
himself a public blessing to the athenians assurinjj them if
his life was spared he would continue m the same
course and re garded the approach of death with utter
indif ference to his judges his philosophical reflec tions seemed
a violation of those ethical and religious foundations of the
athenian state which the restored democracy was endeavoring to reestablish
the former intimacy of soc rates with alcibiadcs and with
the hated tyrant criiias led to a mistrust of his
doctrines and purposes yet the condemnation was voted by only
a small majority some read three and others 30 but
since after his condemnation he would not acknowledge himself guilty
by expressing an opinion as to the punishment he should
receive but declared himself worthy on the contrary of beii
fed at the pryianeum as a benefactor of the state
and at last only on the persuasion of his friends
agreed lo a fine of 30 minae he was condemned
to death by an increase of 80 wbtes the execution
had to be delayed 30 dhys until the return of
the sacred ship whia had been sent to delos on
tfie periodical theoric mission every morn ing his wife aoh
three sons together with his companions and friends assembled in
his cell and he converged with them as he had
been wont to do la his solitary hours he composed
a hymn to apfcuo and versified several of the fables
of sgtphi5 first attempts at poetical ltes bie composition his
friends formed projects for his escape and crito his old
and tried friend undertook to persuade him lo comply with
their wishes he considered it however his duty as a
citizen to obey the laws thou they were tadlv administered
and would not consent early on the morning of the
fatal day his wife and friends met in his ceil
to spend the last hours with him xanthippe was much
affected and showed her grief by loud cries socrates made
a sign to crito to have her removed as be
wished to spend his lajt moments in tran quillity he
then talked with his friends first about his poem then
concerning suicide and at last on the immortality of the
soul the man ner in which the assembled friends in
the al ternation of joyful admiration and profound grief lauded
him as one who by the divine appointment was ing
to a place where it must fare well with him
if with any one how he departed from them with
the one wish that in their care for their true
welfare they would cherish in their memories all his sayings
and how he designated the transition to the life beyond
death as the true recovery from a state of impurity
and diseascj is set down in lively and affecting colors
by his great disciple plato in the dialogue phado the
approach of twilight at length admonished them that the hour
had come he took the hemlock cup calmly and slowly
drank the poison he then walked up and down the
aimrtment trying to console his weeping friends when it became
difficult to walk he lay down upon his couch and
before his heart ceased to beat he exclaimed my friends
ve owe a cock to sculapiu3 he then covei himself
uo with his cloak and calmly expired thus died the
man says plato in his ltphjedogt who of all with
whom we are acquainted was in death the noblest in
life the wisest and most in their accounts of the
life of socrates the two principal authorities xeflophon and plato
substantially agree although the platonic pic ture is sketched with
the more delicate pencil as to their reports of his
doctrine it is first of all undoubtedly true that plato
tn his dia logues generally presents his own thoughts through
the mouth of socrates but in a cer tain sense
his dialogues can nevertheless serve as authorities for the socratic
teaching as the groundwork of the platonic philosophy is contained
in the socratic and as it is possi ble in
general though not in all cases in de tail to
discriminate between the platonic and socratic elements plato was cautious
enough not to be led by his love of idealisation
too far from historic truth in some of his compositions
he remains almost entirely faithful to it and in others
puts those doctrines which socrates could not have professed into
the mouth of other philosophers xenophon wrote the me morabilia
and the symposium not so much in the spirit of
a pure historian as in that of an apologist but
his honorable defense of socrates demands from us entire confidence
in his historic fidelity so far as his intention is
concerned but it must be acknowledged that as much cannot
be said of his intellectual quali fication for an exact
and comprehensive under standing of the socratic philosophy xeno phon
appears to attribute too unconditionally to socrates the tendency natural
to himself to digit zed g00ge socraraa soda connect all
sciemific activity with a practical purpose and be thus gives
too small a place to the dialectic of socrates as
compared with bis ethical teachings the brief statements of aristotle
respecting the philosophical doctrines o socrates are very valuable since
they are purely storical and relate to the most import
ant points of his teaching the previous phil osophies consisted
of vague speculations on nature as a whole combining costnology
as tronomy geography physica metaphysics etc socrates had given much
attention to these subjects and arrived at the conclusion that
the knowledge he had gained was of little practical value
astronomy might have a certain value in navigation and in
the measurement of time and bo should be learned to
some extent by the pilot and the watchman geometry was
useful when confined to land measii ring aritb metic might
be useful in many of the affairs of daily life
and so on but the speculations oii philosophers from thales
downward as to tbe origin of all things out of
fire water air etc he regarded as profitless nay as
impious even do these inquirers be would ask think that
they already know human affairs well enough ttiat they thus
begin to meddle with divine do they think they sball
be able to raise or calm the winds at pleasure
or do they simply seek to gratify vain curiosity tbe
gods managed the operations of nature after their own pleastlre
and refused to submit them to invariaole laws of sequence
such as could be discovered by human study the only
means of knowledge permitted was sacrifice niayer and the consultation
of the oracles iftns strivings after knowledge should he directed
to the human relationships as in volving mens practical concerns

the good is id ejiiral wiithr beautiful a nd the
useriitr ciceros wellknown saying that soc raler called philosophy down
from the heavens to earth ana introduced it into the
cities and houses of men compelling men to inquire con
cerning life and morals and things good and evil indicates
in terms substantially correct the progress of philosophy in socrates
from tbe cosmology and physics of his predecessors to anthropological
ethics he possessed however no complete system of ethical doctrines
but only the living instinct of inquiry and could therefore
naturally arrive at definite ethical jh cor ems only in
conversation with others ttie fundamental thought in his political doc
i trine is that authority properly belongs to tbe 1
intelligent to him who possesses knowledge me good ruler must
be as it were a shepherd to those whom he
rules his business his virtue is to make them happy
socrates did not favor the appointment of officers by popular
suffrage and by lot he defends the belief in the
existence of gods on teleological grounds arguinff from the structure
of organ ized beings and founding his reason on the
general principle that whatever exists for a use must be
die work of intelligoice the wisdom which is present and
rules in all dut exists determines all things according to
its good pleasure it is distinguished from the other gods
as the ruler and disposer of the universe the gods
like the human soul are invisible but make known their
existence im mistakably by their operations it is reported that
soon after the death of the great philosopher the athenians
regretted ibar sentence and that to expiate their crime a
brazen statue the work of lysippus was dedi cated to

sodium by reducing sodi um carbonate with carbon and dcville
in 1855 improved brunners process so as to make it
commercially practicable for the manufacture of sodium on the large

distilling a mixture of 30 parts of calcined carbonate of
sodium 13 parts of coal and 7 parts of lime
the reduction taking place at a temperature of about 2500
f the metal being given off in the form of
a vapor which is then passed into a condenser ana
allowed to liquefy and solidify as thus obtained sodium contains
nutnerous impurities most of which may be removed by straining
the melted metal through linen under rock oil at a
temperature of about 212 f dcvilles process of manufacture was
used al most exclusively until about 1 when the well
known caslner process came into use castner reduced sodium hydroxide

the object of using ihe sodium that it yielded in
the subsequent preparation of metallic aluminum qv and for many
years the commercial supply of aluminum was practically all prepared

in a neutral atmosphere of hydrogen coal gas or some
other substance for wnich it has no affinity it may
be pre pared in the form of lustrous octahedral crystals
white in color but with a rosy sheen like potassium
it dissolves in anhydrous liquid ammonia nhi forming a blue

bromide nabr which is extensively used in medicine as a

pure sodium hydrate naoh till the liquid becomes slightly yellow
it is then evaporated to dryness and stroncly heated to
decompose the bromate nabroi wluch is formed simultaneously with the
bromide after which the residue is redissolved and crystallized by

may be prepared in several ways but it is doubtful
if it has yet been obtained in a state of
absolute purity it is formed when metallic sodium is oxidized
in dry air or dry oxygen at ordinary temperatures but
it is said that some small trace of moisture must
be present in order for the oxidation to pro ceed
this monoxide is a grayish solid having a powerful affinity
for water with which it com bines to form sodium

a considerable quantity of heat the monoxide may also be
prepared by heating dry sodium hydroxide with metallic sodium its
form ation in this case being attended by the liberation
of hydrogen sodium peroxide natoi also called the dioxide is
of considerable com mercial importance ltowing to its increasing use
as a bleaching agent it is prepared by pasdng a
stream of dry air slowly over melted sodium at a
temperature of about 570 f the sodium being thereby converted
into a mixture of the monoxide and peroxide when all
the sodium has been oxidized the air current is replaced
by a stream of dry oxygen gas whidi transforrns the
monoxide that is present into peroxide sodium peroxide is soluble
in water but the solution readily decomposes with the formation
of sodium hydroxide and the liberation of oxygen as indicated
by the equation na 4 hgt 2naoh o the bleaching

the most important chem ical substances known it was formerly
pre pared mainly from the ashes of sealants in uie
same way that carbonate of potassium is obtained from the
ashes of land plants but at the present lime it
is prepared almost exclu sively by chemical means from common
salt for many years the only method in use for
its manufacture was that invented by leblanc dur ing the
first french revolution in the latter part of the 18th
century in 1838 the ammonia process was patented in england
but although this promised to be superior to the method
of leblanc certain practical difficulties were encountered which proved to
be fata to its success until they were overcome by
e solvay who erected the first commercially suc cessful amnioma
process plant near brussels in 1861 and for whom the
process itself has since been named a certain proportion of
the output of sodium carbonate is also manufactured by electrolysis
but the greater part is manu factured by the solvay
process though the leblanc method is still used to a
considerable leblanc procmb in the leblanc method for the manufacture
of sodium carbonate there are two successive operations to be
performed the first of these which is known as the
salt cake process has for its object the transforma tion
of chloride of sodium into suliate of sodium for this
purpose the salt sodium chloride is heated with sulphuric acid
tn large d google covered iron pan hydrochloric acid being
liberated in the coarse of the reaction as indi cated

this part of the process takes its name pure crystallized
sodium sulphate con taining 10 molecules ot water of crystallization
constitutes the familiar substance known as glaubers sajl which is
used in medicine as a saline purgative the saltcake as
obtained by the first operation is subsequently treated by the
black ash process which is so called on account of
the color of the immediate product uiat it yields ten
parts of the saltcake are mixed with 10 of limestone
calcium carbonate and seven and a half of coke and
the mixture i is heated in a reverberalory furnace technically
known as a balling furnace the carbon of the coal
reduces the crude sodium sulphate to i the form of

equation i naso t 2c nas 2c0 while the sulphide
thus produced is converted into sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide

equation nas caco narf0 cas in practice these two reactions
go on to gether and the final mixture of calcium
sul dtide sodium carbonate and such impurities as may be
present is the socalled blackash or crude soda calcium sulphide
is insoluble in water in the presence of lime and
hence it is easy to separate the sodium carbonate from
the mass by solution and subsequent crystallization cryataluzed soda or

through subsoil to the underlying undecom posed rock the subsoil
is distinguished from the surface soil mainly by a smaller
percentage of organic matter and greater compactness the latter being
due to the accumulation of finer particles carried down by
percolating water clay subsoil or to the formation of itardpan
resulting from the compacting effect of con tinued cultivation at

shown that on account of the absence of the leaching
action of water the soils of and re gions are

physical and chemical examinations considering the soil mainly as a
medium into which plants send their roots and from which
they draw a part of their food it is evident
that its agricultural value will depend largely upon the character
of the original rocks from which the soil was derived
the degree of fineness to which the ma terial has
been reduced the amount and char acter of the organic
admixture as well as upon the treatment to which the
soil has been sub jected and the changes it undergoes
under culti vation the fertility of a soil is therefore
de termined not only by the store of plant food
which it contains but depends to a large extent upon
the chemical physical and biological proc esses by which this
plant food is rendered available to plants the soil is
not only a store house of plant food but a
workshop or labora tory in which this food is being
constantly pre pared for the use of plants and it
is the object of cultivation to promote the processes by
which this is brought about chemical physical and biological properties
and processes are so intimately associated in soil that it
is not always possible clearly to distinguish between them for
convenience of discussion however it is desirable to consider them
separately chemical composition and propcrticb of soils plants derive all
of their ash or mineral constituents and a large part
of their nitrogen from the soil and in order that
a soil may pro duce plants it must contain these
constituents in proper proportion and in assimilable con dition nitrogen
is one of the largest and most important constituents of
plants the ash con stituents are taken up in comparatively
small amounts by plants but they arc none the less
essential to their growth the more import ant mineral elements
of plant food include sulphur phosphorus potassium calcium mag nesium
and iron apparently sodium silicon and manganese are also needed
by plants since the rocks from which soils are derived
contain more or less of all the mineral elements it
is not likely thai any soil will be entirely lacking
in any of those required their proportion and availability for
assimiliation by he plant may however vary so widely as
to cause wide differ ences in productiveness the constituents of
soils may he divided into three classes 1 active that
is soluble in water or the root secretions of plants
and hence readily available 2 latent that is not soluble
in water or root secretions and hence not readily available
but becoming so in time through natural agencies by the
apphcatton of fertilizers or soil amend ments such as lime
marl etc or as a result of tillage and 3

phobphoiic acid i nibbgminiou it will be observed that the
proportions of actual fertilizing constituents nitrogen phos phoric acid potash
lime etc are relatively small when however the amounts per
acre are taken into consideration they assume greater importance an
acre of sandy soil to a depth of one foot
may be assumed to weirfj about 4000000 pounds of loam
soil 3500000 pounds of clay soil 3250000 pounds an acrefoot
of loam soil of the humid region having the aver
age composition given above would therefore contain 7350 pounds of
potash 4550 pounds of lime 4203 pounds of phosphoric acid
and 4200 pounds of nitrogen amounts sufficient to sup ply
the needs of many crops it should be borne in
mind however that these are average figures from which there
may be wide depart ures even in soils of the
same type and that productiveness of a soil as determined
by chem ical composition depends as already stated not so
much upon the total amounts of the con stituents present
as upon their availability for the uses of plants ordinarily
chemical analysis may show the presence of largr amounts of
all the necessary fertihzing constituents and still the soil may
be unproductive if these con stituents are not in a
form in which they may be readily appropriated by the
plant chcmiou analysis is capable of showing the presence absence
or marked deficiency of any necessary constituent or the presence
of harmful sub stances but it has not yet reached
such a stage of perfection that it can show with
absolute certainty the amount of available plant food which a
soil contains the methods most commonly used tor de termining
the availability of plant food in soils involve the treatment
of the soil with a weak solvent such as 1
per cent citric acid fifth normal nitric acid carbonated water
or am monia chloride solution which it is asstuned approximates
the power of plants to utihze the soil constituents schloesing
among others has called attention to the importance of studying
the availability of plant food in the soil by means
of water extracts but the bureau of soils of the
united states department of agri d google culture applying a
method based upon the sokibility of the soil constituents in
water to a large number of productive and unproductive soils
of the united stales reached the conclu sion that practicall
all cultivable soils con tain naturally a nutrient solution which
varies within comparatively narrow limits with regard either to composition
or concentration and which is usually sufhcient for plant growth
and that therefore there is no obvious relation between the
chemical composition of the soil and solution and the yield
of crops the work of others however indicate that the
growth of plants in the water extracts of soil closely
par allel their growth in the soil from which the
extracts are made the recent development of centrifui dbplacement or
pressure methods of obtaining unaltered or but little changed soil
solutions in quantity permits of important in vest gallons oo
this piit not heretofore possible the availability of the soil
constituents de pends largely upon the extent to which disin
tegration has proceeded and the amount of leaching to which
the soil has been subjected thus in the soils of
arid regions in which disin tegration has been going on
uninterruptedly for ages with no leaching the soluble salts are
always found in large and often in excessive amounts as
for example in the socalled alkaii soils which are simply
soils containing an excess of soluble salts accumulated at or
near the swfac and which when this excess is removed
thspersed or otherwise rendered in nocuous are among the most
fertile known chemical analysis shows soils to be very variable
in composition and since the processes by which soils are
formed and plant food ren dered available are continually going
on fre quent examinations are necessary if accurate knowledge of
the chemical properties of a soil at any given time
or of the amounts of plant food ted chemical analysis
must not be talten as an absolute guide to the
fertilizer deficiencies and requirements of soils certain general de ductions
have been drawn from soil analyses which may be of
practical value if applied with discriminatioa for example german authori
ties classify soils on the basis of their chemical analysis
as follows soils containing less than 005 per cent of
either nitrogen or phosphoric acid are considered as poor those
containing from 005 to 01 per cent moderately rich 01
per cent average or normal from 010 to 015 per
cent ood and above 015 per cent rich soils containing
less than 005 per cent of potash are classified as
pcwr from 005 to 015 per cent moderately rich from
ois to 025 per cent average or normal and over
025 per cent rich loam soils containing less than 01
per cent of lime are classified as poor from 01
to 025 per cent moderately rich from 025 to 05
per cent average or normal from 05 to 1 jwr
cent good and over 1 per cent rich sandy soils
con taining less than 005 per cent of lime are
clas sified as poor liora 05 to 01 per cent
mod erately rich from ftl to 02 per cent average
or normal over 02 per cent of lime is not
often fouod in sandy soils the minimum percentages of the
different mineral elements in the smis of th united l
aar states which according to hilgard chemical analysis has found
to be necessary to the thrifty frowth of genera crops
may be summarized as hows potash may vary widely without
ma terial effect but should not as a rule be
less than 025 per cent onetenth per cent of phosphoric
acid is adequate and there should not be less than
005 per cent of it the greater the proportions of
lime and humus and the less the amount of iron
in the soil the smaller the percentage of phosphoric acid
re quired onetenth per cent of nitrogen is ade quate
lime should not fall below tl per cent in sandy
soils nor 06 per cent in heavy clay soils as
a general rule the larger the propor tion of lime
present the lower the percentages of potash phosphoric acid and
nitrogen re quired magnesia is seldom deficient iron is usually
present in abundance humus which modem investigation has shown to
be a variable complex of many substances and not a
definite compound may van widely in amount and nitrogen content
the humus of humid soils usually contains a smaller percentage
of nitro gen than that of soils of arid regions
humus is not only important as a source of supply
of nitrogen but also of other plant food constitu ents
pidtash phosphoric acid lime etc ac cording to snyder the
liroportion of these con stituents combined with humus represents to
a large extent the amounts available in the soit an
important property of soils which is partly chemical and partl
physical is their absorptive power for fertilizing constituents which prevents
these constitutntb from being lost in the drainage or dissipated
in other ways before the plant can utilize them oi
the more important fertilizing constituents soils ap parently have the
least retentive power for nitrogen especially in the form of
nitrates and the greatest for phosphoric acid soils ap jiarently
hold lime less tenaciously than pota since it has been
shown that when potassium chloride is added to a soil
the potash is retained by the soil and the lime
of the soil passes into the drainage in combination with
the chlorine physical properties and processcb the physical properties of
soils which are of special importance are color weight fineness
of divi sion or texture arrangement of particles or structure
adhesiveness and relations to heat gases water and dissolved solids
the physi cal properties of soils are to such a
large extent inherent that the common practice ot selecting soils
with special reference to the suitability of their physical properties
to the crop to be grown is usually a wise
one nevertheless good tilth with good water conditions aeration and
tem perature as well as an adequate supply of plant
food which are so essential to productiveness may be modified
and improved to a considerable mtenl by proper management culture
and fer tilizing and with the improved physical condi tions
the chemical and biological processes of the soil come effectively
into play the physical properties of soils depend largely upon
the rriative proportions of stones gravel sand clay lime and
organic matter pres ent sandy soils are as a rule
light colored drv warm of low adhesive power have little
toxic csact on plmt dgt google absorptive capacity for moisture
and fcrtilisine matter and are generally poor clayey soils are
more adhesive and have a stronger absorp tive power for
water and fertilizing matter they are as a rule wetter
cooler and more dif ficult to work than sandy soils
but are naturally more fertile soils containing a considerable amount
of humus are dark colored and lixht in weight and
have a strong absorjitive power hence humus soils are frequently
wet soils lime improves the structure of both sandy and
clayey soils hastens the decay of organic mat ter corrects
addihr and promotes nitrification and other beneficial bactenal activities the
color of soils is determined in most cases by the
proportions of organic matter and oxide of iron they contain
and is of little im portance except that it probably
affects in some degree the temperature of the soil see

of soils to water the devdop ment of plants is
impossible without a sufficient supply of water in the soil
at all periods of growth water is not only an
important con scituent ot plant tissue but it is of
the greatest importance as a solvent and carrier of food
in the soil and in the plant a comparatively snjall
part of that taken into the pluii is used to
build tissue the larger part igtassing out through the leaves
by transpiration which is however essential to the healthy growth
of the plant it is estimated that for each pound
of dry matter produced in the crop from 250 to
500 pounds of water is drawn from the soil all
soils are capable of absorbing and retaining moisture but the
extent to which thev do so varies widely a fact
whidi is of great import ance in determining the mutual
adaptabiuty of crops and soils as a rule the capaci
of sotk to hold water is proportional to the size
of the soil particles the finer the particles the larger
the total surface area of the particles and the greater
the capacity for water although this is not invariably truo
king has computed the pore space and surface area of
the particles of different kinds of soils as follows texture
and stmctare of soils the pro dtictiveness of a soil
depends to a conuderable extent upon its texture fineness ol
particles and structure arrangement of particles these properties determine largely
die circulation of water and gases the solution and retention
of sant food and the growth of roots of plants
ood texture and structure thus enable a poor soil to
produce better crops than a more fertile soil of which
the texture and structure are not o good one of
the main objects of tillage is to promote better soil
texture and structure these properties are affected to a considerable
extent by various fertilizers for instance lime has the power
of flocculating the soil particles and thus renders soils more
porous while sodium nitrate and many other substances have a
tendency to puddle the soil that is to keep the
particles separate and thus prevent the open floccular structure soils
containing large amounts of clay and other fine particles are
most injured by puddling and hence most bene fited by
floccufatink by means of lime reuition of sods to heat
the tempera ture of the surface soil is subject to
the same changes as that of the air hut these
changes occur more slowly the variations decrease as the depth
increases until they finally disappear there are several modifying influences
affecting the temperature of the soil the first of these
is color a dark colored soil is usually warmer one
containing much clay or humus as already intimated soils exposed
so as to receive a large amount of the direct
rays of the sun are warmer than those not having
such exposure probably the most important factor determining the temperature
of a soil is its water content a wet soil
is cold evaporation is a cooling process and the heat
necessary to carry it on porcqscfi r ii a coarse
sand allows water to run throu freely retaining relatively little
while fine clay absorbs and retains a large amount the
pro portion of organic matter is also an imjiortant factor
in determining the waterholding ca pacity of soils the larger
the proportion of or ganic matter the greater the capacity
of the soil for holding water healthy root development is
not possible in a soil saturated with moisture the most
favorable amount of water for plant growth is stated to
be from 40 to 75 per cent of that which
the soil is capable of holding when completely saturated another
important factor to be taken into consideration is that soils
vary in the readiness with which they give up water
to growing plants when the amount becomes limited trops can
utilize a larger proportion of the water in open coarsegrained
sandy soils than of that in compact finegrained clay soils
in other words plants will suffer from drought on compact
clay soils containing a proportion of moisture which would be
entirely sufficient for their needs on sandy soils thus white
sandy soils have a much smaller total storuge capad for
water than day soils the available water is more nearly
equal in the two cases than would at first be
supposed sachs found diat tobacco plants began to wilt when
the water content of sandy soit was reduced to 15
per cent of clay d google scnu to 8 wt
cent and of sand and humus to 12j per cent
water exists in soils in three different state which may
be icnned hydrostatic capillary and hygroscopic hydrostatic water is that
which fills the soil sces and would drain away if
given cqqnrlunity its upper surface stands at a certain level
which b known as the water table capillary ltor film
water is that which is capable of rising in the
soil or of moving from a more moist to a
less moist part of the toil under the influence of
snrface tension with out regard to the force of gravtiy
hygroscopic water is that which closely surronnds the soil particles
but is not affected by gravity and does not move
through the soil under the in fiuence of surface tension
capillarv water is often drawn from the hydrostatic supply and
is the most important from the staatoint of plant growth
hygroscopic water is not ot great ue to vegetation heinrir
found that plants begn to wtit before the water content
of oils is reduced to the hygroscopic limit soil water
when present in sufficient amount is constantly in motion in
case of rainfall irrigation or the melting of snows the
moisture sinks inkgt the toil carnnng along with it oxy
gen carbonic acid nitric add ammonia etc and rendering plant
food available a part of whkh may be lost in
the drainage if the water supply is excessive this downward
movement or percolation of water due to gravity is most
rapid in soils of small retentive power thai is coarsenned
open soils agencies like lime which fiocculate the soil particles
and loosen the soil promote percolation and those like alkali
salts which tend to compact the soil and puddle its
particles retard it when the supply of water ceases evaporation
commences and the soil water begins to rise by capillarity
carrying along with it dissolved plant food which ac cumulates
in the surface soil within easy reach of the toots
of plants a barmiul accumulation of soluble salts alkali however
is chug some dmes brout about in rons of deficienl
or irregular rainfall the capillary properties of soils are of
great importance since they determine largely the available water supply
of soils difierent soils vaiy widely as regards the amount
of capillary water they retain schubler has shown that the
water content ol a soil is a function of its
structure coarse sand somelinms retains as little as 15 igter
cent while heavy clay loam and scnls containing a large
amount of humus often retain as much as 50 to
60 per cent ordinary kgtams retain about 40 per cent
as king ha pointed out however the amount of capillary
water actually found in soils in the tield are as
a rule smaller than the theoretical amounts that ihe soils
are capable of holding and are con trolled to a
large exknt by the depth of the water table which
is constantly fluctuating the capillary movement of water has been
ob served to extend to a depth of seven feet
but declines as the denth of the water table in
creases as a rule the amount of capillary water in
the soil decreases from the water table rard toward the
surface in the fitter soils moisture as a rule rises
more slowly but to a greater height than rn the
coarser the force surface tension which causes water to rise
in a soil also produces a lateral moveinent but this
is much slower than the other all movements of water
become more rapid as the soil angtroaches saturation under orchnary
conditions moisture is con stantly escaping from the soil by
evaporation evaporation ma be reduced by tillage and mtttching which
interfere with the capillary rise of moisture in the soil
and by the use of wind breaks which lessen the
drying effect of winds the belief is common that the
moisture condi tions of soils may be materially modified by
the use of fertilizers more especially by the ampli cation
of comncm salt but careful observations and experiments on this
point have failed to show any decided effect in increasing
the water content of soils by ordinary appucations of salt
and similar siibstances colloidal substances in humus clay and the
like appear to play an important part in smls influencing
especially thdr absorptive properties unfortunately exact knowledge on this point
is comparatively limited and not yet sufficient lor generalization of
much practical significance biolokiol action in the sotl a large
and vei7 important part of the changes which go on
in soils is due to biological processes that is to
the actions of living organisms in cluding the roots of
plants earthworms and other living agencies but espedatly the micro
organisms generally grouped nnder the term bacteria tese play an
important part in fix ing the free nitrogen of the
air in the soil for the use of plants in
converting the organic loss of the soil nitrogen by denitrification
they are also active agents in the disintegra tion of
rocks and the formation of soils and in the formation
of acids from organic matter in the soil thus rendering
the application of time or other neutralizing agents necessary it
is the object of good soil management to so control
the conditions of moisture aeration temperatures etc that the beneficial
biological processes are promoted and the harmful re strained bacterial
life is suspended or may be de stroyed in very
dry soils hence the number ol bacteria in soils is
low after drought and high after rain excessive moisture however
produces conditions reduced aeration acidity etc unfavorable to beneficial organisms
but ftrvorable to harmful organisms such as deiu trifying bacteria
which cause loss of nitrogen or its conversfon into less
assimilable forms and protozoa and similar organisms which feed on
and hence reduce the number of bene ficial organisms hence
it is very important for hacteriological as wdl as other
reasons that soils should be well drained bacterial action is
more intense and longcontinued in warm soils bacteria live but
are not active in frozen soils like the higher plants
they are dor mant in winter but awaken with renewed
life and activity in the spring the prompt ness and
vigor with which they awce depends upon and in a
measure determines whether a smi is early or late about
25 c is considered the ontimtun temperature for the gfowdi
of the more important soil organ isms beneficial organisms do
not as a rule thrive in acid soils hence such
soils should be limed to correct the acidity excessive alkali
d google is also harmful soils must be well supplied
with organic matter humus to furnish the food energy required
by bacteria and with a cerlain amount of phosphate which
is also a necessary food the activity of soil organ
isms is influenced not only by soil conditions but also
by the character of the plants grown on the soil
for example nitrification appears to be more active under corn
than under tim othy and mixed grasses and similar differences
have been noted with other crops among the more active
and important classes of soil onanisms are tnolds which fix
nitrogen produce ammonia and decompose cel lulose mycorrhiea which probably
fix nitro gen actinomycei which decompose organic matter algis which
manufacture food for obotobacler protosoa which prey upon bene ficial
organisms bacteria which oxidize carbon fix and transform nitrogen and
make mineral constituents of the soil available many or ganisms
which cause plant diseases also live in the soil and
play an important part in determin ing its productiveness the
destruction of these organisms as well as those that interfere
with the growth of beneficial bacteria is of great practical
importance from the standpoint of soil sanitation and productiveness so
called exhausted tired or sick soils are very often simply
those in which harmful or ganisms predominate and their productiveness
is readily restored by partial steriliiation by means of heat
as in the cae of the steaming of greenhouse beds
or by the use of volatile antiseptics like carbon bisulphide
toluol and soil tojios the theory has been advanced that
soils are rendered unproductive by the presence of toxic substances
excreted by the roots of plants produced by bacteria or
de rived from the decomposition of organic mat ter according
to russell there is no evidence of the presence of
soluble toxins in normally aerated soils sulhciently supplied with plant
food and with calcium carbonate but toxins may oc cur
on sourgt soils badly aerated and lacking in cakiiun carbonate
or on other exhausted soils there is no evidence of
any plant excretions conferring toxic properties on the soil but
a growing plant may poison its nrigh bour soluble bacterio
toxins are not normal constituents of soils but must repre
sent unusual conditions wherever they occur but the possibility of
the existetke of toxins insoluble in water still remains schreiner
in his exhaustive study of the organic matter of the
soil has isolated a great variety of com poutids some
of which nave toxic properties bxhanstion improtcmcnt and redanui tion
of soils soils are said to be exhausted when they
no longer yield profitable crops but strictly speaking there is
no such thing as abso lute exhaustion of soils however
soils de cline in productiveness both as a result of
loss of fertilizing constituents from the soil and of deterioration
in its physical ami biological con among the principal causes
of loss of soil fertility are i the growth and
tnova of crops without restoring the equivalent of the fertihzing
constituents they contain 2 sur face washing and 3 leaching
all crops con tain a considerable amount of fertilizing mat
ter drawn from the soil and it is held that
if these crops are grown continuously and sold away from
the farm without return of an equivalent in manure or
fertilizers the soil will in time show a decline in
fertility the harm ful effects of surface washing is a
matter of common observation and tieeds no further dis cussion
here the loss of fertility in the drain age water
is generally supposed to be very con siderable and under
certain circumstances this is true depending upon the character of
the soil and the treatment to which it is subjected
and the fertilizers applied leachy soils pan very quickly with
the fertilizing materials ap plied to them unless covered with
crops which utilize the fertilizers promptly and as already shown
certain fertilizers have a tendency to set some of the
soil constituents free and throw them into the drainage water
while these are all possible sources of toss it is
probably safe to say that under ordinary conditions the chances
of loss of any consider able amount of lime potash
or phosphoric acid in the drainage water of soils are
very small as regards the loss of the important and
ex pensive fertihzing constituent nitrogen how ever the case is
very different the soil ap pears to have very little
affinity for one of tne forms of this element most
commonly used as a fertilizer namely nitrate of soda and
if it is not ltuickly taken up by the crop
it is likely to pass into the drainage and be
lost moreover other less soluble forms of nitrogen are under
favor able conditions rajidly converted into nitrates by the process
of nitrification and so may also be lost in the
drainage dirain has reported experiments in which the loss of
nitric nitrogen in the drainage from a bare soil in
the course of a year was nearly is pounds per
acre while the toss from a soil whicji was keit
covered by a crop was almost insigtiificant ajthougfa fully as
large an amount of nitrates was formed in the latter
case as in the former under unfa vorable soil conditions
there may be consider able loss of nitrogen through denitrification
unproductiveness due to physical condition may be corrected by a
variety of means includ ing drainage irrigation tillage and by
a judi cious system of cropping and the proper use
of tnanures and fertibxers there are large areas of swamp
marsh or muck soils which prove highly productive when reclaimed
in reclaiming such soils the first essential is thorough drainage
this is not only necessary for tile purpose of removing
the ex cess of water but to allow the free
circulation of air in the soil in order that the
poisonous compounds which are usually present may be oxituzed and
thus rendered harmless and that the processes of decomposition atgtd
nitrification so necessary to render plant food available in this
class of soil may be set up paring and burning
lo a depth of 12 to 16 inches as prac
tised in ireland and in european countries and the liberal
use of manures and fertilizers may often be necessary in
addition to drainage since such soils are as a rule
deficient in irfiosphoric acid and potash and although composed almost
entirely of organic matter they are often de ficient in
available nitrogen lime and the bulky manures often exert a
beneficial eflecl on the texture of the soils rendering them
more porous and thus improving drainage and d google soil
soil survey osl increasing aeration and nitrification liberal applications of
wood aes also improve the texture of tlie soil correct
acidity and favor nitrification and at the same time furnish
pot ash and phosphoric add an application of a mixture
of kainit or muriate of potash with some cheap phosphate
such as fineground florida phosphate may be substituted for the
ashes the untreated mineral rfiohates have been used with advantage
on muck soils the decomposing orgfanic matter assisting in ren
dering the phosphoric acid available there are large areas of
sandy lands in different parts of the united states which
are extremely deficient in plant food but which prove vei
valuable for a variety of purposes but especially for early
crops when they are properly managed one of the first
require tnents of such soils is an increase of humus
to improve their waterholding capacity the most effective means which
has been found for increasing the bumus supply in such
soils is the growing and turning under of green crops
preferably leguminous plants which arc nitro gen collectors moderate limii
has also been found beneftcial in many cases hethoda of
intcstigation three prin cipal methods are employed in studying the
characteristics and requirements of soils namely 1 mechanical and chemical
analysis 2 experiments in lysimeters pits pots or boxes and
3 field experiments the nature of the methods pursued in
the chemical inves tigation of soils has already been indicated
the object of mechanical anahrsis is to separate the soil
into particles of dinerent degrees of fineness so that a
basis may be secured for judging of the physical properties
of the soil mechanical analysis as ordinarily practised separates a
soil into what is termed skeleton consisting of coarse particles
like gravel and coarse sand larger than os millimeter in
size and fine earth which includes all particles passing a
sieve with meshes 05 milumeier in diameter the fine earth
is further separated into some six different grades ranging from
medium sand with particles 025 to 05 milli meter in
diameter through fine sand silt to day the particles of
which are less than 0005 milhroeter in diameter the methods
of me chanical analysis which have been employed are of
three classes 1 hydraulic hilgard schone nobel 2 sedimentation osborne
schtoesing knop and 3 centrifugal the methods which have been
most commonly used in the united states are modifications either
of osbornes beaker sedimentation method or hilgards elutrialor hydraulic method
the physical examination of a soil also involves determinations of
waterholding capacity rate ot percolation capillary rise hygroscopicity adhesive oower
etc for all of which ingenious methods have been devised
soil survcya the soils of the united states have been
studied to a considerable ex tent by the agricultural experiment
stations but while the work of the stations on soils
has been quite varied and extensive it has not been
systematic the need for systematic and con certed study of
soils has however been met by the oreaniiatian and development
of die work of bie bureau of soils of the
united states department of agriculture which imder takes the survey
mapping and study of soils on a scale never before
attempted in the in auguration of this work it was
recognized that differences of commercial value could be seen in
the field from the character of the soil and from
its relation to crops and vegetation that it was quite
possible to map these soil areai independently of the geology
of the area or the exact chemical or tniysical charaaer
of the soil that the proper course was to ponstnict
maps in the field showing the area and dis tribution
of the soil types to explain as fully as possible
from geological considerations the origin of the soil and to
have the soil chemist and physicist study the differences in
the sltril types note is also made of climatic and
economic conditions which may sificantly affect the cropping practice extensive
labor atory investigations supplemental to the field operations are conducted
with a view to deter mining the chemical and physical
properties of soils improving methods and working out k more
clearly defined classificatioa in germany elaborate soil surveys with ref
erence to physical and chemical properties and productive and taxable
value of the land have been made under government auspices
by the laboratorium fur bodenkunde at berlin a systematic chemical
survey of the soils of bel gium was undertaken under
the direction of the gemblonx statiorl in france soil surveys
have been undertaken by several of the depart ments the
soils being mapped with reference to their crop adaptations and
fertilizer require ments in russia soil surveys have been suc
cessfully prosecuted in several of the govern ments and japan
has made considerable prog ress in work of this character

the system of feeding eruing animals espedatly cattle in bams
ana other enclosurce with freshly cut green crops grown for
the purpose instead of turning them out to pasture the
practice has its roost important application in intensive farming and
on small farms as in europe but is also practised
in other regions where the agricultural resources are undergoing development
from extensive to intensive methods in many parts of europe
the animals are soiled during the whole year never being
allowed to graze at all in the older parts of
america and australia this is also true to some extent
but generally in these newer countries the practice is combined
with pasturing he animals being usually kept in the bams
during the day to reduce annoyance from flies and turned
out to graie at night fall it is also true
in america that the animals are more seldom fed in
bams even during summer than in europe however daity cattle
es neciall in the vicinity of cities are frequently keut
m the stables and fed there the year around with
soiling crops suppicmoited with hay grain and other dry feeds
this practice appears to be growing in popularity in america
soiling first began to attract at tention about 100 years
ago though not until the middle of the past century
did it begin to gain ground rapidly due mainly to
the growth of population and the consequent increase in the
values of land more especially in the north eastern quarter
of the united states and ad jacent canada agricultural literature
shows that at that time the plants most favored were
the taller growing fodder crops such as timothy red clover
oats cabbage and various roots es pecially mangels turmps and
carrots while all these are more or less popular at
the present time millet rape sorghum kaffin com crimson clover
cow peas soy beans and alfalfa and combiualions of canada
field peas with oats or barley and winter vetch with
rye have more than supplementedwell nigh supplanted them in general
favor this is mainly because these crops cover the whole
season toore complete than the former list and also yield
larger quanti ties of fodder on given areas especially is
this vith alfalfa which not only may be milk forming
compounds in the middle west where areas are less restricted
than in the east and where natural grasses are abundant
pasturing rather than soiling is the vogue bui even here
the newer practice is gaining headway in the vicinity of
dties because of its economy and expediency there as elsewhere
a larger number or animals may be sustained by an
equal area in pasturage when the animals are confined the
expense of erecting and maintaining fences is eliminated except for
small paddocks the waste of food due to trampling and
defiling with manure is avoided the animals may always be
assured of abundant food the manure may be evenlv distributed
especially when mechanical spreaders are used thus preventing the too
abundant de posits in some parts of the field the
almost en tire lack in others and the irregular distribu
tion between these two extremes except for the increased labor
of handling the food and the manure the system has
no serious disad vantage though it is claimed that animals
thrive best where they are allowed exercise but this may
be secured in summer at least bj the free dom
of a paddock preferably at niit for this last reason
soiling and pasturing are com monly combined in the united
states the pas ture being kept as remote as convement
from the crop fields so the animals may not become
restive and be tempted to break through the fences experiments
have been tried in soiling and bulletins published by various
experiment sta tions more especially those of the east the
bureau of animal industry of the united states department of
agriculture has also issued in formation on this subject u

system a modem scientific method of classifying ex plaining and
teaching the facts of music of especial value in the
acquisition of the art of sightsinging the system proceeds on
the principle of giving the chief prominence to the fact
that there is in realihr but one scale in music

the key the seven notes of the diatonic scale are
represented by the solfeggio qv syllables or ratber modifications of

scale or dia gram called the modulator representing pictorialty the
exact intervals of a key with the semitones in their

posed to occupy the time from that accent to the

previous note through another pulse or beat a dot divides
a pulse into equ sub divisions a dot after a
mark of continuance indicates that previous note is to be
continued through half that pulse a comma indicates that the
note preceding ii fills a quarter of the time from

has however been objected to by others from its withdrawal
of the direct indication of both absolute and relative pitch
to the eye which exists in the common notation from
its limiled applicabihty to instrumental music and from its acquirement
not being like that of the ordinary notation an introduction
to the world of musical literature it presents however no
barrier but rather a road to the acquisition of the
older notation and its widespread use and the testimony of
the general body of practical teachers are eloquent arguments in
its favor in the history of music various attempts have
been made to introduce a musical nota tion in which
the staff with its lines and spaces is dispensed with

where the notes of the scale were indicated by the
arabic numerals a principle which is the chief feature of
the chevi system largely used in france the timenames of

been built at south pasadena cal and here is an

solar system that collection of bodies of which the earth
on which we dwell is one and which are distinguished
from all other bodies in the universe by having the
sun as the centre of their motions the bodies of
this system may be classified as follows 1 the sun
the great central body shed ding its tight and heat
on all the other bodies and by its powerful attraction
keeping them in their several oruts it is the fountainhead
of all life on the earth it is about 750
times as massive as all the other bodies of the
system put together hence its attractive power on all these
bodies for a full description of this great luminary see
sun 2 the planets bodies which revolve round the sun
in elliptic orbits generally differing little from circles the planets
are opaque and are therefore visible to us only by
reflecting the light of the sun they are divided into
two classes major and minor planets the major planets are
eight in number their names distances and many other particu
lars respecting them will be found in the table appended
to this article it will be seen that the most
distant neptune is more than 70 times as far from
he sun as the nearest mercui an idea of the
arrangement of the planets wul be gathered from the accompanying
plate it will be noticed b the plate that there
is a p between the orbits of mars and jupiter
this is tilled by the second class of planets called
minor planets or asteroids these bodies are much smaller than
the major planets and generally revolve in more eccentric orbits
it is impossible to say exactly how numerous they may
be more than 800 are now known new ones constantly
being discovered and there may be hundreds or even thousands
so smalt that they have not been discovered and may
never be separately reccnized see asreroidb 3 the satellitea of
the planets all the major planets with the exception of
the two inner ones have one or more smaller bodies
revolving round them and accompanying them in their courses round
the sun in this respect each of the planets having
satellites may be said to form a solar system in
miniature since the motion of the satellites round the planet
is quite similar to that of the latter round the
sun the number of satellites is as follows there are
therefore 27 satellites now known the system formed by a
planet and its satellites is designated by the name of
the ytanel thus we have the martian system the ovian
system the satumian system etc 4 comets comets generally revolve
in orbits so eccentric that during he greater part of
their course they are entirely invisible even to telescopic vision
a few are known to revolve within the ormt of
jupiter and all that we can observe must have their
perihelion not more than two or three times as far
as the earths orbit otherwise they would be for ever
invisible their times of revolution vary all the way from
three years to unknown thou sands of years those having
long perioiis gfgt far beyond the orbit of neptune during
their eourse no limit can be set to their number
keplers remark that the heavens may be as full of
comets as the sea of fish though prob ably an
exaggeration is well fitted to give an idta of the
passible number of these bodies it is certain that only
an insignificant fraction of the total number has ever been
seen by human eye see comets amp meteorites or meteors
which must be countless millions of millions in number are
so minute that we never see them individually except when
they strike our atmosphere and form a shooting star see
shootinc stars they may be classed with comets because the
latter are probably of meteoric constitution perhaps made up of

which is a great lens shaped cloud of small particles
surrounding the sun and extending nearly to the orbit of
the elanet mars this doud is thickest at the sun
ut has a repion of reversed curvature within the orbit
of mercury its form may be quite closely represented by
two ellipsoids of revolu tion having the centre of the
sun for their common centrcj the eccentricity of the inner
being about 02 and the outer having the form af
a thin ellipsoidal sheet within which the a remarkable feature
of the solar system is the clear separation of the
eit major planets into two groups equal in numbers each
com prising four planets with distinctive character istics the inner
four of which our earth is one are dense and
highly compressed solid bodies the four janets of the outer
up are many times more massive than the inner ones
the least massive of all uranus being seven or eight
times as weighty as the four inner ones put together
as compared with the inner group the planets of the
outer group are also distingnished by being larger in a
yel greater proportion than they are massive any one of
the inner group would be a small object alongside the
smallest of the outer group a similarity of constitution also
seems to mark the outer planets it is highly probable
that all are surrounded by dense atmospheres gt in fact
that each consists of a comparatively small nucleus surrounded by
a gaseous envelope with clouds floating in it as they
do in our atmos phere poauble unknowa planetbthe excessive motion
of the perihelion of mercury as well as smaller but
welldefined motions in the node of venus and the perihelion
of mars none of which could be accounted for by
the disturb ances caused by the attractions of the known
bodies of the solar system long ago led to the
suspicion that there might be one or even a ring
of undiscovered planets revolving about the sun within the orbit
of mercury should such planets exist they ought from time
to time to pass betvjeen us and the sun so
as to be visible on the disc of the latter
several ob servers studying the sun have supposed that they
saw sudi objects but there is no doubt that they
were mistaken for 20 years past the sun has been
photographed almost every day as well as constantly scanned by
the telescope in europe and in america no photograph has
ever shown and no really experienced observer has ever seen
anything of the sort another way of detecting such bodies
would be by scan ning the neighborhood of the sun
during total eclipses this has been done at almost every
such eclipse during the last 30 years more over in
recent times photography has been called to the aid of
the search especially by the lick observatory in california in
one of the attempts stars were photographed down to nearly
the eighth magnitude but nothing was ever found except known
stars we may there fore regard the nonexistence of any
visible planet between mercury and the sun as well proved
in addition to this the most interesting dis covery was
made by seeliger in 1906 that the outstanding discrepancies in
the motions of the planets can be fully accounted for
by the dis turbing pull of the zodiacal light provided
that we ascribe to this oiify an almost inconcdvabte tenuity
it is suffiaeni to assume that fe densest portioa has
but 2s2 by 10 toi le density of the sun
in order that its mass may be great enough to
produce the disturbances observed moreover it is foimd that on
this assumption no new disturbances are introduced into the perturbations
of any of the planetary elements of a size great
enough to be evident to observation the question whether there
may be a planet beyond neptune is not so easily
settled the robable existence of such a body has been
in erred on three grounds 1 outstanding dis crepancies in
the computed motion of uranus 2 the existence of certain
comets the aphelia of whose orbits lie outside the orbit
of neptune and 3 the inference based on the planetesimal
theory of the development of the solar sjstem that the
orbit of the outermost planet will not he a nearly
circular one of diese the first furnishes the most reliable
evidence and it alone can serve as a basis for
predicting the planets position and so leading to its discovery
if indeed il has an existence in the coune of
a century accurate observations of uranus will have accumulated throughout
the entire circuit of its orbit and by this time
also the motion of neptune will have been sufficient to
indicate the position of the planet as yet however an
accurate indication is not possible and careful search for the
body has met with no success it is inferred that
it is from the 12th to the 13th magtiitude with
an apparent diameter of perhaps 1 as it is so
far distant from the sun its motion among the stars
is certainly very slow and all of the circumstances contribute
to render its discovery extremely difficult the planets are all
so distant from us that to the naked eye they
appear like stars for the most part the five nearest
to us would be classed among the brightest of the
stars venus and jupiler being generally brighter than any fixed
star they are also distinguished from the stars by their
apparent motions which may be seen by watching them from
night to night their apparent situations relatively to the sun
are called aspects the latter are different ac cording to
whether the ortrit of the planet is inside or outside
that of the earth that is whether it is an
inferior or superior one a glance at the arrangement of
me system will show that the inferior planets mercury and
venus can never be seen in the opposite direc tion
from the sun but only seem to swing back and
forth on each side of the sun as they per
form their revolutions around this luminary their apparent distance east
or west from the sun at any time is called
their elongation at the greatest elongation venus is about 4s
de grees from the sun and mercury at different distances
generally ranng between 20 and 30 degrees accorditw to its
position in its very eccentric orbit but the superior planets
seetn to course relatively to the sun all the way
round the sky in performing their revolution when in the
oiqiosile direction from the sun they are said to be
in opposition this is the most favorable time for obsqfving
them because hey are then nearest to the earth and
their visible hemisphere is fully illuminated they then rise alxt
the time of sunset and cross the meridian about midnight

to join or unite metals the principle involved is that
the molten alloy apphed shall partly fuse the metal surfaces
thus creatine a metallic union as a rule the solder
should be easier of fusion than the metal to which
it is applied the solder should also be of or
near the same color as the metal for line steel
copper and brass work gold or silver may be employed
but broadly spring iron is soldered with copper and copper
and brass with tin the most usual solders are the

hard and soft any solder that requires a red heat
for melting is termed a hard solder these are ductile
will bear hammering and are commonly prepared of the same
metal as that which is to be soldered with the
addi tion of some other by which a greater degree
of fusibility is obtained thou the addition is not always
ruired to he itself easier of fusion under this head

gold and silver or gold and copper or gold silver

for fusion by ihe admixture of 116 of line the
hard solder for brass is ob tained from brass mixed
with a sixth or an eighth or even onehalf of
zinc which may also be used for the hard solder
of copper the soft solders melting below a red heat
are much used in plumbing and tinnine they meit easily
but are usually brittle and therefore cannot be hammered tin
and lead in equal parts make a good soft solder
of easier fusion is that consisting of bismuth tin and
lead in equal parts in the operation of soldering the
surfaces of the metal to be joined must be made
very clean and applied to each other it is usual
to secure them by a ligature of wire or other
device the solder is laid upon the joint together with
salammoniac and borax or com imn glass according to the
degrees of heat intended these additions defend the metal from
oxidation glaziers use resin and pitch is sometimes employed tin
foil applied be tween the joints of fine brass work
first moist ened with a strong solution of salammoniac makes
an excellent juncture care being taken to avoid too much
heat it was at first found very difficult to solder
aluminum but a satis factory solder was found in an
alloy of gold silver and copper to which some add
a little zinc soft solder is applied with a soldering
iron or in some cases with a machine as in
closing fruit cans the regular soldering iron has a pointed
copper head and a wooden handle in use the copper
head is heated almost to redness and having been carefully
cleaned and scraped it is used to pick up some
of the molten solder and apply it to the work
the surface or edges to be soldered must be guite
dean and bright and the process is assisted by a
flux as of resin or chloride of zinc hard solder
is essential for joining steel iron gun metal brass etc
and permits a much stronger jrant than soft solder the
process of applyin hard solder is often called brazing from
the similar ity of the alloy used to brass common

heat is abstracteil in general fusion im plies an addition
of heat energy and solidifi cation implies its abstraction thus
to freeie one pound of water it is necessary to
abstract from it an amount of heat energy diat would
be sufficient to raise the temperature of a pound of
liquid water by about 140 degrees of the fahren heit
scale and in order to melt the pound of ice
a precisely equal quanty of heat energy must be added
to it again all liouids may be divided into two
general classes wnose laws of solidification are apparently very different
the first class includes bodies such as wax and glass
which when they are cooled pass into the solid state
by a transition so gradual that it is impossible to
assign any definite temperature at which the transformation can be
considered to take place hie other class includes sabstancei d

until all of the liquid has been transformed into the
solid form in some cases the solid body that is
obtained is crystalline in structure and in other cases it
is amorphous in general the temperature or solidihcation of a
substance is identical with the melting point of the same
substance but in some cases the molten condi tion persists
until the mass has been cooled to a temperature materially
lower than the tempera ture of fusion the rare metal
known as gal utuh for example melts at 86 f
but when once melted it may be cooled lo about
36 f before it solidifies this phenomenon the persistence of
the molten condition after the substance has been cooled below
the normal melting point is called surfuston and it may
be rerded as analogous to the supersatu ration that is
sometimes observed in solutions tjv if a small fragment of
solid gallium be added to the molten metal at a
temperature below 86 f solidification at once ensues and in
general it may be said that in any fluid substance
in a state of suffusion solidification is at once in
duced by the addition of a fragment of the same
substance in a solid form some sub stances increase in
volume when they pass from the molten to the solid
state and others de crease for example when water solidifies
it increases in vohime so that the bulk of the
ice that is formed is about oneeleventh peater dian that

metals which give good sharp castings also maintain an increase

the liquid to the solid stale pressure has a marked
influence upon he temperature of solidification and dr james thomson
showed from theoretical principles that under great pressures the temperature
of solidification is lowered in bodies which ex pand upon
solidification and raised in those in which solidification is accompanied

receives the same name solutions in chemistry and physics a
solution is usually defined as a homogeneous liquid in which
two or more chemically dis tinct substances are simultaneously present
many authorities however restrict the term to such homogeneous liquid
mixtures as exhibit a definite osmotic pressure see below others
extend it so as to make it include gaseous mix
tures and even solid mixtures such as alloys in the
present article we shall adopt the former course using the
term to signify a nomogeneous liquid mixture which is capable
of exerting a when a solid substance is dissolved in
a liquid the liquid is called the solvent and the
solid is called the solute when a solution is prepared
by mixing two liquidsj either one of the liquids may
be regarded as the so1venl the other then being called
the solute but it is customary to consider the one
which is present in largest amount as the solvent by
way of illustrating these terms let us suppose that approximatelv
equal masses of water and of anhydrous liquid carbolic acid
are shaken up together the two will not mix freely
at ordinary temperatures but the water will take xtp a
small quantity of the add and the acid mil similarly
take up a small quantiw of the water the mixture
subsiding when the anta tion ceases into two distinct layers
carbolic add preponderalingin the lower one and water in the
upper one the upper laytr may then be reffarded as
a solution of carbolic acid in water and the lower
as a solution of water in carbolic acid carbolic add
being the solute in the upper layer and the solvent
in ihe lower one this distinction is evidently an arbitrary
one however and many cases could be dted in which
it would be impossible to assign any rea son for
regarding either constituent as the solvent in preference to the
other one for example carbolic acid and water dissolve in
each other more and more freely as the tetn perature
rises until at temperatures above im f they mix readily
in all proportions if equal masses of these substances were
mixed at 18s f therefore we could regard either as
the solvent and either as the solute when a solid
substance is dissolved in a liquid it sometimes happens that
there is no marked evidence of chemical change in other
cases however there is a very obvious chemical change when
ordinary cane sugar is dis solved in water a syrupy
liquid results front which the sugar ma be agam obtained
in the same chemical condition as at first by allowing
the water to evaporate at a suffidentiv low tem perature
if sodiiun hydroxide on the other hand is added to
a given mass of hydrochloric add until the acid is
just neutralized it it impossible to obtain either the add
or the sooiimi hydroxide by mere evaporation of the solution
nothing but water passes away in the vapor and the
solid substance that remains behind when the water is all
gone is found to be common salt if we choose
to do so we may regard the mixture of sodium
hydroxide and hydrochloric acid as a solution of the hydroxide
in the add but since we may prepare iden tically
the same ultimate mixture by adding common salt to pure
water it is perhaps more convenient to rerd it as
a solution of common salt in water for the present
we shall take the latter view confining our attention solely
to those cases of solution in which a solid dis
solves in a tiquid without any obvious chemical change when
a solid is added to a liquid for which it
has no chemical affinity it may remain enlt tirely unaffected
in this case the solid is said to be insoluble
in the liquid and no solution is obtained if ihe
solid is not insoliible in the given liquid it gradually
disappears when the two are brought together the part which
ceases to be visible passing into the liquid in the
di solved state in some cases the change is rapid
and in others it is slow it is always accelerated
by atating the solvent some solids appear to mix with
certain solvents in all proportions but in general it will
be found that if the supply of the solid is
suffident there will come a time when under the conditions
of the experiment no more the solid will dissolve the
solu tion is then said to be saturated the quan
tity of a given solute that will dissolve in a
given solvent depends ttpon several drcum stances but most notablv
upon the temperature of the solvent nearly all substances being
more soluble at high temperatures than at lower ones if
a saturated solution of a substance that it more soluble
at hib temperatures than at lower ones is warmed it
becomes capable of tahns up more of the solute and
if such a saturated solution is cooled it usually deposits
some of the solute until its degree of concentration be
comes reduced to that corresponding to satura d google solutions
tiou at the lower temperature it is s possible hawever
to cause a solution t more of the dissolved solid
than corresponds to saturation at a given temperature though this
supersaturated condition is quite unstable glaubers salt that is sulphate
of sodium crystallized with 10 molecules of water ex hibits
supersatu ration in a marked manner if a saturated solution
of this salt be prepared at a certain definite temperature
and then re moved from contact with any particle of
the free undissolved salt its temperature may be lowered by
a considerable amount before crystallization sets in if the smallest
fragment of the solid salt is placed in such a
supersatu rated solution crystallization at once begins proceeding rapidly until
the concentration is reduced to that corresponding to normal satu
ration at the temperature at which the experi ment is
performed pressure appears to in fluence the solubility of a
substance to a measur able extent but the effect of
a change of tem perature is in general far more
marked a solution which is far from being satu rated
by reason of the solvent being present in freat excess
is said to be dilute the phys ical phenomena manifested
by dilute solutions are much more simple than those of
solutions that are nearly saturated in precisely the same way
that the phenomena exhibited by an attenu ated gas are
simpler than those exhibited by the same gas in a
strongly compressed state a solution which is not homogeneous throughout
with respect to concentration but which is diltite in some
places and approxi mates to saturation in others tends to
become of uniform concentration throughout by a process known as
diffusion this consists in the gradual passage of the dissolved
solid away from those regions in which the concentration is
greatest and toward those in which it is least this
tendency was first discovered by parrot in 1815 it was
experimentally investi gated by graham 1s50 so far as concerns
its manifestation in solutions whose internal mo tions are not
restricted in any way and pick in 1855 gave the
fundamental mathematical theory of the process in picks theory it
was as sumed that the quantity of dissolved salt which
diffuses across a given sectional area of the solution in
a ven time is proportional to the rate of variation
of the concentration of the solution per unit of length
of the straight line that is perpendicular to the sectional
area imder consideration this ts entirely analogous to the assumption
made by fourier with regard to the conduction of heat
through a solid and there fore pick was able to
apply the results of pouriers powerful analysis directly tothe prob
lem of diffusion in liquids the subject being essentially mathematical
in nature reference must be made for further particulars to
the works cited at the end of this article it
was known in the 18th centurv that if a plass
vessel is filled with alcohol ana the open ing is
tightly covered with a bladder and the whole is then
immersed in water the contents of the vessel increase so
that the bladder is dis tended and sometimes bursts this
is evidently due to the fact that water enters the
closed vessel by passing through the more or less porous
bladder in other words it is a dif fusion ienomenon
which takes place between two parts of a nonhomogeneons fluid
system e separated from each other by n suggestion due
to traube 1867 prepared dia phragms that were far superior
to the bladders used by earlier experimenters his method con
sisting in forming a precipitate of ferrocyanide of copper within
the pores of a cell of porous earthenware the earthenware
as thus pre pared was rendered semipermeable inas much as
it would allow of the passage of water throu itself
while it would not permit of the passage of any
dissolved substance that the water might contain the porous cell
as thus prepared was filled with a solution of some
sub stance such as sugar or nitre and was then
carefully sealed up save for one small opening to which
a delicate mercury manometer was attached the prepared cell being
then im mersed in a vessel of pure water it
was found that water will enter the cell until the
mercury manometer registers a very considerable pres sure a pressure
of three atmospheres being observed in the case of a
vi per cent solution of nitre the passage of a
liquid in this man ner throu a membrane or other
porous seprnm is called osmosis qv and the maxi mum
or limiting pressure that is attained when the system arrives
at its ultimate condition of equilibrium is called the osmotic
pressure of the solution the osmotic pressure produced by any
given solution is found to be propor tional to the
concentration of the solution this relation being surprisingly accurate so
long as the solution does not approach too closely to
saturation the osmotic pressure is further found to vary with
the temperature of the solu tion and the remarkable fact
has been brought to light partly by experiment and partly
by theory that for any given solution of constant concentration
the osmotic pressure is approxi mately proportional to the absolute
tempera ture de vries has also shown that for non
electrolytes such as solutions of sur or glycerine in pure
water solutions of different iiuistances possess the same osmotic pressures
provided their temperatures are the same ano thev contain the
same number of gram molecules of dissolved substance per tmit
mass of the solvent a grammolecule of any substance is
a quantity such that its weict in grams is numerically
equal to the molecular weight of the substance it is
evident there fore that the osmotic pressure of a dilute
solu tion follows laws that are closely analogous to those
that hold true for attenuated iiases much of the modem
theory of solutions has been built up on this fact
and while some of the reason ing by which students
of physical chemistry draw upon the known facts of gaseous
ther modynamics for information concerning solu tions appears to be
more or less imperfect it must be admitted that the
known analies be tween attenuated gases and dilute nonelec trolytic
solutions are highly interesting and suggestive blagden in 1788 showed
that the freeune point of a salt solution is lower
than that ot pure water by an amount which is
nearly pro girtional to the concentration of the solution so
dg as the solution does not approach too nearly to
saturation odier investigators have d google solutions examined this subject
from time to lime and tsptaaily raoult 1882 who worked
with many different solutes and with several sol vtnta raoults
general conclusion was thai iti any given solvent the reeling
point is low ered by the same amount by the
presence o one grammolecule of any dissolved sulisiance whatever this
law is somewhat too general as it has exceptions which
cannot be here dis cossed but it is sofiicicntly general
and sufr ciently accurate to be of material service in
the determination of the molecular weights of sub stances whose
percentage compositions are known brother methods raoult found also that
the boiung point of a solvent is raised by the
presence of a dissolved substance the elevation being here also
proportional to the concentration of toe solution and being for
any one solvent independent of the nature of the solute
so long as the same number of grammolecules oe the
solute are present in every case this law it also
subject to exceptions but like the freezing point law it
is very useful in the determina tion of molecular weights
by either of these methods it most be remembered that
the molec ular weight of a substance may be and
indeed often is different when the substance is con sidered
in different isical states beckmatin for example found that the
boiline point of carbon disulphide is raised by sulphur by
an amount which indicates that the molecule of sulphur contains
eight atoms when that element is dissolved in carbon disulphide
previous ex periments on the vapor density of sulphur indi
cating that in the vaporous condition its mole cule contains
six atoms in a general way the ultimate nature of
the eocess of solution is explained by the molecu r
theory of matter see lioiscvlan theory but the molecular theory
still leaves much to be desired on this score we
are to think of the solid solute as composed of
a system of mole cules held together by the intermolecular
at tractive forces that cause the parts of solids to
cohere to one another when the solute is f laced
in the solvent the external attractive orce of the solvent
upon the superficial molec ular layers of the solute partially
neutralizes the internal forces by which these molecules are held
in position and more or less of the mole cules
of the solid escape into the solvent as the concentration
of the solution increases an increasing number of the dissolved
molecules will again come within the range of attractichi of
the undissolved portion of the solute in such a wa
as to be caught by the solute and tem porarily
retained as a part of it suuration occurs when the
number of molecules regained by the solute in this way
in any given time be comes equal to the number
lost by it in the same time saturation being thus
determined by the equality of the moleciuar exchanges that take
place in a given time at the surface of the
undissolved solute it is evident thai when no free solid
is present there can be no such equality of exchanges
hence the possibility of a supersaturated solution indefinite super saturation
cannot be experimentally realized however for in the ceaseless rearrangement
of molecules that takes place in a liquid it occa
sionally happens that a certain number of mole cules of
the dissolved substance fortuitously come together in such a way
as to serve as a nucleiis orthe deposition of the
solid and the molecular condition of the dissolved portion of
the solute has been made the subject of much study
when a solute dissolves its dissohidon is almost invariably accompanied
by thermaj changes the solution becoming either cooled or heated
by reason of these thermd changes the phenomena of solutions
may be discussed by the aid of the general laws
of thermodynamics qv without making any special hypotheses as to
the ultimate molecular nature of the solution this gtlan was
carried out with great power by gibbs in his celebrated
paper entitled on the equilibrium of hetero geneous substances transactions
of the con necticut academy of sciences october 1875 his
paper is so exceedingly general and so entiily mathematical that
it is very fhcult to read and hence his methods
are not under stood even yet as widely as they
should be vant hoff and arrhenius attracted more to the
purely physical side of the question and desir ing to
form if possible some sort of a mental image of
the actual processes that are going on have developed a
theory regarding the nature of the dissolved solute which ts
known as th ionic theory or as the elect roljrtic
dissocia tion theory and it is this theor which is
most widely accepted at the present time it has at
least the merit of being suggestive as well as fruitful
in its practical results there is also a socalled hydrate
theory of solutions in which the solute in aqueous solutions
is supposed to form a series of definite hydrates with
the sot vent analogous compounds being also formed in nonaqueous
solutions this theory has had many distinguished supporters among whom
the great russian chemist mendelampit may be specially mentioned in
recent years its most devoted apostle is perhaps s u
pickering who has defended it with ingenuity and power the
literature of the hydrate dieory is not extensive however when
compared with that of the ionic theory and the ionic
theory has the decided preference among physical chemists at the
pres ent time a general presentation of the hydrate tficory
written by mr pickering will be found in watts dictionary
of chemistry article solutions 11 according to the ionic theory
of vant hoff and arrhenius the solute in a solution
is dis sociated more or less completely into little bodies
called ions the cussociation being slight or even zero in
some cases and very ex tensive in others in a
sohttion such as that of sur in waterj which does
not conductr electricity electrolytically there is little or no ionizatiod
or dissociation of the sohite mole cules into ions while
in a salt solution wfaidh docs conduct electrolytically die dissociation
is large and may even be almost comidete when the
solution is very dilute the ions are not necessarily identical
with the atoms although they may be so in certain
cases when sulphuric add and water compose the solution tbe

the ions are here afomj of sodium and chlorine and
not tiiou tulfs the molecules of these substances having the
respective formulae nsi and cli and being aerefore composed in
each case of two ions mned ttther here as in
the case of sul phion the ions are seen to
be incapable of free existence because when the sodium and
the chlorine are set free by electrolysis or other wise
it is a mcucitlar aggregate that is ob tained and
not a collection of the free ions the completeness of
the ionization of a solute is aampected by various circumstances
but most notably by the degree of concentration of the
solution and the oroportion of the solute mole cules that
are dissociated in aay ven solution may be numerically delerminea
by various methods for which the special works on solu
tions must be consulted it is important to observe that
ions are entirely different thin from electrons the electrons being
the ulti mate particles of which the atoms are supposed
to be built up while the ions are either the
fttotns themselves or else larger systems com posed of the
atoms see elecnton tkeoby the dissociated ions in a solution
are supposed to be endowed with electric charges the two
ions into iriiich any given molecule is separated be ing
charged oppositely in the case of sodium chloride for example
the sodium ion is charged positively and the chlorine ion
n natively upon the evaikiracion of the solvent these ions
recombine their electric charges then neutraliz ing each other so
that the molecule as a whole is not electrified there
is no immediate evi dence in a solution of the
existence within it of electrified particles or ions but if
an elec trical stress is excited across the solution by
imerting the electrodes of a galvanic battery at opposite sides
of the containing vessel the pos tively electrified ions are
urged one way and the negatively electrified ones the other
wa eventttall the ions thus urged along come in contact
with the electrodes themselves and here the iotis discharge their
electricities becoming thereby capable of existing in the free state
main and being in fact deposited upon the electrodes unless
prevented by some secondary action within the cell it will
be observed that electrical conduction through an electrolyte is eoiirelv
different according to the ionic theory from conduction throu solid
con ductors like metallic wires the ions in a solu
tion transport their charges bodily and pour them out upon
the electrodes the charge of an ion is supposed to
be perfectly definite in mag nitude and hence faradays law
that electro lytic aecomposition is accurately proportional to the total
quantity of electricity passing tkrougb the electrolyte is easilj understood
it mit be even better to slate it in the
iirverse form namely that the quantity of electricity corrveyed across
an electrolytic solution under a given electric stress is accurately
proportional to the total quantity of matter set free upon
the electrodes in a solution which does not con dnct
electricity the reason that it does not conduct is supposed
to be that the molecules of the solute are not
dissociated into ions to any iniportant extent so that they
are incapable of being electrically charged and are therefore in
ospame of acting as conveyors of electricity jlside cxatnple may
ht given of the appli cation of the molecular dieory
of solutions to the explanation of chemical equilibrium and mass
action suppose that m grammo lecnles of ethyl alcohol one

mixed and the solution is allowed to stand indefinitely the
acetic acid hcthioi combines with the alcohol chioh to form
ethyl acetate ch5cho and water hrf in accordance with the

that seveiral days elapse before a state of approximate equilibrium
is attained and even then the solution will contain free
acetic acid and free alcohol the amounts of these that
remain uncomhined depending upon the relative quantities of the several
constitik ents that were present in the original solution that
is upon m and tt it is this dependence upon
the relative quantities of the reacting sub stances that is
understood when we speak of the effect of mass in
chemical reactions or more briefly of mass action suppose now
that after a certain time there have been x gram
molecules of ethyl acetate formed in the course of the
reaction this implies that there have also been grammolecules of
water formed at the same time and x grammolecules each

of ethyl acetate x and of water tl the number
of actual molecules of alcohol and of acetic acid present
in the solu tion af this time will therefore be
proportional to and to 1 j respectively and hence the
number of chance encounters during one second between a molecule
or acetic add and one of alcohol will be proportional
to the prod uct of these quantities or to m
x we may assume that the number of actual com
binations taking place under these circum stances will be proportional
to this number of encounters and to a certain as
yet unknown coefiicient of affinity between the two sub stances
which coefficient we will denote by t the total number
of grammolecules of ethyl acetate formed during the next following
sec ond may therefore be taken as kmx 1 x
now if we had started our experiment bv mixing ethyl
acetate with pure water we snould have found that the
water and the ethyl acetate would combine to form alcohol
and free acetic acid as indicated by reading the foregoing
chemical equation from right to left the reaction in that
case also proceeding only to a definite point and then
ceasing in the actual case we must conceive of both
of these reactions as going on simultaneously there being x
gram molecules of ethyl acetate pres ent at the proposed
instant and nfj gram molecules of water and the chemical
affinitj of water for ethyl acetate being supposed to be
measured by a new coefficient k we con clude by
a process of reasoning entirely anal ogous to that just
explained that in the next following second the number of
grammole cules of ethyl acetate that vrill be decomposed will
be f hxx when equilibrium is finally established so that
ethyl acetate is no longer formed or decomposed that is
when it is fonned and decomposed with eqna raiiiidiqr dgt
google solvay soma re hsve the equation km x 1
knxx by trying the experiment with known initial quantities of
acetic acid alcohol and water we could ascertain directly the
value of x which now represents the number of gram
molecules of ethyl acetate present when equilibrium is attained and
substitution in the foregoing equation would then give us the
ratio of k ta k that is it would give
us the ratio of the actual chemical affinities that are
involved in this reaction it has been found in this
way that if we make initially ml and i0 then
when equilibrium is attained the resulting value of x is
h substituting this for x and putting 1 for m
and for we easily find that ii4 with this value
of the ratio of k to k we may write
the foregoing equa tion in the form 3 44mnjr4th0 this
is a quadratic equation and in order to find the
final state of equilibrium for any pro portion of alcohol
and water to acetic acid in the original solution we
have merely to substitute for m and n their values
as given for the primi tive solution and then solve
for x the equa tion being a quadratic has two
roots but no trouble need be had on that account
since it is plain that we must accept that root
which would give x0 when we set nt0 the results
ob tained from this equation by calculation have been compared
with the direct results of ex eriment and the agreement
has been found to quite satisfactory many other similar prob
lems have also been worked out from theoretical principles and
the resuhs verified by direct obser vation and by the
introduction of the methods of the dilterentiat and integral calculus
it has even been found to be possible to follow
the course of such reactions from stage to stage so
that the composition of the solution can be known at
every instant and not merely for the state of final

vibration of vocal cnords and of a column of air
passing through the trachea or windpipe in birds however the
organ of voice is double and consists of an upper
and a tower larynx or syrinx the latter being the
organ in which the voice or song is actually produced
the upper larynx is partly bony and partly cartilaginous is
situated at the glottis or open ing of the trachea
into the mouth and is of much simpler structure than
the larynx of mammals lacking the vocal chords except in
the ostrich american vultures and a few other birds the
syrinx is always developed it presents great variety in size
form and disposition of parts its bony elements consist essentially
of modifi cations of the lower rings of the trachea
at the point of its bifurcation to form the bronchi
and may be tracheal alone or bronchial alone or combine
elements of both bronchi and trachea the structure of the
upper larjmx apart from experimental demonstration proves that it is
incompetent to produce the song and its chief office must
therefore be tube its characteristic nar membrane which is attached
to the upper part of the bony structure known as
the trans versale or pessulus which bounds the lower end
of the windpipe this semilunar membrane is in fact one
of the vocal chords but a pair of others are
formed from folds of the mucous membrane projecting into the
interior from the upper branchial rings and bounding the pair
of syringeal glottis later ally the great distinction existing between
die syrinx of singing and of nonsinging birds lies in
the mobility of these parts and the ar rangement of
the muscles in the true sing ing birds the latter
are numerous distinct and so attached as to produce the
tensions or lax ness of the vocal chords upon which
the variety of notes depends the song of birds like
the notes of most if not of all other animals
is in a minor key usually the range of songnotes
may he com prised within a single octave hul of
course these limits may be nnd frequently are greatly exceeded
the parrots with a great ranpe of icice and possessing
great vocal capabilities possess an inferior larynx which differs from
that of most other birds in being single in its
nature in he production of the peculiar shrill whistling of
parrots the gkittis is probably passive or silent the column
of air vibrating as in a flute where a vibration
is communicated by the air and traverses the elastic walls
of the tube nearly all singing birds belong to the
group oseinet and stand at the head of the class
in perfection of general organization while much has been written
in description of the songs of various species of birds
and literature teems with tributes to the ability of feathered
songsters and although many songs have been reduced lo words
and others written in music the philosophical side of the
subject has been much neglected and a thoroughly com prehensive
work is still a desideratum one fact stands out very
clearly namely that the vocal efforts of birds bear a
close relation to sextial exdtemcni with many birds true song
is confined to the period of mating and incuba tion
and is replaced by the ordinary calls of alarm etc
very soon after the young have hatched in almost all
it reaches its highest ex pression during that period and
its effect is then heightened by vanous accompaniments of gesture
peculiar modes of flit etc among trwe songbirds great vocal
powers are almost confined o the males and are generally
sup posed to be the expression of greater vitality or
to have resulted through selection by the females for their
partners of those most gifted a view which is gaining
ground among zoolo gists is that the distinctive songs of
birds are mimetic in origin and some consider that inrd
language like human langfuage is not heredi tary but is
learned anew from their parents by the young of each
generation given an original exclamatory power of expression this has
been given direction and augmented by the imitation of the
various sounds of inanimate and animate nature by which various
speciet of birds were surrounded in their particular environment just
as the same elemental in fluences have been invoked to
explain the origin of human language in sexual selection in
the pleasure derived by a bird from its own mtic
and in the needs for fuller power of expression are
supposed to lie the forces effective in its ftirlher development

hiawatha the ltthe song of hiawatha which longfellow pub lished
in 1855 is the most notable of the many responses
to ae demand very strong during the first half of
the 19th century that the myths and legends of the
aborigines be made into a truly american poem characteristically he
took his measure from a european epic the finnish kalevata
but the substance was from actual indian traditions as longfellow
found them in such writers as catlin heckewelder and especially
schoolcraft whose algic re searches 1839 contains an interesting prose
version of much of longfellows material hie scene of the
poem is the southern shore of lake superior among the
ojibways the ac tion concerns itself with the life of
a famous iendary prophet called manabozho by the ojibwasrs and
by the iroquois hiawatha he makes rivers who was said
to have taught his people the beneficent arts of peace
such a personage was of course more congenial to longfellow
than a mere fighter would have been hiawatha chough strong
and valiant fights only against the dangerous forces of nature
he clears the river channels finds out how to cultivate
maize invents picturewriting be is a gentleman and a true
lover longfellow therefore had good reasons for selectmg the render
elements of indian life and thought for his narrative and
it is partly beside the mark to say that hiawatha
lacks its proper meas ure of savagery realistic its setting
and per sonages are not but the naive indian legends
appealing in their barest form have been kept fresh by
longfellows tender sympathy and clear and cheerful though somewhat facile
style fenimorc cooper had given the indian once for all
his reputation as a crafty warrior longfellow added primitive goodness
and rc lion to the perennial attributes of the in
dian of romance cahl van doren song of myself the
poem in which the american author walt whitman chose to
give an account of himself and his theory of poetij
art the substance of the poem forms in a remarkable
way whitmans apologia and to it everyone must go who
wishes to formulate anything like a correct estimate of the
man and of his literary aims it was first published
in 1855 without a title in 1856 as ltwah whit
man an american as wall whitman in i860 and until
1881 when the present title was adopted in its final
form for like everything of the authors it was carefully
revised the song of myself consists of some 52 divisions
of unequal length and of no close or formal connection
between parts the unity of the work resulting from the
tact that every part reveals some point of view some
halfrealiied emo tion some reflection or some vision of the
writer one is tempted to say of it by way
of criticism that it is walt whitmanish through and throu
it reveals to some degree every one of whitmans characteristics
the poem shifts at irregular intervals and in surprising ways
from the cheapest slang to passage il i lean and
loaf at my ease observing a spear of summer grass
the contemplation of the grass awakens whitmans wonder and forthwith
he sets out on a contemplative jour ney that takes
in the whole round of creation every part and feature
of which he pronounces good rich appleblossomd earth he exult
ingly cries smile for your lover comes he tells us
that as a poet he is only a mouthpiece his
thoughts are the thoughts of al men in all ages
and lands they are not original if he continues they
are not yours as much as mine they are nothing
or next to nothing in consequence he feels that through
him there speak many long dumb voices many forbid den
voices voices veiled voices indecent at this point we begin
to realize what whit man was actually trying to do
and in the light of this apologia we come to
understand that he is far more than he merely indecent
poet that so many people woula have us believe him
to be it takes a great poet to be the
mouthpiece of all whitman may not have been great enough
to compass the task fully but his efforts are not
to be made light of whatever else wc may do
we must reckon with him we shall not reckon with
him aright until we have first got thoroughly at the
heart of this song of myself to he sure thercmay
be in it much that is selfcontradictory we must remember
that whitman is afoot with his vision now and then
from his moun tain heights he strikes out such a
great psalm as thai immense have been the preparations for
me which comes to his lips when he turns on
the apex of the apices of the stairs and looks
past the phantoms which rise after rise bow behind him
until he sees afar down the huge first nothing from
which he took his origin d google 956 song of

in the more universal character of their appeal the songs

poesia popolare 1878 as ihe re sult of his investigations
believes that it was developed by a combination of two
popular stanzas the strambotio of eight verses with a rimingscheme
a b o b etc and the rispetto of lix
verses with a scheme c d c d etc cesareo
a huer student ltla poesia siciliana 1894 vw w 17
modifies this view by making the combination one of strambotti
the one of eight verses the other of six tile
beginnings of the sonnet appear to date from the early
13th century it quickly attained popularity and v hen decasyllabic
measure the length of the s net being sometimes thus
doubled or verses might be appended constituting a coda or
oouda the simpler arrangement however prevailed at the same time
as to the riming scheme in the octave or portion
of eight verses the arrangement abb aab ba replaced that
of a b a h etc while in the sestet
or portion of six verses it might be c de

the sonnet was firmly established on this new basis by
francesco petrarca petrarch and this form has since been gen
erally known as the petrarchan boscan intro duced the sonnet

arst great maker of sonnets though it is maintained that
this form of poetics was first introduced by metlin de

type is ababafialiaabc c the sheakespearean is distinguished in another
way from the petrarchan for while the latter formally sepa
rated the octave and sestet the former coirid not properly
be said to have such a division the arrangement being

measure is the one generally used allhou the octosyllabic is

standard deviations as in the case of s t coleridge
qv are called irregular sonnets or quatorzains or in charles

the miltonic structure in the petrarchan sonnet milton blending octave

sonnets on the italian model written by elizabeth barrett browning
elizabeth barrett as she then was known to her fellowpoet
and future hus band robert browning aside from their nobility
of thought and diction they are note worthy for their
bearing upon a great love story that is unique in
literary history because she falsely believed herself a hope less
invalid and because of the certainty of rental objection miss
barrett had rejected brownings offers of marriage until his ardor
by her during their secret betrothal reveal her doubts her
feeung of unworthiness her gradual jielding her exaltation in a
great and wonder ful love it was several months after
their romantic marriage that she placed the manu script in
her husbands hands browning who declared dared not reserve to
myself the finest sonnets written in any language since shakespeares
with difficulty persuaded her to fve them to the world
the name sonnets rom the portuguese invented by him to
veil the true origin was adopted partly because it suggested
the love of calarina and the portu guese poet camdens
and partly because my little portuguese was a pet name
that brown ing gave his wife while others have not
gone so far in their ipraise as browning in his

various races of man the science constitutes the natural history
of science and philosophy from their earliest beginnings in the
observations of primitive trices and traces their development into the
s of civilized nations sophists the designation applied to cer
tain schools of philosophers in greece which occupied the transition
period between the older and ruder cosmical philosophies and the
more reiined subsequent systems which beginning with socrates plato and
aristotle were founded primarily on the study of the human
mind as the perceiving thinking reasoning and kiiowing subject in
the older systems the direct relation of mind to the
objective universe did not receive prominent attention the hypothesis of
a unity m the external variety was assumed without dispute
and a theistic or materialistic interpretation of this unity formulated
accord ing to the tendency of the school in this
man ner arose a succession of systems which were agreed
in being artificial cosmogonies unrelated if not hostile to the
current traditions of reli gion and however superior to these
current notions as the efforts of great minds to com
prehend the relations of things they were still unable to
stand the inevitable criticism of com parison with fact of
this comparison and criticism the sophists were the exponents and
iti force fell both on philosophy and relion but none
of the sophists were really great men at least in
comparison with those who succeeded them and they appeared in
an age of political decline and social corruption the direct
services of the sophists to phi losophy appear to have
been small and negative it is too much to attribute
to them as a merit the introduction of subjective philosophy
this as its simultaneous appearance in different schools proves was
no more than a necessity of the period to which
they belonged what chiefly marks the sophists was their incapacity
to generalize the subjective element in conse quence of which
they were not philosophers properly so called but only the
critics of a ddng philosophy bui the sophists rendered to
science and literature and even indirectly to philosophy much greater
services than as plu losophers they were able to render
to philoso phy they have been not inaptly compared to
the french encycloptedists they belonged to all the liberal professions
they taught all the usual branches of knowledge some of
them were distinguished as rhetoricians and gram marians others as
men of science they fre quently made a profession of
universal knowl edge and though from their overweening esti mate
of the newly found subjective element of knowledge they carried
this pretension so far as to profess to speak of
subjects of whch they knew nothing all thr prctenuons were
not equally frivolous rhetoric to which they naturally gave undue
importance was systemat ically studied by them and they supplied
some of the earliest models of good greek prose they
are accused however particularly the later sophists of being not
only superficial in their attainments but tnercenary vsinglorious and selfseeking
in their aims protagoras of abdera the earliest and one
of the most important of the sophists was con temporary
with socrates but considerably older he applied the heraclitan doctrine
of the uni versal finx of all things to the
mind maintained the uncertainty of the existence of the gods
and the relativity of all truth man he said is
the measure of all things that is true for the
individual which for the time being he per ceives or
feels sense and the ratihcation of sense are the only
relations which subsist be tween man and the external world
all opinions are equally true and contradictories may be affirmed
with equal authority protagoras is said to have been the
first who taught for pay and though he left his
pupils to fix his re muneration according to the amount
of benefit they had received he is said to have
become wealthy gorgias of leonlini came to athens in 427

be known that if it could be known it could
not be communicated gorgias reaches tliese conclusions by a logical
quibble in which he pjays off heraeliius against the eleatic
school the scepticism of gorgias however like that of other
sophists as it was founded on a superficial logic was

was a man of middle rank and owner of many

a good educa n all the poet wrote music was
not neglected in diis branch the young sophocles was trained

and won prizes in gymnastic and athletic contests his beauty
and natural grace were exceptional at the age of 15
he was chosen to lead the chorus that san the

the poets relation to the great philosophers we know nothing
but we may be reasonably sure from theintemal evidence of
his works that his mind was not eager to pry
into the unknown with voltaire he might have said adorons
dieu sans vouloir percer ses mysteres sophocles was bom when
athens was be ginning to rise toward the zenith of
her glory and he died in his 90th year just
before her brilliant sun had set he lived to witness
the passing success of athenian arms at arginuse but died
before her star was obscured by the cloud of gospotami
it was the century of gmon and pericles of phidias
and ictinus greece was the centre of the world athens
the hearthstone of hellas the home of art literature science
but amid all this unrest opportum and glory sophocles lived
a ufe of imperturbable pi act titty calm and self
possessed he dedicated his life to his art as browning
has welt said his evenbalanced soul business could not make
dull nor passion wild only one cloud cast a momentary
shadow over his long and serene lif e bis son
lophon arraigned him before his deme as incapable of managing
property the old man refuted the charge by reciting the
ode he had just com posed on his native colonus
for public affairs the poet showed no great aptitude pericles
did not have a very high opinion of his strategic
abilities and the great statesman had an excellent opportunity of
judging for sophocles was elected to serve with him as
a general to conduct the samian war the ap pointment
we are told was due to the suc cess of
his antigone later he became a colleague of nicias he
was also a minor priest and one of the treasurers
that managed the tribute paid to athens by her allies
the poet met herodotus and composed an ode in honor
of the historian sophocles was probably also acquainted with a
great many other dis tinguished men there is a wealth
of ideas a sprightly grace and a delicacy of views
in his works that could not have developed in any
other atmosphere after the sidtian rer verse he was elected
a member of the college of six magistrates created to
propose measures of safety in 411 he was appointed on
a com mittee of 30 to modify the constitution but
he was conservative in politics and withdrew from all participation
in their work when they pro posed to rule without
consulting the general assembly with his first tetralogy sophocles competed
with schylus for the tragic prize and won 468 although
he was on5 28 years of age we are told
tnat when the archon was hesitat ing to draw lots
gmon who had just returned from his conquest of scyrus
entered the theatre and proceeded to pour out a libation
to dionysus whereupon he and his fellowgen erals were detained
to act as judges hence forth sophocles was master of
the stage he produced on an average one tetralogy every
two years no other tragic poet ever securm a greater
number of prizes metimes in the earlier days he took
the leading part himself he not only played acceptably the
title role of nausicaa but he also distinguished himself by
his grace in dancing cschylus died in distant sicily euripides
mid the wilds of macedonia but sophocles though invited by
foreign potentates to their splendid courts lived and died in
the city of his birth sophocles man ners were affable
and pleasing his conversa tion was full of that socratic
irony which we find so charming in the dialogues of
plato endowed with a serene composure of manner and gifted
with gentleness beauty and intellect snull wonder that his contemporaries
believed that the poet was beloved by the gods after
death the athenians worshipped him as a hero to the
whole greek world he was known as the attic bee
but in the natural sweetness oi his temper there was
something bitter a tang which produced the flavor it was
his charm and grace that commended sophocles especially to the
greeks he was a more perfect artist than schylus and
euripides the periclean age showed a decided preference for him
over the other two in the eyes of the athenians
sophocles was next to homer unsurpassed in wit sweetness discourse
art sophocles found the artform already developed bui he tempered
the tone of tragedy the material of which he narrowed
to the compass of a single play there is no
nexus between the parts of liis triltogies in sophocles too
the characterization becomes sharper and the diakigue moves more briskly
the action be comes more complicated the meshes of intrigue
finer there is also a marked difference between sophocles and
jschy1us in the space devoted to the chorus the lyric
simply reflects no longer bears the iece though it is
still an integral part of the action but the plot
is developed with consummate skill and with the most exact
d google 80ph0clbs sokbon thougftlfulness the plot of ltedipus rexgt
is so subtly articulated that each episode each period each
verse becomes an indispensable part of the whole not even
edgar allan poe strove more eamestty for totality o effect
it is this articulation that makes conspicuous the irony that
runs through sophocles but it is particularly in the portrayal
of character that sophocles is in advance of schylus the
latter evokes fear euripides pity sophocles both and in due
proportion the plot assists in the development of the character
the poets theme is man his heroes are ideal but
they show genuinely human traits the ds are kept in
the background as in jschylus tht control the action but
from a point so hign above our horizon that we
are not conscious of their domination until we reach the
dinoue menl sophocles was not only a dramatist he was
also a poet in all greek poetry there is a
strong current of feeling for external nature but in sophocles
this feeling is always ex quisitely adapted to dramatic eltect
many innovations were made by sophocles he increased the number
in the chorus from 12 to 15 developed the parados
introduced a third actor and made great use of stage
scenery sophocles has his inevitable per fection but ne is
not uniform enough to be faultily faultless his poetry is
never jejune but succulent full of sap and marrow and
he is the one consummate master of style melody vocabulary
and versification the one poet that always maintains a noble
homeric grace that never sinks below the cahn level of
high art his style is vigorous but it is also
marvelously subtle no poet better combines severity with variety and
sweetness with vigor in his rhythmic measures he always adapts
rhythm to expression his choral songs are con structed with
the skill of a master arciiitect of the hundred and

can find no principle of explanation that is not at
once a tangible ob ject and the bearer of human

view of the savage to that of the uneducated man
in a civilized community consists at most in the discardance
of the grosser material at tributes of the soul without
the loss of any of its anthropomorphic qualities it requires
a certain degree of philosophical sophistica tion to become aware
that any explanation of the soul which is to convey
real knowledge must not involve the equally complicated notion of
a person the first explanations of the soul which are
to be found in greek philosophy resemble nil the explanations
of their period in that they d google make use

ihat of anaximenes fire in tnat of keraclitus and he
finer atoms among the atomisls is considered to be a
moving force anaxagoras made the first greal ad vance in
the theory of the soul by isolating the notion of
moving force from that of a particnlar material substance the
pythagore ans adopted a view which may be regarded as
an antiapation of aristotle in that they held the soul
to be the harmony of the body in this presocratic
period all the accounts of the sou place a preponderant
emphasis on its cog it is only with plato that
the nature of the soul comes to be the cardinal
problem of philos ophy he assigns to it a place
intermediate between notbeing and the realm of ideas the worldsout
is the harmony of sameness that is universality such as
pertains to the ideas and otherness or the particularity character
istic of the things of sense the soul of the
individual is a less perfect copy of the soul of
the universe the soul is immortal and un created and
the universals of our knowledge arc but the recollection of
what we have learned in a previous life the soul
cannot be de stroyed for it partakes in the idea
of life it self the body is the prison of
the soul and prevents it from returning to its home
in the realm of ideas each soul contains three parts
a desiderative a spirited and a rational that soul in
which the rational preponderates will resume that life of which
all souls origi nally partook the blessed kfe of a
star the aristotelian view of the sou is pecul iarly
interesting in that it involves motives which are active in
the philosophy of the pres ent day he places the
soul definitely in that eatory of being corresponding to the
platonic ideas the realm of pure forms the soul is
the formal canse ot the human body and since the
body is an organism the soul is also the final
and eftident cause in aristotles own language the soul is
the entelechy of the body like the platonic soul the
aristotelian soul is tripartite it contains a vegetative part which
superintends the functions of assimilation and propagation and constitutes the
entire soul of plants an animal soul characterized by the
powers of locomotion and sensation which sup plements the vegetative
soul throughout the animal idngdom and a rational soul found
only in man the principle of unity connect ing these
three facuhties is not explained ttie question of the oneness
of personality is com riicated by the notion of the
soul as an immate rial principle aristotle denies immortality to
the soul which he conceives to be created like the
body in the act of begetting the stoic psychology is
essentially mate rialistic the soul is nothing but fire or
breath uniting the body much as the worldsoul of fire
unites the world the soul consists of reason the power
of reproduction speech and the five senses personal identity resides
in the reason but the individual soul is a part
of the worldsoul the sou exists after death though not
for an eternity epicureanism took over bodily the psychological theory
of atom ism the soul according to the epicureans is
made up of the finest firelike atoms the movements of
which are sensation and thouft immortality is completely denied lucretius
distinguishes two levels of psychical life the lower animal anitna
and ifie higher animus presiding over emotion and cognition the
neoplatonists consider intelligence soul and matter as successive emanations from
the one soul is consequently prior to body and more
real than it this opinion is in the philosophy of
the gnostics combined with the tripartite division of human nature
characteristic of the older platonism in place of the desiderative
part of man according to the platonic philos ophy they
put the body in place of the spirited part the
soul in place of the intellectual part religious t is
no longer given to reason out to tnat new element
which enters into the human soul upon conversion in the
later christian philosophy the soul and spirit are fused into
a single entity in saint augustine there are found many
of the motives which characterize later mediaeval and modern philosophy
the body soul dualism based on the distinction between thought
and extension appears in his philosophy as well as in
that of descartes he retains the aristotelian notion of the
soul as final cause and disclaims all knowledge of the
origin of the soul the scholastic doctrine of the soul
is essen tially aristotelian in the form held by saint
thomas and now the official philosophy of the catholic church
it consists of the following dogmas 1 the soul which
is not divided after the fashion indicated by aristotle is
the form of the body 2 it is a substance
but is incomplete in the sense that it has a
natural fitness for association with a body 3 it is
spiritual and without extension 4 it is created at a
definite moment in the develop ment of the organism of
course the scholas tics all maintained the immortality of the
soul the modern period of philosojical thought is marked by
a very important change in the notion of the soul
as has been shown the scholastic philosophy perpetuated the aristotel
ian concept of the soul as form or entelechy while
it is true that the scholastics regarded the soul as
a substance they considered it not as merely coequal with
matter but as the ornizing factor m the soulmatter complex
which constitutes man the body was thus in a sense
subordinated to the soul on the other hand in the
philosophy of descartes soul and body are coordinated as respectively
the thinking and the extended substances as a substance is
that which possesses attributes it is quite a different sort
of thing from the aristotelian form which gives to matter
its attributes the soul iubstance is of course differentiated into
individual souls but ot the nature of this differentiation descartes
says little or nothing the existence of my indi vidual
soul is aranteed to me by the famous principle i
think therefore i am after the cartesian dialectic has established
the existence of god and the material universe the next
problem is the correlation of the ex periencing soul and
the material objects of its experience this correlation which according
to descartes is guaranteed by the perfect hon esty of
god is supposed to take place in the pineal gland
the occasionatists go beyond jjj jjj make the correlation google
between the soul and the matter depend on the act
of god in each particular case the cul mination of
thij trend of thought is to be found in spinoza
who maintains that mind and mat ter are not separate
substances at all but merely two amon the infinite number
of at tributes of the divine substance another off shoot
of occasionahsm is the philosophy of ldbnitz instead of a
dualism of mind and matter his philosophy is a pluralism
of differ ent soulsub stances which in contused per ception
may give the appearance of matter tlic correlation between the
content of an indi vidual soul and the universe which
this content represents is established through an act of god
which has preestablished the harmony of the universe unlike the
continuous divine inter vention of occasionalism this act was finished
once for all at the creation of the universe the
rationalistic school of the continent as has been shown ended
so far as the concept of the soul is essentially
substance and spinoza it is a divine attribute possessing much
of the autonomy of a cartesian sub stance like the
rationalists the british em piricists began with a substantial notion
of the soul but unlike the rationalists they car ried
the notion to its absurd lofcal conclusion and transcended it
locke considered the soul after the fashion of descartes as
a substance as the substratum of ideas he made it
a blank tablet on which the ideas are impressed but
beyond this he did not characterize it though he was
sure that self consciousness exists he made no psychological investigation
into its nature berkeley for all his incisive criticism of
the lockeietn notion of substance in its application to the
material world left the notion of soul untouched it remained
for hume to do for mind what berkeley had done
for matter and to point out the fact that intro
spection alone was unable to reveal a specific soul entity
putting this fact side by side with the inabihly of
the notion of a substratum to give a real explanation
of anything he came to the conclusion that the mind
is neither more nor less than the sum total of
its states kant who was awakened by hume from his
dogmatic slumber was not the least under his influence in
the matter of the soul while he most emphatically asserts
that a soul ex ists he denies that il is
immediately accessible to perception he points out in the course
of his discussion of tne paralosms of rational subject which
must exist in some sense or other in every act
of consciousness and the simple lasting personal soui the soul
qua substance is inaccessible to us and the entire worth
of a dialectical discussion of psycho logical matters lies in
the criticism to which it sudjecis such theories of he
soul as material ism or the opinion that we have
a direct in tellectual acquaintance with a permanent per sonal
egp thus all metaphysical proof of immortatity falls to the
cround as likewise dors all metaphysical disproof the immortality of
the soul however is established as a postulate of the
pure practical reason of the reason as applied to affairs
of conduct the existence qi morality requires that there should
be a progress in infittilttm of the imperfect human will
toward the perfection enjoined by the moral law kants attitude
towards the soul may be summed up in the statement
that the soul can only be thought by the pure
reason but may be known by the practical reason this
ability of the practical reason to grasp matters that are
partly veiled to the pure rea son is known by
kant as the primacy of the practical reason the kantian
primacy of the practical reason is repeated in the philosophy
of the romanticists under the form of vojun tarism fichte
and schopenhauer both empha size the part played by the
will in the constitu tion of the soul the ego
which is the basis of the entire fichtean philosophy is
grasped in a voluntary act of intellectual intuition which exhibits
to us the law of duty the ego is immediately
aware of its own free act for schopenhauer as later
for bergson the intellect is but a schematization of the
will which con stitutes the true nature of the human
being as well as of the universe hegel agrees with
the kantian refutation of rational psychology but regards the icantian
antinomies constitutii kants refutation merely as a few of an
indefi nite number of antinomies having their roots in being
itself herbart makes the soul one of his undefined primitive
concepts it is simple absolute and transcends the bounds of
space and lime its only activity is self oreservation and
ideas arise when it acts to preserve itself in opposition
to another real lotze considers that the soul and body
inter act and that mind is but the higher explicit
development of what is found in the grossest matter the
philosophy of fechner is like wise a panpsychism cv which
makes the entire universe consist in a hierarchy of souls
subordinated to the worldsoul of god whose body is nature
among the more interesting of the cur rent views concerning
the nature of the soul is that which assimilates the
soul to the phe nomena of life in general while
this is the tendency of all vitalists it reaches the
high est degree of metaphysical development in the philosophy of
henri bergson bergsons phi losophy is based on the contrast
between two aspects of the universe between the immedi ately
given living time and the atomic siace known only through
the analvtic powers of the intelligence the temporal aspect of
the universe is identified with the spiritual force of life
accordingly the true nature of the self is inaccessible to
the formal deadening intellect and can be grasped only through
in tuition in this aspect as grasped by intuition it
transcends all individuation and personality it ils the same living
force which exemplifies it self throughout all nature only through
the damming of the stream of life by matter does
the individual soul arise with its concoi body empirical psychology
is of itself v to transcend the individual soul and
see uie greater reality that lies behind the bergsonian philosophy
that is points out the limitations of a rational account
of the soul and indicates a superrational mode of approach
psychology as bergsonianism treats of matters which it claims are
not properly subject to the reason it is clear that
it daims for itself an intuitive basis whether the bcrgsonian
intuition ex ists or not is a sheer question of
fact it is dgt google ccnain at any rale that
there are many who do not feel an intuitive ccxnpiilsion
to accept bergsons view of the soul at present there
is a strong tendency to re turn to what is
in a sense the hutnian view of the soul james
and the american school of neorealism see realism agree to
the extent that they consider the soul as the stream
of its states and maintain that these states in a
different context and arrangement form the subject matter of the
physical science this view similar as it is to that
of hume marks at once a great advance over ihat
of hume and a partial revival of aristotelian ism the
stream of slates is not a mere fortuitous aggregx of
experiences as experiences and bs experiences are each united in
a manner totally different from the manner in which some
of as experiences can be united to some of bs
in other words this theory which calls hself neutral monism
makes the soul consist not merely of certain states which
are aggreeated but of a system of statesinapecu liarmo deof
aggregation the distinction between these alternatives was inadmissible for hume
be cause of his nominalism on the other hand it
may be expressed in aristotelian languages by calling the mode
of aggregation the entel echy of the stream of states
like aristo tehanism neutral monism finds the unity of is
in the embodiment of a form or relation but unlike
aristotelian ntains that the matter shaped v this form is
not the body but the stream of consciousness itself neutral
monism has recently been subjected to a keen and unfavorable
criticism by bertrand russell his objections are 1 that introspec
tion shows that knowledge does not consist in the entry
of an experience into a system of experiences but in
a direct relation to a mind or soul 2 that
neutral monism cannot ac count for the relation of belief
3 that the thought of a timeless thing is in
time so that the uiing and the thongiit cannot differ
merely in their context 4 that neutral monism is adapted
to explain rather the knowledge of things than that of
facts 5 that there are emphatic particulars such as this
and and now it is possible however to modify neutral
monism so as to avoid much of the force of
these objections to begin with objection 3 it is not
essential for neutral monism to maintain that every experience is
identical with its object this much of nominalism is valid
that in much of our thinking the ultimate ob jects
are supplanted by their sbols there is nothing controverting the
principles of neu tral monism in the sttpposition that in
a certain context one experience datum may acquire a vicarious
interpretation as another see meaning thourht neither is it in
any wav impossible or unlikely that the timeless should be
presented to us directly putting these two possibihties together it
is clear that the thought of a timeless thing may
be in lime jtist by virtue of the act that
the situation in which the time less thing occurs is
symbolised by a complex of similar structure but consisting of
temporal entities belief is also explained by the self representative
character of experience a be lief is a situation where
a complex of ex periences plavs the part of a
symbol complex toward another complex with the of which it
has not been definitely compared as to neutral monism and
the knowledge of facts there is no reason why experience
should not contain factstates as well as thingstates immediate acquaintance
with facts offers no difficulties while descriptive knowledge is merely
such knowledge as is mediated by a symbolism the objection
that introspection conflicts with neutral monism is certainly not conclusive
as introspection is no more infallible than other varieties of
observation the rus sell ian resolution of a table into
an aggregate of aspects or empirical data calls for a
puilo nopbical sophistication which should not be ap behind it

britain and the south african republic transvaal and the orange
free state a considerable body of the dutch population of
south africa has never been leconciled to the rule of
the british and rea sonable grounds for discontent have not
been wanting see boebs the settlement agreed to by gladstones
government in is81 after majuba hill qv followed in a
modified form by that of 1884 was generally looked upon
by the boers of the transvaal as a triumph for
ihem majuba day was annually celebrated as commemorating a great
event in heir history and this tended to keep alive
a spirit of hostility to great britain and perhaps lo
foster thoughts of a greater triumph that might be attained
in the future the wars with the natives continued even
after 1884 had made the boers on the whole a
military people and about 1893 president kruger qv began to
increase the transvaal armaments seeing that nothing but force could
ultimately keep the uitlanders the nonboer settlers in the trans
vaal especially in johannesburg qv from gaining political rights and
that force would also be necessary to enable him to
get rid en tirely of british suzerainty and to secure
what he had long desired free access lo the coast
the jameson raid see jameson sir leandegt starr an illadvised
attempt made at the close of 1895 bv a handful
of british subjects who invaded toe transvaal with a view
to gainii some advantage for the uitlanders furnished ground for
increasing the warlike equipments of the country and the gold
mines of the rand see witwatershand supplied the funds which
were spent on rifles artillery ammuni tion etc all of
the newest and best types these funds had to be
provided in great part by the uitlanders who though they
bore the bulk of the taxation and owned a great
share of the property in the transvaal were excluded from
an share in the government and were treated in a
harsh and domineering spirit early in 1899 a numerously signed
petition from british residents in the transvaal was forwarded by
sir alfred now lord milner qv the hi commissioner to
the home gov ernment setting forth the grievances of the
petitioners and declaring their position to have become intolerable it
was then arranged on the invitation of president steyn qv
of life orange free state that matters should be dis
cussed between the high commissioner and president kruger at the
free state capital bloemfontein the parlies held meetings from 31
may to 5 june but no agreement was reached president
kruger now submitted to the transvaal volksraad a franchise scheme
of his own professedly meeting all legitimale or reasonable claims
of the uitlanders to this many of his friends gave
their approval though sir a milner thought it came far
short of what was required then followed more negotiations which
sometimes seemed to give hope of a satisfactory result but
apart from the franchise question the claim of the south
african republic lo the status of a perfectly independent state
still barred the way to a settlement meantime the war
spirit was ris ing in the transvaal on 8 september
the bnttsh cabinet decided to raise the garrison in south
africa to a strength suffiaent to protect the colonies on
9 october the south african republic presented an ultimatum delivered
to the british agent in the transvaal for answer within
48 hours demanded that all matters in dispute should be
settled by arbitration or in some other way to be
agreed on that all troops on the borders of the
republic should be in stantly withdrawn hat reinforcements whidi had
arrived in south africa since 1 june should be removed
from south africa within a rea sonable time and that
the troops then on their way lo south africa should
not be landed war ai once followed the oran free

digitized 6 google south african wak 877 the war was
actually begun by the boers invading natal and cape colony
lady smith in che former and kimberley and mafe king
in the laiier being the places in which the greatest
interest was almost immediately cen tred at the beginning of
the struggle the british regular troops in south africa did
not greallv exceed 22000 in number about half of them
being in natal under the command of sir george white
who had his headquarters at ladysmith on 20 october the
boers who had invaded northern natal endeavored to cut off
the british camp near dundee where general symons was stationed
with about 5000 men lliey were rcpiilsed at talara hill
but the british general was mortally wounded and the following
day they were more severely de feated at elandslaagce by
general f ranchs force from ladysmitn it was necessary how
ever to withdraw the northern garrison to ladysmith and this
was done after the boers had been beaten off by
general white at riet fontein the boers were now in
such force that with general joubert as commanderin chief ladysmith
was soon completely invested the railway from the south being
seized as well as the bridge over the tugela at
colenso sev eral naval gwns had been brought into ladysmith
before this which enabled its defenders to reply to the
powerful artillery which the boers had planted on the neighboring
heists swarm ing down into natal the invaders overran the
country as far as the mooi river and beyond and
il appeared that they might even attack maritzburg but the
first army corps of 54000 men reached south africa in
november and gen sir redvers buuer who had arrived to
take supreme command took under his charge a large portion
of this force and so was able to drive the
boers back and prepare for the rehef of ladysmith other
divisions of the reinforcements were dispatched inland from cape town
port elizabeth and east london to aid in checking the
boer advance into cape colony and to open the way
to kimberley the force which undertook the latter task was
under the command of lord methuen while general galacre was
to operate atnst the boers in the stormberg district of
the cape colony french being in command of a british
force between the two advancing northward methuen assumed the offensive
drove the boers from a strong position at belmont de
feated them two days after at enslin and on 28
november dislodged them from a strong position at the modder
river which was crossed without opposition then followed a series
of reverses to the british troops which cast a gloom
over the whole empire on 10 december gatacre attempted a
night attack on a body of boers strongly posted near
stormberg but after a toilsome night march his men unexpectedly
came upon the enemys posi tion which they were unable
to capture and were driven back with heavy loss on
the same day general methuen had shelled the boers previously
to attackiiig their position at magersfontein where as at many
places after ward the boer general de la rey qv
dis tinguished himself early next morning while mardiing to the
attack in quarter column and on the point of deploying
the highland brigade tmexpectedly found itself exposed to a close
fire from the boer trenches atid lost very heavily the
commanding officer general wau chope being killed the third and
most seri ous reverse took place in natal on 15
decem ber general buuer attempted by what has been generally
regarded as an illjudged plan to force his way across
the tugela at colenso with the view of relieving ladysmith
this great mistake consisted in attacking two days earlier than
arranged for with white who re mained inactive in ladysmith
without knowing what was going on outside it has not
been ex plained why builer did not advise white of
the change in his plans notwithstanding a display of admirable
courage on the side of tne british and certain partial
successes the plan as a whole entirelj failed the failure
being aggravated by casualties in killed wounded and missing amounting
to over 1100 while 10 superior guns were abandoned to
the boers the only son of lord roberts qv tell
at colenso on receiving the news of general bullers repulse
the cabinet decided to send out imme diately the seventh
army division already being mobilized to call up the remaiigtder
of the army reserve to incorporate a new yeomanry force
to allow 12 battahons of militia to volunteer for service
abroad to employ volunteers on active service and to accept
offers of help made by the great colonies lord roberts
was in structed to proceed to south africa as com
manderinchief with lord kitchener as chief of his staff and
col hector macdonald was appointed to succeed general wauchope in
command of the highland brigade when the year 1900 opened
the troops hemmed in at ladysmith igmberley and mafe king
were holding their own but at the first place enteric
fever had begun to make serious ravages and to cause
much anxiety in the cape colony methuen was confronted by
gen eral cronje in a strongly intrenched position and gatacre
after falling back from stormberg was holding sterkstroom french in
the coles berg district was more actively employed and succeeded
in defeating die boers in several im portant actions lord
roberts arid his stafif arrived at cape town on 10
january but before anything could be done by the new
commander inchief buuer made another attempt against the boer position
at colenso 11 january with this unsuccessful movement is associated
the name of spion kop an eminence in the scene
of action the seizure and temporary oc cupation of which
cost many bridsh lives to no purpose yet a third
attempt was made to break through to ladysmith s february
vaal krantz being a sition which figured most prominently on
this occasion but again the result was only disappointment to
the be sieged force more especially meanwhile rooerts had been
making plans for more ef fectively dealing with the enemy
and had col lected a strong cavalry force under french
between the orange river and the modder while the attention
of the boers under cronje was drawn off by a
movement carried out w macdonald and the highland brigade french
advanced rapidly on kimberley and in spite of all opposition
reached the place dispersed the investing troops and entered the
town 16 february cronje at magersfontein had now allowed himself
to get into a difficult position not fully realizing die
strength and intentions of the british and though he tried
to escape d google south african was eastward toward bloemfontein
it was too late he was brought to a halt
at paardeberg took refuge in the bed of the modder
where he managed to hold out for a week but
being completely hemmed in and an attempt at his rescue
by general de wet being defeated he surrendered to roberts
with over 4000 men this was on 27 february the
anniversary of majnba hill cronje and the rest of the
prisoners were sent to saint helena mean while fresh efforts
were being made by buller for ihe relief ot ladysmith
and this time with success after a series of difficult
operations the boer left was finally turned and on 28
february lord dundonald rode into ladysmith being followed by buller
two days iater the garrison was found to be in
sore straits for want of food and had suffered severely
from disease as well as from the attacks by which
they had been harassed one of the fiercest of these
had been made on 6 januarv when the boers had
endeavored to take the town by storm but were repulsed
with heavy loss on this occasion a position known as
wagon hill had been three times captured and recaptured in
the course ot the day gen ian hamiltotr qy here
greatly distinguishing himself it hasbeen said that the successful defense
of ladysmith was from a military point of view the
mpst valuable achievement of the war inas much as the
loss of a garrison of 12xx men would have been
a braver disaster than any conceivable defeat in hie open
field and more over the fall of ladysmith was to
be the simal for the general rising of the dutch
in the cape colony and natal following on the successes
in the west of the orange free state came successful
operations by the generals in the northern parts of cape
colony gatacre clements and brabant bloemfontein now be came roberts
objective and after joubert had vainly attempted to bar his
way at poplar grove and again at driefontein the british
commander entered the capital of he orange free state practically
without opposition 13 march kruger and steyn hed to the
north the keys of the town were surrendered to lord
roberts and the railways being soon re paired through communication
was opened be tween bloemfontein and cape town the orange
free state was proclaimed british ter ritonr there was a
long halt at bloemfontein and during this period enteric fever
proved a ter rible scourge to the british and the
boers were encouragea to fresh activity several mishaps now befell
different bodies of british troops and de wet proved himself
a leader of excep tional ability on the boer side
while louis botha qv also gained distinction for himself having
succeeded to the chief command on the death of joubert
27 march the advance northward from bloemfontein began on 3
may the british forces under gens ian hamilton french and
pole carew with lord roberts at their head often showed
a front of 40 miles and thou the enemy repeatedly
seemed to threaten a determined stand no efteclive re sistance
was encountered either on the vaal or elsewhere one after
another the boer posi tions were turned bothas troops hed
in con fusion from johannesburg where the british flag was
hoisted on 31 may and pretoria the transvaal cahtal was
occuiued on 5 june no attempt being made by the
boers to hold the forts general botha and a considerable
body of men retired eastward along he railway in the
direction of komati poort near the portu guese frontier in
which direction president kruger mr reitz and other members of
the transvaal government had preceded him the boers were followed
and beaten at pienaars poort arbout 15 miles from pretoria
mean while butler had been advancing northward through natal and
had entered the transvaal from that side driving the boers
before him on 15 may dundee and glencoe y tance
of majuba and laings nek which v strongly held by
the enemy but by a skilful turning movement genera hildyard
secured command of the boer positions which were at once
evacuated bullers force had marched 50 miles in six days
and had defeated the boers in four engagements his troops
were thus put in a position to cooperate with the
main army under lord roberts and early in july the
rail way to pretoria from durban was open the number
of british troops in south africa by the middle of
the year was about 250000 shortly after the middle of
may 1900 news reached england that the boers had been
driven from mafekin and that the town had been entered
by a british force from the south the place had
been invested from 15 october when cronje with a force
of some 9000 men had marched to the aitack it
was well sup plied with stores and this together with
the indomitable energy and fertility of resource shown by majorgeneral
badenpowell who commanded the small garrison enabled it to hold
out against all attempts to capture it a last attempt
to lake it had been made on 13 may by
commandant eloff a grandson of president kruger this not only
failed but the leader and a number of his men
were themselves taken prisoners in the end of july an
important success was gained in the orange free state now
called oranife river colony by general hunter with the aid
of generals rundle clement bruce hamikon paget and macdonald as
the result of a conybined movement a force of some
4ci0o boers under prinsloo was surrounded by the british troops
and forced to surrender with guns horses and wagons the
burghers being sent as prisoners to ceylon de wet witn
2tx0men escaped as on various subsequent advancing eastward from the
pretoria dis inct roberts joined bands with buller and from
bis headquarters at belfast issued a proc lamation annexing the
transvaal to the british dominions 1 september previous to this
buller had forced the boers from a strong position they
had taken up near machadodorp and had thus effected the
release of a large number of prisoners whom they had
taken with them from pretoria on ii september president kruger
took refuge in portuguese territory and many of his compatriots
followed his example or scattered in different directions having previously
de stroyed many of their guns with vast quantities of
ammunition and stores lord roberts re ported that there was
nothing left of the boer amies but a few marauding
bands but this d google south african war ard view
of the case proved premature on 6 october buller left
ihe army tor england on the 20th president kruger sailed
for europe on board a dutch manofwar lord roberts left
for home before the end of the year hand ing
over the chief command to lord kitchener the war had
now entered upon what might be called the guerrilla stage
during which the activity and daring of such leaders on
the boer side as botha and de wet gave plenty
of hard work to the british troops looking with con
fidence for support from their kinsmen in the cape colony
and natal and still hoping for the intervention of some
european power the boer leaders planned two enterprises which they
thought might yet retrieve tneir cause botha with some 6000
men was to make a sudden dash into natai and
raid the country if pos sible all ihe way down
to durban while de direction of cape town these attempts
were made in the early part of 1901 bothas plan
was completely frustrated by a kreat sweeping movement of general
french the boers were dispersed with the loss of guns
wagons and immense numbers of cattle and sheep de wet
fared no belter bul like botha he himself es caped
capture though losing guns ammuni and wagons marauding bands that
had longed to his force managed however 1o enicr the
cape colony and for a time gave much tnvible aided
and encouraged as they were by their dutch friends to
checlcmate the boer rteoi of warfare kitchener resolved to clear
country of food and cattle so as to deprive the
boers of supplies to protect ihe railways by chains of
blocknouses to carry similar chains across the country in suitable
lthrectlons and to keep the boers perpetually on the move
by mobile columns of british troops kitcheners measures which were
found exceedingly effect ive in ihe long rvn included the
gathering to gether of great multitudes of boer women and
children into the socalled concentration camps a measure widely discussed
and much con demned in the press of neutral countries
a discussion regarding terms of peace took place between lord
kitchener and general botha on 28 march 1901 but nothing
came of it ihe gradual wearing down of the boers
went on ana by the end oi may they had
lost prac tically all heir artillery apart from guns buried
in the earth on 12 july the free state government
and some imporiant papers were captured at reitz and president
sleyn himself made a narrow escape on 7 august kitchener
issued a proclamation calling for the surrender of the boers
by 15 september on pain of the perpetual banishment of
the leaders and of the property of the others being
charged with the cost of maintenance of their faimues in
british hands the transvaal and free state leaders had been
uscussing the advisa bility of giving in but president kruger
from europe urged them to continue fighting until their independence
was secured renewed ac tivity on the pan of botha
de wet and other boer leaders followedj and the british
met with one or two rather serious mishaps by the
end of the year 1901 there had been put out
of action some 53000 boers of whom 40000 were in
concentration camps or were kept in custody in saini helena
ceylon india bermuda or elsewhere after some great drives organ
ized by kitchener and carried out in the early part
of 1902 whidi resulted in the surrender of many burghers
and which owed their suc cess largely to the blockhouse
system nego tiations for peace were at last entered on
23 march though military operations were not suspended the boer
leaders were granted facilities for meeting and discussing matters among
themselves and with the different com mandoes and after this
had gone on for some time on 15 may a
conference of boer repre sentatives met at vereeniging to consider
terms of surrender among those present were botha beyers smuts
de wet and delarsy it was not until the last
day of the month however that eeace was absolutely secured
the surrender eing signed at pretoria by lords kitchener and
milner and the chief civil and military represen tatives of
the boers and the war thus brought to an end
after over twoandahalf years war the whole of south africa
from cape town to the zambesi had been added to
me british empire the main points agreed upon were thai
the boer forces would immediately lay down their arms and
hand over all guns rifles and munidons of war that
burghers in ihe field outside the transvaal and orange river
colony and all prisoners of war outside south africa on
declaring their acceptance of the position of siibjects of edward
vii should be brought back to their homes as soon
as transport could be provided and their means of subsistence
secured that no proceedings civil or criminal should be taken
against burners so surrendering or returning for acts done in

south the archipelago of tierra del fuego adjoin long 70
w which is also the longitude of cape cod massachusetts
thus its pacific coast and onehalf of its caribbean coast
lie due south of the atlantic coast of the united
states moreover only a relatively small part of the great
equatorial landmass between lat 10 n and lat 25 s
is west of longitude 70 the atlantic coasts form an
enormous angle reaching so far toward the east that sailing
distances between pernamhuco and some of the european ports are
practically equal to the sailing distance between new york and
the same brilian city in reality dien south america from
the point of view of inhabitants of the united states
is sontheast ern america for the varied purposes of social
intercourse and commerce therefore its eastern coasts be low the
equator are as readily reached from europe as from the
great centres of population in the united states and before
the great war this virtual equality in geographic situation was
converted into marked advantage for euro peans by the superior
facilities for transporta tion and direct intercommunication between europe and
the especially important south american atlantic ports to say the
least an advantage which was accentuated so far as it
concerned the nations of southwestern europe by ancient associadon force
of habit and essen tial community of tradition and language
the results were that a large part of the south
eastern continent while developing distinctively new world characteristics in many
ways still constantly received formative ideals and man ners culture
and its fashions from westeuro pean sources and of course
bestowed its trade m the same quarter for studies of
other causes which tended to produce similar effects and for
an account of cjianges wrought during the world war see
latin amebica since the war ended phases of readjustment to
changed conditions in fordgn relations or of new developments in
timehonored ameri can connections have naturally been most in evidence
and of such phases there are three which deserve special
mention first a move ment the aim of which is
to promote the peace and progress of the western hemisirfiere
and to confirm panamerican solidarity compare special memorandum amrrican quesliont
and the monroe doctrine issued by the panameri can union
washington april 1919 second the admirable quality of the views
expressed and confirmed by resolution in the first ameri can
congress of economic and commercial ex pansion which was held
at montevideo official representatives from all south american repub lics
being in attendance and which advocated the establishment of collpges
or departments of economic expansion in colleges and schools to
the end that the study and practical solution of economic
problems may be intensified in the effort to cement pan
america commercial friendship third the actual state of forei trade
as between the united stptes and south america an estimate
by the national city bank of new york showing for
the fiscal year 1919 imports from south america gaining about
150 per cent compared with those of 1914 exports to
south america about 225 per cent the total trade of
the united states with south america including both imports and
exports whicb amounted only to 345000000 in 1914 being estimated
by the same authority at 1000000 000 in 1919 the

of 1782 which for bade foreign ships to navigate the
south seas without the permission of spain in 1790 other

of the alarm of spanish officials a steadily increasing number

admitted by spanish official negotiation with the insurgents and enforced
by the absence of adequate spanish forces to dispute it

to the invitation of colombia and mexico the american govern
ment sent delegates to the panama congress of american plenipotentiaries
called by bolivars famous circular of 7 dec 1824 but
owing to delay caused by the disapproval of the ameri

for the congress thus disappointing latinamerican expectations whatever plans mav
have been conceived by the adams ad ministration for american

the possible need of a more competent naval force on
the west coast to protect american commerce from possible piracy
which might result from he unsettled condition of south american
governments first attracted the attention of the american gjovernmcnt to
the need of a transisthmian pas sage at panama which
was again considered in 183s when charles biddle without proper
au thority of president jackson went to panama and obtained
a canal concession which his government declined to accept and
finally re sulted in a transit treaty with new granada
in 1846 in 1831 a long dispute with argentina arose
through the american destruction of an establishment which the government

final settlement of the british argentine controversy over the right
of juris diction to the islands the longdormant claim of
american liability was revived in 188385 and pronounced by the
american government as wholly groundless because of the derelict condition
of the islands which justified the act of the american
naval officer after 1840 the increasing importance of closer relations
with south america was recogniaed as early as december 1842
the american govemnent received information of a proposed lima congress
of latinamerican states argentina peru bolivia new granada brazil and
mexico to sustain the dominant parties in those states and
to opoose the ad vance of the united states on
the american continent in 1845 argentina and other south american
governments were disappointed in their hopes of active interference of
the ameri can government against the anglofrench blockade of the
coast of buenos aires result ing from brarils invitation of
1844 for their intervention to protect the independence of uruguay
which had been recognized by a treaty of 1828 signed
both by brazil and by buenos aires the american gov

appiehensive of no danger from temporary european inter vention decided
to remain neutral in 1844 for protection of american interests
it sent a small fleet which ofeended the argentina gov
ernment by seizure of vessels of the argentina squadron an
ad which was promptly dis avowed later in march 1846
secretary buchanan stating that the moral mfluence of the united
states was in favor of argentina instructed the american minister
at buenos aires to report promptly any brilifrench activities indicating
territorial designs in june 1845 edward a hopkins was appointed
special agent to paraguay to obtain informa tion with a
view to possible recognition of its independence but in 30
march 1846 largely from regard to argentina he was peremptorily
recalled for exceeding his authority bv his diplomatic negotiations with
paraguay in favor of recognition and by an offer of
mediation be tween the governments of paraguay and buenos aires
in favor of paraguay which by league with coricntes against
argentina would have become the ally of england and france
in their designs fortunately the perplexing ques tion presented to
the american government by participation of european powers in la
plata atfairs was finally settled by discontinuance of the blockade
first by england and soon there after by france in
1850 the american min ister at buenos aires in reply
to a hypothetical auestion dispelled the illusion of general rosas
lat the united states would aid argentina to resist france
in case of war in 1846 serious complications were threatened
by disturbances at panama across which communication be came very

of general flores formerly president of ecuador against ecuador an
expedition which was supposed to have for its purpose the

secretary buchanan reported that spain through calderon had disavowed to

indicating her abandonment of intention to encourage similar expeditions and
removing a main source for apprehension of serious dangers later
in may 1848 he as sured elcuador through instructions in

occasion would employ at least all the moral means within
its power to discourage and arrest intervention or dictation of

american claims for injuries to persons and properly among the
most important subjects of diplomatic negotiation besides claims were the
conditions of the guano trade on the west coast the

1852 in connection with difficulties re sultiijg from restrictions on

steps to protect american inter ests on the detached lobos
islands which had been visited by american seamen for half
a century but after an investigation of claims of title
soon decided through secretary everett to yield lo the protests
of peru in 1858 during the vivanco insurrection in peru
a diplomatic dispute arose over the rights of american ves

with the peruvian seizure of two guano vessels and resulted
in the suspension of diplomatic relations in 1860 the american
acquisition of the gallipagos islands from ecuador suggested about ies2

was regarded as establishing an american pro tectorate over the
islands which had long been important in connection with american
com mercial interests in the pacific at that time ecuador
still apprehensive of the plans of general flores urged the
necessity oi eternal vigilance to prevent vast schemes for european
ascendency in south america and apparently new granada desired the
american govcnunent to adopt a more liberal policy of sustaining
and protecting the nations of south america the american minister
qay at lima convinced that the united stales would be

foreign policy tn relations with span ish america and the

by 1856 there was a decided decline in soutu american

from the filibustering schemes of william walker in central america
and which found expresdon in the continental treaty signed at

and designed to form a closer rela tionship of all

guaranteeing the integrity of spanish america in the opening of

nations by general urquiza pro visional director of the argentine
confedera tion a privilege later confirmed by treaties with the
united states great bnlain and france in july 1853 at
the same time it began preparatory negotiations to secure for
ameri can vessels the navigation of the paraguay river and
upper parana which after vari ous difficulties resulting in an
american naval demonstration paraguay was finally induced to grant in
1859 by treaty its efforts to ob tain the consent
of braal to the opening of the amazon first contemplated

and in volving a series of negotiations with peru and

a treaty during the period of civil war resulting from
slavery and secessioa the american government had little time to
cultivate intimate political social or commercial intercourse with south american
countries on questions in regard to foreign intervention it maintained
the letter of the monroe doctrine but carefully declined south
american invitations or suggestions seek ing american adhesion to an
alliance to guar antee the sovereignty of south american states
a difhcult question arose in 1862 in regard to protection

1863 the american government has frequently indicated its friendly desire
for the welfare and peaceful relations of south amer ican
neighbors when spain in a war begun against peru in
1864 threatened to seize the qiinca islands the american government
promptly expressed its opposition in a protest to the proposed
annexation although it care fully avoided any actual participation in
the war into which it could easily have been drawn
by the expectations of chile and peru and stated that
american policy did not shield american states from a discharge
of their just obligations in 1866 when spain threatened to
take per manent possession of the islands as a means
of reimbursing the expense of the war throu the sale
of guano secretary seward secured her withdrawal by a warning
that in case of such occupation the united states could
not be expected to remain neutral american medi ation resulted
in conferences between repre sentatives of the united states spain
and the allied republics at washington and finally in an
armistice in 1871 which after consider able delay eventuated in
a treaty of peace a later controversy between peru and
chile con cerning expenditures in maintaining the allied naval squadron
in this war was arbitrated in 1875 by the american
minister to chile by con sent of the american government

to adopt sugges tions for a demonstrative action following the
brazilian rejection of the american good offices in 1871 acting
promptly on a report that ger many had proposed to
several european powers the adoption of joint measures to induce
vene zuela to observe her agreements it declared that the
united states would observe with great concern the presentation and
enforcement of demands against an american state by sudt a
combination in 1881 secretary of state blaine planned for the
united states to assnme the posi tion of sole mediator
in international dis putes to which latin american republics were
parties but his policy was not continued by his successor
in 1881 the american ministers at buenos aires and santiago
de chile success fully arbitrated a boundary controversy be tween
argentina and chile in the same year two special american
envoys sent by secretary blaine to secure peace between chile
and peru and bolivia which were at war for possession
of the nitrate mines near the junction of their boundaries
were unfortunately unsuccessful in their efforts and each was rarded
as the crtisan of the country to which he was
sent ter the experienced wm h trescot was sent to
warn chile against excessive demands which might induce the united
states to secure cooperation of other american powers to coerce
her into reasonable moderation acting on this principle of panamericanism
blaine in 1881 sent invitations to all independent american nations
to meet for a discussion of arbitration but these were
recalled by his suc cessor who postponed the conference the
american government promptly recognized the new republic of the united
states of brazil which was proclaimed following a revo lution

naval forces gave notice and practical evidence of his intention
while not intervening to restrict the operations of either party
to protect all american ships entering the rio waters thus
inducing the insurgents to abstain from further interference with com

the insurgents on 13 march 1894 in 1889 the president
of the united states was chosen arbitrator in the settlement
of the a igen tine brazilian dispute in regard to

of the united states amon lai in americans was attended
by representatives of all the american republics its chief topics
of discussion were arbitration and collection of pecuniary claims of
citizens of one country against the govern ment of another

the next hague congress should seek to secure a gen

claims sanitation exten on of steamer service patents trademarks copyrights
and interchange of university pro in 1891 a serious difficulty
arose between the american government and chile with which rehitions
had become somewhat less friendly after 1880 as a result
of secretary blaines apparent sympathy witfi peru in the war
of eagan among the chilean leaders of the lorious party
in the chilean revolution of 1891 and increased by the
american strict interpre tation of neutral duties in the seizure
of the llata later cubninaled in an assault upon sailors
of the american cruiser baltimore while ashore at valparaiso in
october 1891 resulting in the suspension of diplomatic relations and
an american ultimatum from secretary nilies of persons killed and
for the in 1895 the american government in apply ing
the principles of the monroe doctrine against great britain in
the venezuelaguiana boiindary dispute showed a friendly disposition toward venezuela
which was appreciated else where in south america in spite
of secretary olneys extreme interpretation including the provoking assertion that
the american fiat was law on the american continent later
friendly american acts appeared in striking contrast to the bad
conduct of the venezuelan government although the american government did
not accept the venezuelan appeal to intervene in 1902 against
the debtcollecting activities of gertnany and great britain in which
it had been invited to participate but which it did
not approve president roosevelt firmly resisted the later plans of
germany and was successful in terminating the blockade of venezuela
by securing arbitration of the controversy at the hague under
a protocol signed at washington on 13 feb 1903 this
friendly action to gether with the example of american poucy
in cuba contributed much to remove latin amer ican suspicions
arising from the spanishamer ican war american negotiations preliminary to
the construction of the panama canal and various extensions of
the monroe doctrine which aroused apprehensions unfortunately american relations with
venezuela became strained in 1907 under the presidency of cipriano
castro fay a serious controversy aris ing from certain american
asphalt concesons and by the arbitrary expulsion of an american
editor of a venezuebn newspaper the ameri can government seeking
adjustment of all asphalt claims proposed arbitration which was refused
by castro it then agreed to a plan of arbitration
by separating the claims as castro proposed but to which
he later objected in march 1908 absolutely refusing to arbitrate
any of the cases in june 1908 the american government
withdrew its minister and sus pended diplomatic relations and two
months later offered no objection to the contemplated forcible action
of the netherlands against castro in return for his conduct
against the dutch islands near the venezuelan coast but when
castro took flight from his troubles leav ing executive affairs
in charge of a more rea sonable official j v
gomez who sought a of fnendly relations the american i
sent to venezuela a special com william i buchanan who
on 13 feb 1qd9 signed a protocol under which ail
disputes were satisfactorily settled two immediately two within five months
and a last rcmainii one by later adjudication of the
hague american relations with colombia which before 1860 were largely
concerned with prob lems of a transit route across panama
since the american civil war were largely influ enced by
revived american interest in the ques tion of the panama
canal in 1868 in accord with the wish of colombia
for certain changes in the treaty of 1846 the american
govern ment authorized special negotiations at boeoti which resulted in
a draft treaty embodying the monroe doctrine and securing to
the united slates absolute comrol of any canal across the
isthmus this new treaty although approved by secretary seward was
rejected by the senate of colomhia and changed by atnoia
ig v google south abisrica mentb suid alterations which in
february 1869 failed to receive the approval ol the american
senate the altitude of colombia turned american attention toward the
less desirable nicariua route and later resulted in an un
fortunate period of american colombian es trangement and the economic
abolition of the american legation at bogota for several years
before 1878 during which in 1876 colombia turned to the
french for leaderip in the canal enterprise american interest in
the problem was revived in 1879 by de lesseps suggestion
of a joint international guarantee of neutrality for the canal
resulting in 1860 in an executive declaration of american policy
requiring american control of the canal in 1s81 secretary blaine
initiated diplomatic measures to defeat the french enterprise by premature
denouncement of plans for a euro pean guarantee over the
canal efforts to es tablish closer relations with latin america
and fruitless negotiations with great britain for abrogation of the
claytonbulwer treaty of 1850 at the close of the spanish
american war american interest in a canal at panama was
renewed and increased in 1901 the first sub stantial step
toward the realization of a canal under american control was
taken in the nego tiation of the haypauncefote treaty which
terminated the claytonbulwer treaty in 1902 the second step was
taken by an act author izing the purchase of the
panama franchise and unfinished work of the bankrupt french company
the third step the completion of satisfactory arrangements with colombia
proved more difficult and unfortunately resulted in strained relations with
colombia from 1903 to 1919 colombia partly through german in
fluence failed to ratify a convention of 22 jan 1903
by which the united sutes for slo000000 and an annuity
of 250000 beginning 1913 obtained the right to construct the
caiuu and to use and control the canal zone panama
promptly declared indepoidence from colombia and was as promptly recognized
by the united states which on 18 nov 1903 negotiated
with the new republic a treaty similar to that re
jected by colombia recognizing american con trol over a canal
zone 10 miles wide president roosevelt whose policy in panama
was generally approved recognized that co lombia in spite of
her bad faith and her show of resentment against the
united states had a right in equity to compensation in
1909 secretary root negotiated with the colombian minister the rootcortez
treaty which provided for recltnizing the independence of panama by
colombia and payment of s25000000 in 10 annual installments to
colombia by panama colombia refusing to ratify this treaty proposed
to refer the controversy to the hague tribunal the american
govern ment declining this proposal later tnade an amicable offer
to pay an indemnity of 10000 000 which colombia refused
to accept finally throu instructions of secretary bryan the american
government authorized the negotia tion of a treaty signed at
bogota on 7 april 1914 which expressed the regret of
the united states for incidents disturbing the friendship of the
two countries favored colombia by pro visions for readjustment of
the panama bound ary and for i and obligated the
united states to pay ti lombia an indemnity of 000000
this treaty ratiamped y the colombian senate met strong opposition
in the american senate which in definitely postponed action especially
objecting to any expression which might imply a con fession
of improper policy in relation to the panama revolution later
in july 1919 the senate resumed consideration of the treaty
without the objectionable clause meantime a marited increase of friendly
interest between the united states and south american coun tries
followed an extensive tour of secretary elihu root through those
countries in 1906 and later visits of other american statesmen
and other influential americans who contributed much to the elimination
of misunderstandings and prejudices and the consequent modification of opimons
in 1910 the american govern ment used its good ofkces
in joint action with brazil and argentina to settle a
