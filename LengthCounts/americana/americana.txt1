silk artificial for many years manu facturers sought to produce
a material which could be used as a substitute for
silk at the paris exposition in 1889 the comte de
chardonnet exhibited a fibre hav ing characteristics of true silk
this fibre was produced from cellulose of either cotton or
pulp of soft woods and after going through several processes
could be spun and dyed like natural silk thread many
other expenmenters and inventors followed improving and modifying the chardonnet
method artificial silk is not so soft to the touch
as true silk nor has it the strength or elasticity
it is used largely for dress trimmings hosiery cheap ribbons
and upholsteries also for insulating electric wires and in the
manufacture of incandescent mantles it is cuimed that joseph wilson
swann qv was the first one to attempt the production
of artificial silk on a commercial scale the con sumption
of this material in the united states in 1918 amounted
to 5801221 pounds as com pared to 4683543 pounds in
191s silk and the silk industry in this article it
is proposed to trace briefly the his tory of the
manufacture of silk which has been throughout all the past
an article of luxury and which as late as the
3d century of our era commanded a price so great
as to be beyond aa emperors wealth to purchase for
his empress but in our day has come to be
within the means and ability of the great masses of
our people and a necessity instead of a luxury 1
hiatoiy chinese appear to be the first people who applied
themselves to sericulture although some claim for the tussur silk
of india the earliest silk fibre used the words seres
used bj theophanes and serinda by pro copius were in
all probability so used to indi cate that part of
the east which was no doubt china where the silk
industry existed at a very remote period ptolemy was the
first to ue the word seres for china or rather
the north em part of it known later as cathay
and the name is derived from the chinese name of
the silkworm ise tee or ti in korean r whence
the greek 7p the silkworm ltiigtpt the people who furnished
silk and anp silk the ltin iericum has been traced
direct to the mongol sirkeh and the senkoth of isaiah
xix 9 has been supposed to be silk from seneum
is derived the french loie and etymo locally connected with
it are the german ietde anglosaxon seou and engliih tuk
hawaenanue infomu lu in a cbiaem work called the silkworm
classic that selingshl ihc principal queen of hwangle 2640 bc
was the first to rear silkworms and the em peror
hwangte was induced to make robes and garments from this
circumstance the chinese historians carry back the cultivation of the
mulberry and the breeding of silkworms to the mythic period
if they are to be be lieved the art of
silkreeling was known in china in the time of fouhhi
a century before the date traditionally assigned to the biblical
deliige and hwangtes queen did not disdain to share in
the labors attending the care of the insect as well
as in those of the loom the in vention of
which seems to be attributed to her and to have
raised her to the position of a tute lary genius
with special altars of her own but whatever the precise
date of the discovery there can be no question of
the very high an tiquity of the knowledge of the
worm and its product in qiina a series of imperial
edictl and voluminous literature of practical treatises testify to the
importance of the industry and the care that was taken
to foster an art which was considered according to m
de rosny best fitted to promote the morality of the
peo ple and extinguish pauperism in the empire the wives
of he nobles through successive generations personally attended to the
rearing of the silkworms that this silk was of the
mulberryfed kind is evident from a further extract from the
silkworm classic which says that afterward when yu regulated the
waters 2200 bc mention is made tn his work on
the tribute of the land adapted for the mul berry
tree having been supplied with silkworms from which time the
advantage thereof gradu ally increased it is not known whether
silk was uiiliaed in india at so early a period
as this but that india learned the art from china
is generally believed although at what period is not known
aristotle is the first occidental to give a description of
the silkworm speaking of it as a homed insect which
passed through successive transformations and produced bom bykia four hundred
years later pliny described the silkworm but he knew nothing
of its con nection with the production of silk which
he affirmed was a woolly substance combed from the leaves
of trees and spun by the seres for 1200 or
1500 years after silk fabrics had become known in western
asia and eastern europe the prevalent opinion was thai it
was idler a fleece which grew upon a tree thus
with cotton or the fibre fi glc silk and the
silk industry the inner bark of somp tree or shrub
while some deceived by the glossy and silky fibres of
the seed vessels of the aselepias syriaea milkweek and of
the silkcotton tree bom bax believed it was the product
of one or the other of these a few had
come so near the truth as to conjecture that it
was spun by a spider or beetle so carefully did
the orientals keep their secret that it was not exposed
until the 6th century after christ when two nesto rian
monks who had been engaged in misonary labors in china
solved the mystcryj by bring ing to conscantmople a small
quantity of silk worm eggs concealed in the hollow of
their palmer staves the missionaries had observed m china die
various processes connected with the rearing of silkworms the nature
of the trees on which they fed and the preparation
of the silk this occurred in 552 in the reign
of justinian who gave eveiy encouragement to the introduction of
the valuable insect at the proper season the eggs were
hatched and the caterpillars were fed on the leaves of
the wild nulberry tree the monks continued lo super intend
at constantinople the rearing of the insects and the whole
process of manufacturing the silk this knowledge thus made public
soon spread over the world and though the vast production
of silk by the chinese was not diminished that of
europe and western asia was greatly developed in the centuries
thai followed before the introduction of the silk worm in
the west and while its culture still remained a chinese
secret the cities of greece and syria were compelled to
pay so high a price for silk that their fabrics
were sold ounce for ounce for thrir weight in gold
from constantinople sericulture spread over the balkans and the looms
of constantinople athens thebes corinth etc were kept busy with
the product the byiantine silk fabrics became famous and was
much used for ec clesiastical purposes vestments etc the by
zantine looms declined in the 8th and 9lh cen turies
but those of thebes and other grecian cities as also
of syria increased thr produc tion and improved their methods
of manufac ture the greeks maintained their supremacy until the
fall of the eastern empire in the 12th century but
the arabs and saracen princes carried their knowledge of the
manufacture into northom africa spain and portugal and to sicily
the production of spain and sicily was very considerable as
early as the llth century and when the normans conquered
sicily a century later they encouraged the silk industry kin
raaet first norman king of sicily in 1146 invaded greece
and took captive a large number of silkweavers whom he
con strained to settle in palermo and calabria and to
teach his people die greek methods of silk culture venice
and genoa followed rogers example in the i3th century other
cities look up the new manufacture and italy acquired a
prominence in the industry which she has never wholly relinquled
about the 13th century silk began to be manufactured in
france at tours and later at lyons not until 1494
howgt ever did france eiwage successfully as a pro ducer
of cocoons siifxessive rulers of france encouraged the industry but
the revocation of the edict of nantes was a severe
blow as it exiled pbwt 400000 huguenots most of whom
were lkworklt3rs it was long before france recovered her lost
prest and then it was again wrecked at the revolution
under na poleon i and the bourbons a stringent tariff
did much for the industry in france the exiled huguenots
tried sericulture in england but without success until 1718 when
a new method of throwing was introduced the manu facture
then recnved a new impulse and eng lish silks replaced
the french in the european markets the english industry was
ruined by the commercial treaty of 1860 which admitted french
silks duty free switzerland and ger many also became competitors
of france and are largely engaged in the manufacture of
silk belgium and holland have for several centuries engaged in
silk production and the velvets and satins of flanders are
quite as old and of as good quality as those
of the italian cities the manufactured siucs of china japan
and india have a character of their own and for
some purposes are in demand for raw silk production 191319
see table on pa 0 2 history of the industry
ip the united states according to chinese records the fila
ment produced by the silkworm was first suc cessfully woven
by si ling chi eenxiress of china in 2700 bc
but it was not unul the 6th century that the
art of making silk was intro duced in europe in
1609 james i brought the silkworm and the mulberry tree
into ampigland and shortly after this the company of virginia
was formed by a group of englishmen to pro mote
the silk industry in the colonics of america the first
expedition sent to america met with disaster four years later
a more success ful beginning was made influenced by the
crown the colonial legislatures passed an act requiring 10 mulberry
trees to be planted on every hundred acres there was
a fine for neglect of this duty and a premium
for every pound of silk produced bui the most strenuous
effort amounted to little with the ascension of a new
king tothe britjsh throne in 1666 all acts giving bounties
for silk or requiring mul berry trees to be planted
in virginia were re pealed and an interlude occurred in
sericulture until the last years of the century when several
french huguenots settled in south carolina these were skilled silk
workmen and they were iu earnest in their endeavor to
cultivate it in profitable quantities at about the same time
another colony was formed in the same province which was
known for mor than a century by the name of
silk hope during the first 35 years of the 18lh
cen tury the silk industry was also introduced into louisiana
and georgia silk culture by the colonists however had a
fitful and uncertain existence from 1750 to 1772 the period
of its greatest activity before the revolution ike export of
raw silk averaged only 500 pounds per annum and rarely
exceeded 1000 pounds in a single year for many years
after the revolufionait war premiums and bounties for planting mul
berry trees and for producing raw silk were authorized by
a number of the stales in december 1825 the subject
of silk culture re ceived national attention a resolution being
introduced and referred to the committee on agriculture this committee
reported favorably and directed the secretary of the treasury to
prepare a manual on die growth and manufac 8nk and
thb silk industry tnre of silk inquiries for infornatton on
the subject were sent out by the secretvr ur ridiard
rush in 1s26 and from the replies and other material
received a manual was com piled entitled letter from the
secretary of the treasury six thousand copies were printed by
order of confess this document contained 220 pages besides illustrations
of macbinety such favorable action and the publication by congress
at mat subsequent sessions of other documents relating to silk
culture together with the serious considention of the subject by
the consressional committee on manufac ture and the committee on
agriculture en listed general attention sericulture gainl the eiblic ear
legislatures of several states pasted lis for its encouragement and
a most deter mined effort was made to place siucgowing
on a paying basis silk conventions were held in uaryland
new jersey new york and con necticut all efforts failed
however to make sericulture popular in this country the amei
omnufacture was conductsd in the vidnitjr of paterson n i
a mill town within easy access of the new york
markets which has grown to be the leading siucproducing city
of the united states other advantageous centres were found in
the coal fields of pennsylvania where fuel was cheap and
this stale now pro duces more manufactured silk than any
other state in the union the sewingsilk and floss industry
has always been confined chiefly to the new england states
in 1860 without the protectiob of a high tariff the
total production of the industry amounted to 6600000 at that
time importations of manufactured silk were valued at 330000a these
have remained nearly constant the production figures hav however grown
in tremendous proportions and in 1914 reached a total of
2m000000 while the number of employees rose from 5000 to
108000 the following tables of the imports of raw silk

ican producer could not compete with the cheap labor of
the orient and europe and other lines of industry afforded
greater remuneration the manufacture of silk fabrics however has gained
great success in 1810 rodney and horatio hanks erected the
first mill on this continent the manufacture of silk trimmings
of various kinds was begun in 1815 at philadelphia and
ribbtms in l829 at baltimore here too the american manufacturer
waa handicapped by foreign competition and it was not unul
a protective taris was enforced that the industry prospered in
order to provide money to meet the heav expenses of
the government caused t the civil war a high import
duty was placed on all luxuries including silk the duty
was made 30 per cent on manufactured silk on 2
march 1861 and in august of the same year was
raised to 40 per cent the tariff was again advanced
on 30 june 1864 to 60 per cent this tune
not onl for revenue but for protection following this advance
there was an immediate show of activity amoi those engaged
in silk importing to consider the possibilities of manu facturing
at home those already engaged in the manufacture of silk
received a fresh stimulus in 1872 the silk association of
america was organized in new york to pro mote in
all measures the common interest of silkmaking in the united
states at the cen tennial exposition held in philadelphia in
1876 americanmade silk favorably compared with that of foreign manufacture
much of the the maattfactnn of silk the filament spun
by the silkworm jnto a cocoon is so fine that
several must be reeled together to ioduce a thread of
sufficient siae to handle this is done in large factories
called filatures here the cocoons are placed in bauns of
hot water near the boiling temperature several filaments from as
many cocoons as are required for the siae of the
rawsilk thread desired are com bined twisted and reeled into
skeini when the filament from one cocoon has become ex
hausted it is replace b another cocoon and the rceler
adjusts the site of the thread by controlling the number
of fresh and partially exhausted cocoons which are forming the
thread a single cocoon of good quality may furnish from
400 to 800 yards of reelable fila ment asiatic silks
reeled by different filatures and different qualities from the same
filature are designated oy colorful labels called chops silk that
has been reeled is known as raw silk the damaged
cocoons and the parts of each cocoon which cannot be
reeled are known as waste silk waste silks are combed
and spun into spun silk or silkschappe yarns silk is
imported from europe and aua jan supplying by far the
greater portion japanese raw silk is prepared for shipment m
books containing from 25 to 30 tightly rolled skeins these
are packed in bales wdgfaing from 125 to 140 pounds
chinese silks are packed and shipped in a manner quite
similar to japanese silks italian stiks are packed in laie
bales weighing from 200 jiounds upward 6ilk and ras silk
industry the silk trsed in the manufacture of stqc fabrics
may be divided into three general classi fications as follows
silk threads as they come from the feeler where several
of the cocoon threads have been united into one 2
silk known as organzine in which ihe original threads have
been twisted and several of these twisted threads have been
united together 3 silk known as tram in which threads
coming from the reeling machine have been very lightly twisted
togeilier when silk threads arc woven as they come from
the recier without having been dved the natural gum whifh
they contain gives them enough body to make ihem suitable
for weaving h the threads are dyed before weaving this
gum is removed in the dyeing process and to give
the threads strength and cohesion they are twisted before dyring
this is the work of the throwster throwing the throwing
process divides silk into two broad classifications organiine and tram
organrine is generally used for the warp or lenh of
the fabric and tram for the filling or width silk
used for organzine is usually of better quality than silk
used for tram as the organzine warp is subjected to
more strain in the process of manufacturing in throwing organzine
the silk after soaking is first wound upon bobbins it
is then a single thread each single thread is twisted
usuallv 16 turns per inch two of these twisted threads
are doubled together and the resulting thread is twisted in
the opposite direction usually 14 turns per inch the twisting
operations are known as simnning and unite the filaments into
one strong even thread which is suitable for warping in
some cases more than two threads are com bined in
throwing tram or the material with which the warp is
filled the silk goes through various operations similar to organzine
but because it is to be used as a filhng
and not subjected to the same continued strain as the
warp it is not as tightly twisted the twist in
tram is from two and onehalf to five turns per
inch if the silk is to be dyed before weav
ing it must be taken from the bobbins and re
turned to skein form organzine is reeled into skeins of
about 20000 yards length and tram into skeins of shorter
lengths according to the number of threads into which the
silk has been doubled after reeling short ties or laces
passing through the dycingand subsequent op erations prior to weaving
the skeins are finally inspectei and put up in large
bundles ready for the dyer there are many variations to
the throwing process the most important of which is the
making of crepe fabrics to pre pare silk ihrtads for
crepes the twist is greatly increased and runs from 60
to 75 turns per inch this fabric is woven before
being dd dyeing the dyer boils the skeins in soap
and water which removes the natural gum from them and
leaves them soft and lustrous they are dien rinsed and
passed on to the dye vat after dywng the skeins
are dried and packed for shipment to the weaver iveaving
tht silk entering into a woven fabrie is known in
the manufacturing trade by several names the silk threads running
lengwhs u mikd th warp md tboh run ning crosswise
which bind the warp to make the fabric are known
as the filling or the shot hiey are also spoken
of as picks an ordinary warp may nave from 1000
to 20000 ends of thread in a yard of width
the process of putting the above number of threads on
a beam to be placed into the loom is com
monly known as the warping process the threads are warped
in bands of from 300 to 600 at a time
each band running the entire leng of the warp which
may vary from 300 to 1200 grds when the necessary
number of bands ve been placed side by side on
the roller the warp is then transferred in its entirety
of from 1000 to 15000 ends to another beam and
is placed in the back of the loom each indi
vidual thread of this warp is passed through the harness
in the loom preliminary to being manipulated into the fabric
this process is known as entering the thread if the
loom con tains an old warp which has already been
entered in the harness the new warp is simply twisted
on thread for thread to the old warp in preparing
filling for use in the loom the filung thread generally
tram is wound on spools these spools are placed in
what is known as a quilling machine which transfers the
silk from the spools to a long thin ilinder called
a quill a quill when covered with silk is placed
into the shuttle formerlv the quill of a feather was
used or this purpose and hence the name the modem
power4oom is a strong iron frame at the back of
which is the horizontal beam or roller from which the
warp unwinds and at the front the roller on which
the web is wound as it is made between the
two is the harness which is a series of frames
with eyelets one for every thread or set of threads
of the warp in plain or taffeta weaving the harness
frames are in two sets of three frames each one
set of which is up while the other is down
the number can be increased to sev eral frames all
acting independent of each other for complicated patterns between the
beam and the harness is the reed through which the
warp threads pass to the takeup roller in front of
the loom and between the harness and the web roller
the shuttle and the batten as the machine revolves the
warp threads passing from the beam throu the reed are
lifted or draressed by the harness in the opening made
by such lifting or depressing the shuttle flies across the
warp and the batten beats up the thread it leaves
and a new woof is added to the fabric the
complications of the fabric reveal themselves as soon as the
power is turned on and the actual web begins to
appear dose compact and delicate fancy weaves and patterns necessitating
different colors are often woven on what is known as
a boxloom fabrics vary from single colors to eight colors
or more in the filling this necessitates up to eight
or more different shuttles being used for uie filling the
con tainers for these shuttles on the loom are known
as boxes hence the term boxloom in order to form
complicated designs individual warp threads of the loom were in
olden limes con trolled by hand the threads being lifted
or depressed thus letting the shuttle pass over or under
them forming the weave this method is still pursued in

silky secretions of the caterpillars of the ordinary silkwonn taken
from the insects body and constituting the lustrous and strong
line so well known to anglers under the name of

in the water in securing the secretion the worm is
placed in vinegar and the incipient cocoon is then taken
from it soaked in water dried and bleached to a
pure white by passing through fumes of sulphu silkworms entomolltically
any cater pillar which spins a cocoon of silky fibre
i pop ularly the various species which yield a fibre
used commercially all are caterpillars of moths and feed upon
foliage of vanous trees and shrubs among the less important
species the following are probably best known the japanese oakfeeding
silkmoth sombyx yama mm is noted for its greentinted silk
which is used in japan and shina for embroidery a
ckse relative fl ptryni also an oakfeeding insect is a
native of northern china where its large grayishbrown trocoons are
used to a condctable extent for threads and various fabrics
the chinese also use for the mann factnre of a
soft fabric die gray silk of an lied species b
cynlkia which feeds on the tree of heaven iailanfktu glanduhsa
since the thread cannot be reeled the silk is obtained
by carding methods so far as known these species have
not been extensively employed commercially except in the orient though
oiey have been used tentatively in france and other silkmanufacturing
countries the tussur or tusseh moth antheraa paptiia spins a
hard grayishwhite cocoon from which the natives of india where
the species is indigenous manu facture tussur silk the bengalese
use the pure white silk of the boro poloo boittbyx
ttxtor and the yellow silk of the daseeworm b fortmnatus
for making a silk clodi which rarely reaches the worlds
markets because of its in ferior quality several north and
south amer ican species yield silk which has not become
commercially important the native silkworms of th united states mexico
and central amer ica have never been properly commercial ex
ploited or cultivated but several varieties possess qualities which would
seem to promise success to him who would raise them
scien tifically they are hardy and spin large quanti ties
of excellent strong silk they feed upon a much larger
variety of food than do the silk worms commercially known
to the old world this comprises the leaves of the
oak apple maple hickory willow sycamore and many other trees
one of the most promising of these american silkworms telea
polyphemns is a large bnffcolored morii the cocoon threads are
bound together with a hard gluey matter which has to
be softened before un winding can be done the tropseluna
the larva of which feeds on the leaves of several
forest trees is somewhat similar to the fore going and
both resemble the yamanai culti vation and proper selection would
undoubtedly improve them commercially the amount of silk they produce
is far greater and stronger than is produced by the
chinese silkworm btit die thread cannot be so easily reeled
the most important and most widely dis seminated species of
silkworm is bombyx mori which belongs to the family bombycidje
a native either of northern china or of bengal it
seems to have been domesticated at a ery early date
which is placed by chinese authori ties at 26w bc
when the wife of emperor hoangtl began feeding the caterpillars
in 552 two monks brought eggs to constantinople superintended experiments
in cultivating the worms and turned the industry over to
the emperor justinian by whom it was monopo lited neighboring
peoples soon took it up however and now many countries
especially those of the mediterranean region persia india and andiia
raise silk in commercial quantities the commercial silkworm is the
larva of a large moth with a short thick body
stout legs and broad white wings crossed by several black
lines or by a pale ter upon the anterior pair
in early summer the females lay from 200 to 5o0
bluish eggs about as large as a pins head singly
upon any convenient surface gluing them there by a mucilaginous
secretion silky when dry these do not hatch until the
following spring then the larvk about onequarter of an inch
long and yellowishgray or brownish begin to feed and soon
consome about their eir i own weight of foliage daily
and in rapidly in size when about 10 days old
they become lethargic and stop eating until after they have
cast their skins in this operation the old skin bursts
near the front and the cater pillar squirms itself out
leaving the old skin attached to the branch or leaf
upon which it was statwned the worms raindly increase in
size immediately after the molt then steadily diminish as the
time for the next molt ap proaches the process is
performed four times before the caterpillar spins its cocoon which
it does when about six weeks old at this time
it is about three inches long and half an inch
in diameter has 12 visible body segments three fairs of
true legs and five pairs of prolegs t now ceases
to feed empties its alimentary tract and seems to shrink
in size the spinning then begins by the insect making
iirst an outer network known as the floss and then
wind ing the silk in a continuous thread around its
body which continues to decrease in size the completed cocoon
is oonsiderably shorter than he caterpillar itself being only about
one and onehalf inches long the operation of spin ning
occupies about five days during which time the insect usually
produces from 2000 to 3000 feet of ulk which when
microscopically ex amined is seen to consist of two blended
strands these are produced by special glands sericteria which extend
nearly the whole length of the body and terminate in
apertures spinnerets situated in the mouth in from 15 to
20 days after the chrysalis has been formed the adult
insect emerges lays its eggs and dies it has been
estimated that there are about 20 000 to 40000 eggs
popularly known as seed in an ounce about one ounce
of eggs will yield 100 pounds of cocoons or nine
pounds of raw silk from is to 20 pounds of
good mul berry leaves should yield one pound oi cocoons
and a wellgrown mulberry tree should yield about 100 pounds
of leaves the amount of space allowed for the caterpillars
produced from an ounce of eggs varies from one square
yard inunediately after hatching to about 64 square yards when
spinning time arrives each change being double the previous space
2 4 8 16 and 32 the food of the
caterpillars is preferably the foliage of the white mulberry tree
montf atba but several other species are employed notably the
japanese mulberry m japontca the ailpine mulberry m alpina and
m tmuli caulis andjvf moreltl the osage orange qv is
occasionally used as a substitute but is said to produce
an inferior rade of silk the black mulberry m nigra
is objectionable because it is slow in growth the caterpillars
also thrive upon the leaves of lettuce and some other
in the cultivation of the silkworm the first requisite is
an ample supply of foliage this is usually obtained by
growing the mulberry trees far enough apart to ive each
ample room to develop its branches in all directions the
distance varying from 15 to 40 feet depending upon the
variety method of training etc fre quently the trees are
treated much the same as in pollarding qv except that
ihe branches are cut while small the eggs having been
kept over winter at a temficrature of less than 50
p in a 4iy circulating atmoipherc an bm want placed
in a room or an incubator in whidi the temperature
is raised gradually to about 73 in about 10 days
the larvx emerge and are cov ered with sheets of
perforated paper sprinkled with chopped mulberry leaves which should be
renewed about nine times during the first 24 hours each
time by placing a fresh paper above the soiled one
which should be burned paper with larger perforations is necessary
as the worms grow as they approach maturity their appetities
become voracious when rcat to spin they should be supplied
with brust straw or other material upon which to form
their cocoons and the temperature at this time should be
kept about 7s and the humidity close to 65 at
all times scrupulous cleanliness is essential as also is abundant
fresh air when spinning is completed no sound is heard
inside the cocoon the cocoons are then sorted according to
quality size and color into nine grades for manufacture a
separate lot being selected for breeding the sexes are readily
recognized the males being smaller and their cocoons having more
pointed ends than those of the females after grading they
are heated to destroy the insects within whose emergence if
left alive would break the thread many times the manufacturing
process is then begun where a uniform and favorable temperature
is not maintained where humidity and purity of the air
are impaired and still more where there is deviation from
the strictest cleanliness silk growers have often experienced serious losses
of their caterpillars at all stages of their growth purifying
the breeding and feeding quarters after each crop and again
before the introductktb of a new one are essential the
walls are whitewashed the trays sterilized in various ways and
the artments fumigated with burning sulphur no detail that will
ensure cleanliness throughout the feeding period must be neglected else
the worms may suffer from the diseases which follow in
the wake of neglect four of these called in france

into an upper and lower division and as the studv
con tinued year after year higher and higher strata were
added to the top of the cambrian series likewise in
the study of the silurian strata murchison included lower and
lower strata and thus the two systems overlapped it finally
appeared that murchisons lower silu rian and sedgwicks upper cambrian
were equivalents and this gave rise to a long con
troversy as to the use of the proper terra this
controversy outlived the two principals and has only recently been
settled by the adoption of lapwoiths name ordovician for the

melody that recalls the best of poes poetry though silva
never flisplays the weird fancy of the latters tales he
was original in many ways hi lines are often as
nuiical as the best in the spuiish tongue he invented
new rhymes reformed and reshaped old ones introduced still others
from foreign laiwuages and successfully adapted them to the spanish

latinamerican poets of which the leaders were rub dano qv

his style and his unnatural pes simism the poetry produced
by his imitators has been for the most part of

and copper are formed in smelting argentiferous copper ores the
silver and copper being subsequently separated by refining as pure
silver is soft and abrades easily al silver used in
coinage or for making silverware is alloyed with copper to
give hard ness the united states silver coinage con tains
900 parts silver and 100 parts copper british coinage contains
925 parts silver and 75 parts copper silver is not
affected by either dry or moist air 31 ordinary temperatures
neither is it af fected by caustic alkalies or vegetable
acids it is dissolved fcn hot concentrated sulphuric acid and
easily ussolved by nitric acid sul phuretted hydrogen forms black
silver sulphide and to this is due the familiar tarnishing
or blackening of silverware either by articles of food containing
sulphur as eggs or by the mi note percentage of
sulphuretted hydrogen contained in city air or the air of
rooms when coal gas is used as an illuminant socalled
oxydized silver is silver with a superficial black coating obtained
by immersing in potassium sulphide or platinum chloride frosted silver
has a rough dead surface produced by heating with nitre
silver forms three oxides but none is of any particular
importance silver chloride agcl readily formed as a curdy white
pre cipitate on adding a soluble chloride to an acid
solution of a silver salt is insoluble in acids but
readily soluble in ammonia in potassium cya nide and in
sodium hyposulphite and less soluble in a saturated solunon of
any one of several chtorides it is alsd fafmed in
treating stiver ores with common salt silver nitrate agno formed
by dissolving silver in nitric acid is a white crystalline
salt readily soluble in water fused and ltst into sticks
it is known as lunar caustic and is used in
surgery in solution it is used as a chemical reagent
silver bromide agbr and silver iodide agl resemble the chloride
and like it are used in photography silver sulphate agso
a slightly yeflow crystalline salt is readily soluble in hoi
water but less in cold silver sulphide black is formed
by adding a soluble sulphide to a silver salt silver
ores the minerals which singly or in combination are mined
as silver ores may be divided into three classes silver
minerals proper lead silver minerals and lead copper minerals in
the first class come native sil ver cerargyrite argeittite pyrargyile
prousite native silver occurs in irregular bunches or threadlike or
branching masses either by itsdf or associated with other silver
ores or with native copper it adds to the value
of an ore body but rarely occurs in sufficient quantity
to he worked for itself the once famous silver islet
mine on the north shore of lake superior produced splendid
specimens of native silver cerargyrite horn silver is the chloride
and contains 753 per cent of silver when pure it
occurs in hornlike masses of a grayish color which turns
black on exposure to light is so soft that it
can be easily cut with a knife and is of
common occurrence in what is known as the oxydizcd zone
of mines worked for silver rich masses have been taken
from the mines at leadville colo and there are many
other mines producing this ore in the west larger quantities
have come from some mexican mines particularly those in guanajuato
embolite a chlorobromide agfclbr bromyrite the bro mide and ioayrite
the iodide resemble horn silver closely and are found associated
with it argentite or silverglance silver sulphide agis is the
commonest of the silver minerals proper it is black has
a metallic lustre and cuts easily though harder than hornsilver
when pure it contains 871 per cent of silver silver
sulphide combines readily with the sul phides of antimony or
arsenic forming double salts of these pyrargyrite 3agjssbs or ruby
silver ore contains 60 per cent of silver proustile sagisasisi
also called niby sil contains 655 per cent stcphanite but
usually part of the silver is replaced by copper and
part of the antimony by arsenic niese double sulphides at
american silver mines seldom occur in bodies of sufhcient size
and purity to be worked alone but aire not un
common one or more are found at mines in montana
idaho utah colorado and arizona large masses of pyrargyrite have
been taken from mines in the state of guanajuato mex
ico mention may be made of the mines in the
ruby district of gunnison county colo and al silver city
idaho the silver ores usually occur in veins or in
irregular replace ment deposits formed by hot magmatic waters in
the vicinity of igneous intrusions silver being a precious metal

profit and loss in working a mine of the leaasilver
ores by far the most important is ealena lead sulphide
pbs practically all galena contains silver tik extremes being represented
by galena from carinthia austria containing 05 ounce per ton
and from idaho up to 2040 ounces per ton in
galena the silver is present either as isomorphous silver sulphide
or some finely dis seminated silver mineral in oxydized lead
oret cerus site etc the silver is mostly present as
diloride of the strictly copper silver ores the most important
is tetrsmednte or gray cop per ore which is essentially
a sulphide of cop per and antimony 4cussbisi though actually
of verv varying composition and the related nuneral tennantite 4cuisasisi
also called gray copper these minerals are of common occurrence
in gunnison clear creek summit and gilpin counties colo silver
is also found associated widi chalcopyrite chalcocite bornite and other
copper minerals also with iron pyrite zinc blende hematite and
various nuuerals all of which may be classed as silver
ores when the percentage of silver is enough to make
its extraction profitable today the largest part of the worlds
silver supply comes from mines not worked for silver alone
but rather for gold copper or lead the silver being
a byproduct llius it happens that the opera tion of
many silverproducing mines and the resulting output of silver depend
not on the market price of silver but on the
price of lead or copper this is not true however
of the cobalt district ontario where silver is the leading
metal and cobalt and nickel are by uetailurgr of suvcr
orn silver ores as previously noted may be divided into
silver ores proper silverlead and silvercopper ores ttiey may also
be divided into 1 freemilting 2 refraaory and 3 smelting
ores the first includes native silver also the chloride and
bromide of silver the metal being extracted by its forming
an amalgam with mercury in so called refractory ores usually
silver sulphide with or without the sulphides of arsenic and
antimony the ores are roasted with salt or otherwise treated
prior to amalgamation the smelting ores include particularly silverlead and
silvercopper ores the oldest of the methods of extracting silver
by amalgamation one still used in uexico is the patio
process in this the ore is coarsely crushed by stamps
or by a chilean mill then transferred to an ar
rastra a circular space paved with stone where the ore
mixed with water is ground fine under heavy stones drawn
around by mules by the addition of mercury all gold
and free silver are extracted the wet ore is then
spread on the patio or amalgamating floor thoroughly mixed with
3 to 5 per cent of salt by mules treading
it allowed to stand a few days and then copper
sulphate and mercury are added and the ore well trodden
for several days mercury being added from time to time
to collect the silver as an amalgam the chemical reactions
which lake place are complicated finally the mass is washed
to remove nonmetallic material the heavy silver amalgam is collected
and the mcr cury recovered by distillation leaving the silver
of the modem amalgamation processes the waihoe was developed for
treating the complex 7sr is silvergold ores of the comsttxjt
lode the ore was broken in a crusher reduced to
pulp by stamps aud then transferred to iron pans four
to six feet gtn diameter known as amalga mating pans
the pans had a false bottom or die on which
revolved an iron plate or muuer having castiron shoes the
ore pulp one to three tons with the necessary amoiml
of salt copper sulphate and mercury was heated with a
steam coil or by blowing in steam and ground three
to five hours then the lic matenal was washed away
and the amalgam collected vari ous modifications of the washoe
process have been devised and there are still many mills
using some form of pan amalgamauon but the extrac tion
is usually not very high silver chloride is soluble in
a saturated sohible solution of salt and more soluble in
sodium hyposulphite hence processes have been devised which aim to
con vert the silver in an ore to a chloride
by roast ii with salt and then remove it by
leaching in the augusdn process the roasted ore is leached
with a solution of salt and in the rus sell
process with sodium hyposulphite and cuprous sodium hyposulphite neither process
is now in use in the united states smelting where
practicable has the advan tages of simplicity speed and often
high ex traction as compared with all other methods of
treating ores not free milling it is the regular method
of treating leadsilver and coppersilver ores lead ores are smelted
in the usual way see lead the silver goes into
the lead and is recovered by the zinc or parkes
process in the copper ores see coppeb the silver goes

of the metal in producing silverware are hammered or repouss
engraved chased enameled etc antiquea it was a very frequent
condi tion of the itoubloua early periods of european history
that the inhabitants of a castle or small town had
to migrate taking what wealth they had with them the
roman invaders generals often carried with them on their campaigns
large services of silver for their camp life frequently such
migratory hordes were at tacked and overwhelmed and if lime
permitted they hurriedly buried uieir mosi valued pos sessions to
such action we owe much treas uretrove and from the
finds we learn to what a marvelous perfection the ancients
brought their silver plate among the most important discoveries by
accident of such hid den wealth are the following the
treasure of bemay discovered 1830 at benhouville normandy contained w
pieces weiring about 55 pounds of beautifully wrought embossed decorated
silverware part belonged diased subjects from the ihad and the
his tory of achilles the greek hero one of these
pieces contains fine depictions of no less than 42 personages
the collection is in the bibli othque nationale paris the
pieces are of different dates before the roman empire up
to the 3d century ad another wonderful buried collection of
silverware is the hlldesheim treasure now in the antiquarium museum

a large amount of treasure has been unearthed mostly now

the saving was turned into gold and silversmiths work starting
about the 13th century we find the almory containing more
precious wares of he family the cupboard consisted of boards
placed on trestles to hold and display the wealth in
silver cups and other wares of the family this easily
portable furniture gave way in times of peace to a
madeup dresser of so many stages or shelves on which
to dress or display the silver services and showpieces with
greater refinement arrived the sideboard or cre dence for the
same purpose to be followed by the buffet the number
of stages kept in creasing as the wealth in plate

plate the discovery of the process used in the production
of this ware was made by a sheffield cutler thomas
boul sover often misspelled bolfiover in 1742 he found that
a layer of silver could be welded to a copper
plate by heat and pressure he ap tiears to nave
made only plated buttons and small ware joseph hancock soon
advanced the method into the making of table services and
larger pieces the silver fused to the base metal was
standard 925 alw this early ware was plated only on
one side doubleplating on both sides started some time between
1763 and 1770 to hide the central layer of copper
exposed on the edge it was necessary to attach a

is the transition period when german silver and other light
colored alloys look the place of copper as a base
the enormous demand for fine sheffield plate ware in the
period is easily conceivable when we remember that the great
difference in cost brought fine silver services within tihe reach
of many thousands of the middle classes who had been
using pewter and earthenware the beauty of some of the
elaborate creations brought about by the immense and profitable sales
made the nobikty and gentry converts to its prestige even
royalty took to the majestic ipergnes lea and coffee equipages
consist ing of urns for hot water tea and coffee
which were more attractive than any solid silverware ever before
produced but the brothers geot and henry elkington of birmingham
invented a method of silver deposition on base metal by
electric current after patient perfection of their process they obtained
in 1840 a patent for the electroplating process as done
at this day the extremely low price at which base
metal ineces could be produced with a precious metal surface
of any desired thickness quickly killed the sheffield plate business
and rapidly evolved a great industry colonial silverware much early
silver ware found in the new england states was im

this country grew in number with the increase of wealth
of the colonies boston mid new york were the oroducers
of most of this early american plate but there were
a num ber of workers in silver strange to say
many of them were blacksmiths as is shown tw con

other sins are called actual sins offenses against purely human
law may be crimes mis demeanors etc and the same
may be called sins but a sin is not necessarily
a crime no matter how heinous it may be for
example the most grievous sins may be sins purely of
thought or of desire or intention of these human law
cannot take cognizance and hence they are not crimes or
misdemeanors sins are variously classed namely as of omission and
of commission as against god our fellowmen or ourselves as

regarding these several kinds of sin and classifications of sins
theologians of all schools are in agreement except the last
di vision that of mortal and venial the divines of
the protestant churches in the time of the reformation while
admitting a difference among sins so that some would tgte
more heinous than others looked on all sins alike as
mortal that is deserving everlasting punishment thus calvin writes the
sins of believers are venial not because they do not
merit death but be cause there is no condemnation for

doctrine of the roman catholic qiurdi it is taught that

the is a name for the so cial reform which
henry george proposed in progress and poverty this book was
first published in 1879 but the social reform it pro
poses had been foreshadowed by its author in his monograph
our land and land policy pubushed in 1871 he had
discussed it also in newspaper editorials and magazine articles and
had subjected it to criticism through extensive personal correspondence having
satisfied himself of the economic and moral soundness and the
political feasibility of the reform he devoted his life from
the beginmng of his task of writing progress and poverty
in 1877 until his death in 1897 to popularizing it
and to promoting political action in furtherance of its leslative
adoption in the course of this agitation he wrote several
additional books only less famous than progress and poverty among
them being social problems pro tection or free trade an
open letter to pope leo xiii on the condition of
labor a perplexed philosopher a criticism of her bert spencer
in certain respects and a pos thumously published incomplete treatise
the science of political economy in addition he carried his
agitational work to the lecture plat form making two tours
of great britain and ireland one of australasia and several
through the united states and canada as an editor he
advocated the reform first in the san fran cisco post
a daily newspaper and later in the new york statidard
a weekly both under his own proprietorship and as a
maga line contributor he discussed it in the popular science
monthly the north american review the century magasiae the arena
and period icals of similar character in the united states
and abroad his political activities includ ing two gigantic campaigns
for mayor of new york 1886 and 1897 in the
latter of which he suddenlj died a few das before
the elec tion were inspired and rigidly governed like his
authorship and his editorial work and lec turing by his
devotion to the singletax coming first into use in 1888
this name is the one now best known in the
united states canada and australasia it had currency in great
britain for a time but the more familiar term there
has for several years been taxation of land values in
rmany the current name is bodenreform numerous other designa tions
have been used land restoration antl poverty free soil land
and labor etc none of them all however is satisfactorily
de scriptive although the reform they designate involves alterations in
the prevailing systems of land tenure it is more than
a landtenure re form while it would begin partly for
strategic reasons with land value taxation and notwithstanding that for
more substantial reasons this method may be advocated as a
permanency yet the reform itself has no fiscal limitations whereas
the tax proposed would by a single tax the essential
character of the reform is neither the tax nor its
singleness and although the reform aims at abolition of involuntary
poverty and of exploitation of labor its fiscal method for
attaining these ends is one of its characteristics to understand
the singletax therefore recourse to verbal defini tions of its
names will not do its essential principles and its distinctive
method for their realization in public policy and law must
be taken into account and considered together the primary social
utility principle of the singletax as formulated by henry george
is associaiion in equality this is referred to as the
natural law of progress without asso ciation progress would be
impossible without equality of opportunity to live and to earn
the progress which association produces reacts in juriously upon itself
and engenders poverty as a social phenomenon the secondary sodalultlity
principle of the singletax proceeds logically from its primary one
ecjuality of opportunity to live and to earn being inconsistent
with monopoly of nat ural resources equal rights to natural
resources which are comprehended in the economic tech nical term
land is an unescapable condition of sodal progress without social
poverty it is also imperative as a condition of the
social morality that is implied by such phrases as the
brotherhood of man and wluch finding relious expression in the
golden rule of thnstian teaching and the second great com
mandment of oiristian and jewish teaching alike gets political expression
through the hu man equality clauses of the american declara
tion of independence d google inasmuch then as the requirements
of social morality and social utility coincide in this respect
the broad basic principle of the single tax is a
coordination of sodal utiuty and social morality principles it demands
equal rights to loud but the basic jjrinciple of the
singletax is not necessarily mconsistent with individual titles to land
whatever is socially useful in a public policy that recognizes
individual titles may be harmonized in practice with the prind
ele of equal rights any community could armonize the two
for itself by socialidng the land values within its jurisdiction
instead of attaching equality of rights to the land direct
it could do 90 indirect by socializing such ot the
profits of the whole area as are fairly at tributable
to its superior nattu qualities and locational advantages nor would
this be a difficult matter separation of the proampts of
mere ownership of natural opportumttes from the prtts of their
use is practicable by refer ence to the principle of
ricardos law of eco nomic rent this law affords an
approximately accurate and substantially fair measure of the difference between
the incomes that land users earn whether they are landowners
or not and incomes or other financial benefits from mere
ownership for it measures with reasonable accuracy the varying financial
advantages of natural resources tn rough every gradation from the
zero value of superabundant fertile land at social frontiers to
the fabulous values of rich mineral deposits easily accessible to
mar kets and the choicest sites for business oper ations
in a metropoliian city these financial advantages whether estimated as
annual values or as caiutal values are land values in
sin etax terminology to socialibe land valuet is therefore dieingletax
method of securing equality of rifts to land without abolishing
any oi the socially useful attributes of private title nor
need the reform be made abruptly or throu novel modes
of land administration so as to shock a socially useful
conservatism or any reasonable sense of social prudence it can
be established by a deviation from present fiscal principles and
policies with hardly any alteration of present fiscal methods this
is the point at which taxation principles and poli cies
enter into the singeltax though consid ered as a fiscal
reform alone the change pro posed would be in the
direction of simplicity and greater fairness it consists in so
modify ing real estate taxation as to exempt improve ments
leaving land values to ear the burden this modification would
not of itself socialize all land values the entire amount
of real estate taxation being less annually than annual land
values but besides socializing more land val ues than are
socialized now it would discour age monopoly of idle land
by increasing die taxation expense of keeping it idle and
it would encourage the improving of land by les sening
taxation expenses of improvement and maintenance it would therefore tend
toward the social aims of the singletax this tend ency
would be accelerated if all personal taxes for revenue were
abolished taxes for police regulation are not within the purview
of the singletax though objectionable as beine the most unfair
and least effective of regulation methods but with land values
as the sole source of public revenues industrial activity would
be doubly stimulated first by freedom from tax burdens second
by the lowering of capitalized values of natural resources titrou
market gluts of idle land taxed out of useless and
obstructive ownership the second of those causes of industrial stimulation
would be land consequent upon the necessity in order to
derive pubhc revenues exclusively from land values on a falling
market of increasiiq the rates of taxation on capitalized land
values this action and reaction lowering of capital ized values
of land by market gluts of idle land and consequent
raising of tax rates might result in drawing approximately all
land values into public treasuries in that event aiid so
long as the condition continued land values would be wholly
socialized if however any considerable amount remained continuously un sodalized
extensions of public functions and further improvements in public service
could be made at the expense of land values until
their sodallzation was approximately and per manently complete to abolish
all tasfs save upon land values in itself a benefidal
tax re form is therefore the method of the single
tax for securing all its sodal objects to summarize in
inverse order of statement the sinetax is a proposal to
1 abolish all taxation save upon land values for the
pur pose a of improving taxation in the direc tion
of simplid and fairness and in the in terest of
industry by b exempting produc tion from taxation and c
promoting tenden cies toward socialization of land values its purpose
in aiming to 2 socialiee land values being to secure
ii equal rights to land in har mony with individual
possession and thereby to establish 4 egitality of opportunity to
live and to earn impossible under land monopoly but an
unescapable condition of progress with out poverty under flie law
of fs association in equality which is a natural law
of a sodal utility and b sodal morality objections to
the singletax are too numer ous for complete consideration here
some are frivolous some are disingenuous some proceed from misapprehension
but some are sincere important and at least apparently reasonable
most professorial economists are counted among objectors and the economic
atmosphere of the universities seems to be hostile yet tihe
objections lack both system and comprehensive ness most comprehensive of
all perhaps are those of walkers land and its rent
a book which had vogue for a time but is

mans essajs on taxation this chapter which is limited to
the subject tn its fiscal as pects is refuted in
chapter xiv of shearmans natural taxation following is a nummary
of current objec tions and answers l objection the single
tax would take private property for public use without compensation
anstser as land value is attributable not to individual industry
but to sodal progress and attaches not to in dustrial
products but to natural resources it is in fairness social

taking land value for public use without compensation to land

the fiscal principle upon which the sinietax rests that of
taxation in proportion to individual benefits derived from government is
false sound fiscal principles re quiring taxation in proportion to
each taxpayers atnlihr to pay ans a taxation in proportion
bility to pay is a principle of arbitraiy proportion to
governmental benefits 3 obj taxation in proportion to governmental bene
fits is impracticable the benefits being too multifarious and subtle
for financial measure ment ans a as land values financially
reflect all ejovemmental benefits taxation of land values is in
proportion to benefits b it is at any rate in
proportion to financial bene fits which is the crux of
the matter 4gt obj the tax would be shifted from
land owner to tenant in higher rent afts this is
a unthinkable with reference to unimproved land and b since
unimproved land would glni the market under pressure of burdensome
taxation all land would tend downward in market value s
obj ummproved build ing sites do not need the governmental
pro tection that tice and fire systems provide and whidt
buildings do need therefore upon the principle of taxation according
to benefits building sites rather than buildings should be exempt
from taxation for police and fire pro tection ans as
the value of building sites is higher with police and
fire protection tiian without and tne value of buildings mn
the grea i building should bear the financial burden 6
obj the singletax would produce public revenues in excess of
public needs ans probably not if schools highways and other
public necessaries and conveniences were adequately ovided and properly maintained
7 obj the singleiax would lack elasticity and there fore
be unadaptable to balanced budgets ans a this possibility of
disadvantage would be outweighea by manifest advantages b it might
be obviated by estimating public expendi tures after instead of
prior to collection of the public revenues out of which
they are paid c estimates of aregate land values for
a fiscal year in advance of expenditures are as trustworthy
for buet purposes as estimates of any other taxable values
or of all together d some canadian municipalities have for
aevgt eral years balanced their budgets under a poli of
land value taxation alone and with parent satisfaction for they
have been legally at lib erty to abandon the polity
at the beginning of every fiscal year e the problem
of balanced budgets is the same with governments as with
individuals namely to balance expenditures and savings in normal circumstances
against normal incomes in emergencies anticipating futurp income by drafts
upon savings and by temporaty borrowing ana as land values
are essentialbr social property and therefore the normkl mcome of
governments expenditures a govenuttent budgets should balance against land values
8 obj the singletax would yield insufficient local revenues for
the local needs of poor conummities atis a the land
values of every community are sufficient for strictly local needs
b the maintenance of local schools highways etc are not
prop erly local expenses these services being neces sa to
maintain the standards of state and national life as a
whole 9 obj the single tax would exempt investors in
labor products wiile taxing investors in land values though both
investments increased in value ans the latter would be taxed
because their in vestments are in values that arc prothiced
maintained and increased l the conununi and which attach to
the site of the communis a common heritage the title
to which investors hold as a government priwiege whereas the
investments of the former are in products of industry the
title to which investors hold from the proiducers 10 obj
all values are pro duced maintained and increased by the
com munity atis the statement is not tenable but irrespective
of that the values of labor proaucts attach to objects
of mdividaal production whereas land values attach to the natural
r sources and sites of production and of life 11
obj labor products are no longer ol jects of individual
production individuals be ing unable alone to produce anything in
our highly specialized industries ans tliis olgt jection springs out
of confusion of thought spedaliied and individual industry not beii
esaentiallv different since every specialist con tributes nis labor individually
so that though millions cotgtperate to produce for instance a

would be class taxatioa ans a to take by taxt
tion for public revenues prorty that is legally owned by
one class but which morally belong to allj would not
be class taxation but common taxation b it is exemption
of such property either in whole or in pait thereby
necessitating taxation of legitimate pnvate properly that is class taxation
13 obj it is impracti cable to distinguish land iues
from improve ment values ans a not with reference to
imimproved land b unimitroved land affords a reasonaible basis for
calculating the land value of neighboring improved land c the
land value of bmlding lots is easily distinguishable with approximate
accuracy from the value of their bmldinks d the value
of mineral deposits is easily distinguishable with approximate ac curacy
from the value of their operating plants egt uie land
value of farms is as a rule so low relatively
to their improvement value that error would usually be negligible
f literal accuracy of calculation is no more vita to
this fiscal policy than to any other and g un
avoidable error would be less unfair to lax payers and
leas injuriotis to the community 14 obj the singletax would
relieve great mosqred interests by placing all governmental expenses upon
landowners ans a no land would be taxed unless it
were valuable irreqcctive of its improvements and b valu able
land would be taxed only in proportion to its value
irrespective of its improvements c as moneyed interests diepeud for

titles to mineral deposits natural r powers google bihglxtax grazing

monopolies they would be more heavily taxed than they are
now while d landowners who are also land users working
farmers for instance would be taxed less heavily than now
is 06 the single lax would not benefit wageearners ans
a by making the holding of land out of use
unprofitable and the use of land profit able the singletax
would stimulate demand for wagceamen thereby promoting a tendency to
steady employment at increasing wages and b by discouraging monopoly
of idle land it would tend to make such land
common thereby expanding and maintaining opportuni ties for profitable selfemploymenl
16 obj to take all land values for public revenim
whether by taxation or otherwise would be unjust and justice
is the prime consideratioil ant a the singletax stands or
falls by the test of justice b as land is
a common herit age which cannot be continuously monopoticed without
continuous injustice to the uudless irrevocable titles to land are
indefensible c as any private titles to land are defensible
on upon the ground that social utility requires pri vate
possession land titles are in the nature of public trusts
which are violated when possess ors interfere with the best
use of the landi they so possess d such possessors
are there fore in justice estopped from objecting to land
value taxes that would encourage best use e as land
values are in the nature of com munity earnings private
ownership of land values cannot in justice be eranted in
pergt petuity f as private title to land and private
ownersnip of land values are dependent upon arbitrary governmental giants
and not tipon moral sanctions these grants are in justice
sub jcct at all times to revocation revision or ex
clusive taxation g as it is both impolitic and unjust
for governments to tie up their fiscal powers in igterpetuity
land titles are at all times subject both as matter
of public poucy and as matter of social justice to
taxation in kvemmental discretion h to assert that id grants
cannot justly be revised revoked or taxed by general rule
without compensating grantees or their successors is in effect to
as sert that it cannot justly be done at all
for just rights to compensation rest necessarily upon just rights
to that for which the compen sation is exacted fiscal
measures tenting toward the single tax have been adopted for
local purposes in several countries beginning with new zand this
instance dates hack to a period just before the publication
of henry georges progress and fovertygt but several years after
the publi cation of his our land and land policy
it came about under the leadership of sir george grey
who subsequently declared himself to be in full spatby with
progress and poverty as with nearly all the instances that
have followed it the new zealand reform was not called
the singletax nor adopted is what would now be so
known but it involved the same prindple and in degree
the same sodalidng purpose this may be said also of
the land value fiscal system which has been adopted for
local revenue purposes by municipality after municipality in new zealand
since 1996 until they aggregate nearly a hundred includinz wellington
and christctaitth it may be said also of the municipal
systems of australia ni which taxation for local revenues varies
from rising percentages on land values to land values exclusively
in the german colony at kiao chou china a system
of public revenues from land values exclusively was adopted in
1899 though crude and complex in comparison with the singletax
this system accords with single tax principles both fiscal and
social it is sup posed to have suggested the unearned
increment taxes of germany and the preceding local systems of
land value taxation in german municipalities that originated in 1893
both of which also crude and complex in comparison with
the singletax have singletax tendencies and somewhat of the singletax
motive al though the british measures of 1909 for land
value taxation were not singletax measures dis tinctively nor at
all except in minor degree th were supported by singletax
organizations ana were denounced as singletax measures by the opposition
some of the municipal ilies of canada have made pronounced
advances toward the singletax as a fiscal refoim vancouver tak
ing the lead in 1905 although these advances were not
made in the singletax name they were promoted by singletax
agitation and while the tax limits are too low to
effect the socializing purposes of the singletax its fiscal desirability
seems to have been demonstrated by the fact that the
municipalities being free to abandon the system with every recurring
fiscal year nevertheless readopt it annually in the scan dinavian
countries influential agitations toward the singletax have been reported notably
in denmark where a general small farmers move ment the
cottagers has pnomoted a strong favorable policy in south america
especially in argentina the singletax appears to have the support
of popular governmental influences and much in the revolutionary proposals
in mexico indicates a drift toward singletax ideals there local
option or home rule in taxation such as is freelr
allowed to canadian and australasian municipalities and less freely in
gennany has been a favorite method of sin gletax agitation
in the united states since 1889 when it was proposed
by thomas g shearman and approved by henry george the
earliest efforts in its behalf were made in the new
york legislature in the early ws but without success among
more recent efforts two unsuc cessful referendum campaigns in california
1912 and 1914 are notable the issue of each was
home rule in municipal taxation but the controversy turned upon
the singletax because it was popularly understood that if home
rule were granted it would be followed by singletax agitations
for local revenue purposes the favorable vote was large on
both occasions and larger on the second than on the
first oregon cstablied home rule in county taxation by referendum

in adminis trative operation in the state irrigation districts of
california the earliest distinctive singletax experiment in the united states
was begun at hyattsville md a suburb of washington d
c taking advantage of a state law permitting municipalities to
attract industrial enterprises by exempting them for a time from
taxation the hyattsville council adoipted the singletax for iocal revenue
purposes in 1892 but its action was abrogated by the
state courts in 1893 as unconstitutional not long after the
hyatts ville experiment a singletax colony or enclave to be
located in alabama on mobile bay was organized in iowa
out of its land values this enclave known as fairhope
has for nearly 25 years maintained itself and paid the
general taxes levied upon its inhabitants it is man aged
more in accordance with land nationaliza tion than singletax methods
but the principles and purposes of land nationalization and the
singletax are essentially the same another enclave arden was established
in delaware in 1900 since that time a third enclave

sinn fein shin faneiourselves an irish party founded about 190s
whose policy mav be described as at once the most
extreme and the most moderate form of nationalism it is
the most moderate because it aims at uniting irishmen of
all creeds and classes on a conmon platform or a
progressive series of common platforms for irish ends the party
or move ment as it has been termed aims at
the encour agement and support of the industries and the
institutions of ireland and he revival of the gaelic tongue
as a medium of intercourse among the people of ireland
its policy has been summed up by one of its
founders as national self development through the recogni tion of
the duties and rights of citizenship on die part of
the individual and b the aid and support of all
movements originating from within ireland instinct with national tradition and
not looking outside ireland for the accom plishments of their
aims sinn fein is simply then the gaelic for ourselves
which after all is the working molto of every government
and corporation in the modern world trusts and tariffs are
sinn fein applied to the industrial world the workings of
empires and chosen peoples are pure sinn fein the sinn
fein party regards ireland as being of right a dis
tinct nation and believes in establishing in irelands capital a
national legislature endowed policy was one of passive resistance as
a sub stitute for physical force and this has meant
in substance the laying of a boycott on every thing
english the economic reorganitation of ireland by its own people
on a purely irish basis the non recognition of engiisnroade
taws and the nousupport of english institu tions in ireland
it ss in elt to the people of ireland buy

i terms of the renunciation act of 1783 which she
laid it down that the rit claimed by the people
of ireland to be bound only by laws enacted by
his majesty and the parlia ment of diat kingdom is
hereby declared to be citabhshed and ascertained for ever and
shall at no time hereafter be questioned or question able
sudi is the message of sinn fein con sidering the
industrial revival as a political weuon sinn fein recognltes in
naitonality some thing much more wonderful and even necessary than
politics it holds however that nationality most have its poutical
phase and expression and that no nation ever yet became
exuberantly itself exdwrantly a ouag of beauty and use in
the family of nations unlets it was politically free its
aim as a poutical organiradon is con sequetitly the independence
of ireland and a a means t6 that end it
proposes tht destnkliaa google of the machinery of foreign govenuncnt
in ireland not that it is principally a destruc tive
or war policy nationalists are anxious for peace according to
mr arthur griffith the political thinlcer of genius who edits
sinn fein the party organ and who originated the sinn
fein policy in the columns of the united irish man
but before terms of peace can be discussed he continues
in a phrase reminiscent of tohn mitchel england must take
her one hand away from irelands throat and her other
hand out of irelands pocket in other words let ampiglaiid
observe e terms by which she bound herself in the
renunciation act of 1783 as quoted above thus far we
have stated in this article what may be termed the
official altitude of sinn fein during the first decade of
its ex istence in its second decade the movement ap
pears to put very little trust in legal and con
stitutional arguments and claims irelands right to be a separate
and free nation as a right given by god without
troubling about its other as pect as a right confirmed
by england all sinn fciners are agreed to work on
a common plat form for die independence of ireland the
mini mum interpretation of indtpendence beini that which is laid
down in he constitution of 1782 and the renunciation act
of 1783 ireland it declares must no longer send representatives
to the british parliament to plead to inditlerent cars the
cause of irish freedom since to do so is not
only usdess in practice but is an ap krent acquiescence
in the terms of the act of lion moreover it
holds that for irishmen to attend in a foreign parliament
and to take an oath of allegiance to a king
who b no longer the head of a free irish
constilutioil but a symbol of foreign conquest is a tie
ana an act of national dishonor irish politics ac cording
to the sinn fein ideal must not be al lowed
to rest on a national falsehood which in the 19di
centun did so mudi to corrupt and confuse the political
thought of the country but must be placed on the
far securer base of truth and honor and reason the
movement mands for the building up of truly irish indus
tries with the production in ireland of what ever articles
ireland might need and the stimu lation of foreign commerce
to this end sinn fein urges the establishment of an
irish mer chant marine and an irish consular service to
encourage foreign trade it advocates also the creation of an
irish civil service of irish national courts of law an
irish national stock exchange irish national banks and the like
1 these to be popular irish institutions com pletetv independent
of england it is one of the objects of sinn
fein to give the brains and muscle of the country
scope and happiness in the service of ireland sinn fein
thus proposes to build up the irish nation it has
set about organizing a great national passive resistance movement to
oppose the britiui government and british influence at every point
of vantage tliey have gained in the country fiscal educational
industrial leg literary dramatic artistic ireland it says has too
long met england on battlefields wbidi england herself has osen
the floor of the house of commons and the field
of war let ireland now choose the place of battle
and let k be the irish school the irish faory
the irish shop the irish home the iritfi farm the
irish church the irish theatre pbih and sinn feiners have
no doubt that a new and heauliful individuality will be
added to the family of nations prominence has been given
to die aims and professions of sinn fein as a
school of nationausm vrith which the future will have to
reckon it aims at building a nation to include all
the races and creeds and ranks that inhabit ireland it
answers the argument that ireland is too small and too
poor to be an in dependent nation by pointing to
such nations at switzerland denmark greece sweden nor way rumania
of less area population and revenue sinn fein certainly has
brought intellect imagination and constructive ideas into irish politics to
a degree unparalleled since the days of the young irelanders
of 1848 it remains to be stated here that the
rebellion of april 1916 was not entirely the work of
the sinn fein party but the result of the continued
preaching of the fenian doctrines up to 1916 sinn fein
bad put forward only one candidate for an irish constituency
and he was over whelmingly defeated ttie irish question waa
shelved for a time by the british cabinet on 27
april 1917 lloyd george proposed an irish convention to settle
the irish question promis ing that if there developed a
substantial major ity for home rule within the convention his
government would legalize the recommendations upon by all but 19
ulster unionists and an april 1918 lloyd geoie held that
the 19 dis tenting votes out of 100 showed a
lack of sub stantial agreement and stated that irelands case
would thereafter be treated as a purely british question on
17 may 1918 dublin castle the centre of the english
bureaucracy valera arthtir griffith and numbers prominent sinn feiners were
arrested and sent to england to be confined during the
kings pleasure when several days passed without either arraignment or
trial of any of the prisoners a general demand arose
that the government disclose some proof of the alleged germansinn
fein plot although the labor party many liberals and the
irish nationalists and the press demanded that evidence of the
plot be produced the government remained silent in this connection
nothing is more significant than the statement of lord wim
bourne former lordlieutenant of ireland that throughout his regime he
had discovered no sign of the allegeu plot and asserting
his belief that satisfactory evidettee of its existence could not
be produetd the sinn feiners men and women were confiiied
in england until march 1919 without arraignment without the production
of one single piece of evidence gainst them and were
denied the rigjit of counsel by the end of june
1918 conici d google sinnett sinus tion and home rule
measnres were formally abandoned and the government in ireland ran
its course to the elections of december 1918 the sinn
fein parly went before the electorate on the definite proposition
of an independent irish republic and the total separation of
ire land from the political system known as the british
empire at the polls the sinn fein victory was overwhelming
out of 32 coun ties its candidates ran unopposed in
22 in ulster it carried donegal monahan and cavan and
won majorities in fermanagh and tyrone carried a seat in
derry city the sup ksed stronghold of unionism it lost
only in iwn derry armagh and antrim of 101 members
the snn fein elected 73 the national ists seven and
the unionists 21 with this mandate from seventenths of the
people of ireland the sinn feiners proceeded to organize their
irish parliament on 21 jan 1919 the d4l eireatin irish
parliament met in dublin and called upon the free nations
of the world to support uie irish republic by reeogniring
irelands national status eamonn de valera was chosen president of
the irish republic he with arthur gritkth and count plunkett
were named commissioners to the peace con ference at paris

they reported that they found condi tions appalling men were

the pub lication of the report called forth much discus
sion vigorous denials and as vigorous demands for investigation after
a delay of two weeks the chief secretary for ireland
made his reply to the charges in parliament explaining or
denouncing the findings of the report but its authors insisted
upon its truthfulness and that an impartial committee should be

huron algonquian and iroquois diplo mats it had been convoked
for the purpose of brining to an eild a war
which had then been waged it was declared for more
than fifty years peace was finally concluded in 1624 but
in 1626 these iroguois tribes were at war with the
mohegan who had a palisade op posite fort orange albany
n y on castle dutch commander and his men killed
it is laid that some of the dead including one
or more of the dutchmen were eaten by the iroquois
the peace concluded in 1624 with the canadian tribes lasted
for only about 10 years for in 1634 these iroquois
tribes or five nations of iroquois inaugurated a farreach ing
policy which enabled them in subsequent years to overrun all
lower canada and to take the first steps toward the
entire subjugation of upper canada the algonquian tribes inhabit ing
the banks of the ottawa river were either thrust back
inland or entirely dispersed in 1636 the five tribes or
nations of iroquois be kan a systematic raiding of the
four federated wendat or huron tribes who lived around the
shores of lake simcoe and the complete political destruction of
this huron federation was accomplished during the summer of 1649
then there followed the defeat and dispersal of the tionontate
or tobacco nation tribe and in 1651 these iroqnois tribes
attacked and utterly defeated the powerful neuter nation the socalled
attiwendaronk occupying what is today the southern peninsula of ontario
canada and what is today western new york state as
far as the genesee river watershed these conquests made the
five nations or tribes of the iroquois complete masters of
upper canada and as a logical result they extended their
sway over the conquered lands held by the two tribes
last mentioned in what is today the state of michigan
then in 165455 the war with the erie took place
it ended with the complete political destruction of this intrepid
people for many of them became captives and were adopted
as citizens of the commonwealth of their conquerors while others
lied to other tribes for asylum these victories left the
hostile tribes in the susquehanna river valley the only formidable
enemies of the five mtions or tribes at this time
then in this five 1 hanna tribes especially the conestoga
place of muddy water who although supported by the maryland
authorities were nevertheless completely defeated and the valley of the
sus juehanna became a highway for troops of roquois warriors
going to attack the virginia and carolina tribes the tutelo
the sapona the achonechy preferably occaneechi the catawba the oierokee
and other southern tribes with whom they had already been
at war the conoy and the shawnee were also subdued
and broueht under the dominion of the five nations of
the iroquois league or confederation subsequent to 1693 the five
nations of the iroquois league attacked and defeated the illi
nois tribes driving some across the mississtpin river in 1722
the tuscarora became a sixth tribe or nation of the
league or confederation of the iroquois thenceforth these six tribes
or nations were usually called the six nations of new
york indians shortened sometimes to the six nations to commend
and to secure their rule in the valleys of the
susquehanna and the ohio rivers these six nations established a
vast colonial policy in pursuance of which they placed a
vicegerent on the susquehanna and another on the ohio to
oversee and to advise the subject tribes in purely local
affairs and to uphold federal law and to maintain federal
rights and the vicegerent on the susquehanna river was called
swatane by the iroquois and shikellamy by the dela wares
both names signify he enlightens us the vicegerent on the
ohio river was named scarouady by the iroquois and monacatuatha
by the dela wares the iroquois name signifies beyond the
sky the meaning of the delaware name is not definitely
known he was more fre siently however mentioned as the
halfking e lived first at logstown but in order to
avoid the french influence he withdrew to aughwick pa it
appears from the records that there were probably two in
succes sion who held this office in the ohio region
the first notice of such an official occurs in 1728
but of course this was not the historical dale of
the beginning of this unique native american policy the socalled
french and indian war in the fifth decade of the
i8th cen tury brought this policy to an end with
the defeat of the mohegan tribes on their eastern border
in desultory warfare 162640 the iroquois were finally able about
1720 lo bring the delawares under subjection they adopted them
into the status of women which by virtue of the
very dominant civil and political position of iroquoian women in
their own social organization was not at all the act
of humilia tion that most writers on this matter have
hitherto maintained the position of woman among the iroquoian peoples
was rather one of power and respect being in some
measure superior to that of the warriors and the chiefs
champlain was drawn largely by force of circumstances and ignorance
of the spirit of the iroquois tribes into committing tvo

and his alues de feated largely by the strange firearms
of the s nude in 1615 when be 11 an
in vading force of french and indians into the lands
of the five iroquois nations he ad vanced into these
lands to die region about the present site of syracuse
n y there he at tacked a palisaded fortification for
four days but after being severely wounded in the knee
by an arrow he and his baffled allies hurons aod
algonqiuan warriors were compelled to raise the siege this unprovoked
overt act the invasion of iroquois territory by these frenchmen
and indians aroused the undying hostility of these five nations
of the iroqonis leae against the french they afterward consistently
opposed die french at even step until the close of
the french regime in canada in 1764 thus these five
later ax nations became the firm friends of the english
who were at that lime often at war with the
french but this english alliance finally became the cause of
the disruption of the unity of the league as pointed
out elsewhere in these pages the pretentious raids into the
iroquois country in qiamplain de la barr cburcelles tracy frontenac
dcnonville and others never greatly embarrassed the activities of these
five nations so that they were never or at least
only tem porarily prevented from gradually extending their sway south
west and north among the native peoples their neighbors owing
to the fact that the policies of this league of
five nations or tribes were formu lated amended and executed
by five tribal com mittees of astute chieftains in the
federal coun cil the league with measurable success was able
to weather all these wars and changes but the war
of the american revolution ngt tured the unity of this
great instiltuioa sc of the tribes true to their longstanding
alliance with her espoused the cause of great britain while
a small minority composed chiefly oi the oneida and about
onehalf of the tusca rora with a few from other
tribes remained faithful to the american colonies this peculiar situation
resulted from a decision of the federal council of the
leagoe to remain neutral in the impending conflict as a
federa tion but nevertheless to permit each tribe to choose
for itself its own policy in the premises so that
as a result of the defeat of die ensh the
social organixations of the six nations of ihe iroquois and
their congeners were strik ingly alike although naturauy there were
note worthy differences in details on the whole many features
of their social organization were not very different from those
of like purpose among tribes having a similar social develop
ment but the social organization of the six nations of
the iroquois and their kindred tribes of the iroqiioian linguistic
family differed from those of most tnbes of other linguistic
stocks in being measurably more complex more expansive and more
ciuiesive in its parts a noteworthy difference between it and
that of most other tribes is the dominant posidon and
high public responsibility of the women who are mothers this
feature is a remarkable recognition of the nobility and the
sacredncss of motherhood tlie chiefship titles the lands and their
products and the lodges with thur belongings are owned solely
by the mothers of these people and these rights and
prerogatives are ably administered by these very mothers every candidate
for a chiefship is named at a conference of the
mothers of me ohviachira uterine family owning the dtle under
the premiership of the matron of the ohwachtra the selection
is then submitted for review and advice to the tribal
and to the federal councils respectively if the nomination is
found satis factory it is confirmed but if it be
rejected the mothers aforesaid must again meet in confer ence
in order to make another nomination if necessary this course
must be repeated until a satisfactory candidate is found the
review is usually perfunctory of course the nomination is sometimes
rejected alihouc the mothers naturally will present only such a
candidate as they feel will be a credit to their
ohwachtra after the institution of the league or federa tion
the candidate had to be installed into office by federal
officers nt a federal condoling and installing assembly this is
a limited democracy in which the suffrage for the nomination
of chieftains is confined to the mothers of the community
in the original stmcture of the league or federation of
the five later six nations no military officers were recogniied
by amend ment to the original instrument two of the
federal chiefs the one onondaga and the other seneca were
also made military officers but it must be understood that
these two officials could perform their military functions only out
side of the sessions of the federal council no federal
chief could go on the warpath be fore resigning his
federal chiefship which be mit resume on his return if
he was fortunate enough there were diree distinct classes o
dvil council chiefs among these tribes tbey were the clan
civil federal chieftains who while members of their local tribal
council were at the same time also members constituent of
the reat federal council of the league or fed eration
and the two classes of clan civil chief tains the
hereditary the office but not the person and the ment
or socalled pinetree chief who were the members constituent of
their own tribal council only but it must be noted
that there was no sudi officer as tribal chief or
chief of the tribe as an aggregation of dans known
to the league because the diief tain primarily represented only
the ohisaekim uterine family owning his title the ohtoa ekira
being a ooustittunl unit of the dan the dan is
therefore represented in council only by the chiefs of such
of its ohwachtra as may have chieftaincies but sometimes there
may be a clan in which no ohmachira may own
a chiefship title and so it may not have repre
sentation in council the league or confederation as an institu
tion or a form of government was an adapts don
of that of the separate tribes even as that dy
google ix nationft op thb iroqfuoh of die constituent tribes
was an evotntitm of that of the several dans whidi
composed ea lastly the government of the clan was an
adaptation and expansion of that of the several ohwachiros uterine
families composing t and the ohviachira or uterine family strictly
speaking was composed of the progeny of an cestral mother
and her female descendants reckoning the line solely tiirongh the
female blood persons of alien blood could be adopted only
into such a kinship group so the clan may be
defined as a permanent body of blood idn socially and
politically organized who de rive actual or fictional descent through
the female line only from a common ancestral mother it
is a fact that the less complex units of undred
surrendered part of their autonomy to the next higher units
of organiza tion in such manner chat the whole was
closely cohesive and interdependent the institution of a higher kinship
unit created new privileges duties rights and obligations this was
the principle of organization of the confederation of the said
five later six iroquois tribes or nations in nautical matters
the five later six na tions of iroquois were measurably
inferior to the huron and the algonquian tribes of canada
the canoes of the former were con structed of elm
bark and were of clumsier workmanship and they were no
match for the beautiful birch bark canoes of the latter
so it is found that in most of the canoe
fits mentioned in history these iroquois tribes were usually worsted
after the establishment of the league or confederation the five
federated tribes of iroquois lost no lime in maldng thei
united power felt the evidence of this fact is found
in the expulsion of the two wendat ter huron tribes
from their habitat on the nt lawrance river about the
close of the 16th century when the dutch traders estate
lished themselves at fort orange near the present site of
albany n y these iroquois tribes obtained firearms from them
and were thereby enabled to extend their conquests over practically
all the neigbborins tribes in such manner that their sway
was aomowledged from the tennessee to the ottawa river and
from the kennebec to the illinois river and lake michigan
the chippewa however checked their westward advance tiie cherokee and
the catawba and their allies effectually barred their further advance
southward while at the north they were much hampered by
the operatjoos and machinations of the french and their native
allies a list of the tribes against whom they raised
the hatchet is simply startling in brief they attacked more
than 28 algonquian tribes 12 iroquoian tribes and at least
three siouan peoples so that by 1664 when the engkih
displaced the dutcii at albany the conquests ot the league
of the iroquois or five nations had extended so far
that the swajr of these tribes was supreme over the
native tribes iroquois league made peace with the french and
their native allies who had attacked and burned some of
their villages both parties to this peace observed it for
a long period the league was organizing to pu its
conquests further south and west than diey bad prerioosly their
wars were waged primarily for the security of their homes
and their hunting lands and for the perpetuation of their
independence rity of their unique commonwealth the french in the
latter part of the 17th century made a number of
attempts through the jesuit missionaries to induce the people of
the five federated iroquois tribes to break off their english
alliance and to emigrate to can ada and to come
under french jurisdiciioa these attempts were so far successful that
numbers from the different tribes chiefly tbc mohawk and onondagaj
left their former alle ances and formed catholic settlements in
saint regis the bay of quinti oka lake of the
two mountains and caughnawaga on the saint lawrence river the
tribes of the league however made rieated unsuccessful efforts to
induce these emigrants to return to their former homes and
so in 1684 after real izing the futihty of their
efforts they declared these emigrants trtors to the peoples of
at leae ttie residue of the peoples of the five
nations occupied their original habitats nntil the sullivan raid in
1779 dislodged them and caused some to seek new homes
elsewhere those who did not emigrate live on reserva tions
in new york state and those who did live in
ontario canada the constructive principles of right and justice underling
the institution of the leafwe or confederation defined primarily the
rights and the obligations arising from blood kinship and affinity
their internal and their foreign polity was molded and guided
in consonance with these principles the motive for the in

righteousness and justice ltn giukwfia in directing and regulating personal

of the iroquois was a narrow tribalism which naturally regarded
and treated all other people as game or as animal
pests to be de stroyed for the common ood this
harsh although orthodox standpoini was not alto gether changed by
the universal principles of reconciliation and goodfellowship adopted as the
working forces of the institutions of the league or federation

league or federation prisoners were subjected to the most ferocious
cruelty unadopted women and infant prisoners were at times burned
as alleged reprisals for umilar treatment by their enemies yet
withal they were not a race of rude and savage

and profoundly imbued wttli a just reverence for the institutions
of their federal commonwealth and for its noted founders and

or tribes of the iroquois like that of all other
peoples of this linguistic stock consisted in the recog nition
and the worship of unseen forces and beings whose expressions
were embodied in all the environing objects and powers and
phe nomena and in many fictions of mythopoetic fancy which
directly or remotely affecting their welfare or causing their illfare
were relt carded as anthropic personages in fact as man
oeings endowed with human life volition and peculiar orenda or
magic power wbidt is the only impersonal concept of their
philosophy form is the logos or expreswon of creative spirit
this makes it clear that the people of these tribes
were not at all idolators ui the usual sense of
this muchabused term this religion however placed emphasis on the
punctilious performance of the rituals and the strict observance of
the customs and ceremo nies upon which these rest rather

century centary a period of eat art leonardo da vind
zad raphael died not far apart 1s15 20 the great
venetian painters the bel linis titian tintoretto veronese flourished and
such men as correggio and botticelli not to mention a
whole host of lesser lights lived from the preceding century
and did some of their best painting which has always
been an inspiration architecture decayed to some ex tent but
it was in this centun that michel angelo built the
great dome oi saint peters at rome and some at
the finest italian palaces were planned and constructed sculpture under
the group of men from michelangelo and ben venuto cellini
to john of bologna achieved masterpieces that were to be
forever famous italy was not alone in this great development
of the arts or such men as jean goujon and
germain pilon were distinguished as sculptors in france and the
chateaux of the loire are enduring monuments of french architecture
and great beginnings of french paintings were made german painting
had durer and the holbeins and sculpture the visschers and
adam kraft in spain as well as in the netherlands
there came a fine initiative for the supreme period of
their painting which was to follow in the next century
only england was not touched by the art spirit of
the time though the response in literature in the mag
tuficent elizabethan period must be credited to make up for
it while it is not generally realized the renaissance evoked
a great litera ttire 35 well as a great art
in all the countries of europe the development of this
was some what delayed and occurs in the 16lh much
more than the islh century it included ariosto and tasso
as well as vasari machiavelli lorenzo dc medici and benvcnuto
celuni in italy marguerite of navarre and the pldades ron
sard rabelais and montaigne in france cer vantes and lope
de vega with saint teresa and the great mystical writers
in spain and camoens in portugal the culmination of renaissance
literature came in the eticabethao period in england michelangelo poet
as well as artist died just two months before shakes
peare was born and the two men are comple ments
of each other at the extremes of cultural europe the
teutonic countries presented at great development of scholarship though not
of original literature the art of the 16th century is
however its beatest chapter it contains all the work of
aphael the greater part of that of michel angelo not
a little of leonardo da vind moat of titian and
all of tintoretto and veronese 1 number of men who
very first rank raphael has been called the greatest painter
of all time and while modem art criticism has discounted
that flattery scarcely any one would be ranked above him
when he died at the age of 37 he had
reached distinction as an architect and archaeologist aa well as
a painter narrow specialism was ex tremely rare in the
renaissance and many men did many things well titian is
one of raphaels great rivals some of his madonnas are
among the most beautiful in the world delacroix de clared
that he came closest to the spirit of an tiquity
another great painter of the time whose work is growing
in appreciation in our time is correggio leigh hunt declared
him the most skilfnl artist since the ancient greeks in
the art of foreshortening he was master of every technical
device in painting and this was a time of fine
technique tintoretto has been restored to modem estimation by ruskia
paok cag liare known as veronese was a master of
decoration and no decorative painter has equaled him in the
effective use of color it is easy to trace art
decadence in the century but not difficult to understand it
once it is appre was painting the mona lisa and
fra bartolomeo had just come under the influence of the
venedans and the spell of their rich color it would
have hecn almost impossible to expect that painting could be
maintained on any such high level as all this indicates
the century witnessed the career of the man often declared
to have been the finest intellec tual and artistic genius
who ever lived michel angelo buonarotti he ts the most
distin guished of sculptors since the greeks some of his
painting rivals that of the very greatest painters his decoration
of the sistine oiapel made him forever famous and has
been uie subject of reverend study ever since as an
architect he is undoubtedly one of the worlds supreme geniuses
in construction without steel or steam or any mechanical aid
except a mule and an indined plane he built the
great dome of saint peters one of the architectural wonders
of the world meant to be seen as the first
object visible in rome to the travelers who in the
old day came over the mountains in carriages or on
horseback 20 miles away it looks more like a work
of the creator tlian of the creature this greatest of
sculptors paint ers architects has written sonnets that have only
been equaled by dante and shakespeare and have never been
surpassed in every mode of xsthetic expression he was a
master in the highest sense of the word after having
worked hard all his life he lived to be nearly
90 in the full possession of his faculties his personal
diaracter is equal to his genius he was a deeply
religious man who all his life had been well known
for his thought fulness for others he left a sum
of money in his will the income of which was
to be given for the love of god to the
modest poor one of his sonnets is a prayer that
he may not let himself become so occupied with the
mere trifles of life as to foit that it is
a preparation for another vittoria colomia declared that those who
ad mire michelangelos works admire but the smallest part of
him the artist is often a dis appointment after his
works michelangelos personality had just the opposite effect at the
end he declared that life which had been ven us
without our asking had wonderful possibili ties of good in
it and death which came un summoned from the same
providential hand could surely not prove less full of blessing

in our the most fascinating character of the century whose
work has lived on after him and has deeply influenced
the after world is ignatius of loyola a spanish soldier
wounded at the siege of pamplona by the french in
1521 he had his leg rebrtcn when it had healed
in bad position bearing the awful pain in those pre

to as conclusion that life was only worth living trhea
lived in imitation of the godman amidst many almost incredible
difsculties for mon than a doien years he formed his
character by spiritual exercises took up the study of gram
mar in a class with little boys supporteo hiingt self
by beggiog as one of the beggar students of the
time and gathered around him at the university of paris
a group of seven men who iit 1534 took their
vows with him as membera of the company of jesus
with true spanish chivalry their first object was to win
over the holy land from the infidels by gcnug to
jerusa lem and converting it prevented by war from doing
this they became teachers and mission aries in italy their
seal was so great and yet o reasonable they were
so absolutely unsemsh and had a charm that attracted so
much atten tion that they accomplished wonders the pope received
them wtth kindness and gave them provisional confirmation of thdr
rule pope paul iii had insisted on limiting the munber
of religions orders because of atiuses that had arisen in
them but after reading ignatius rule he decred the finger
of god is here gave them the fullest confirmation and
in 1543 they were acknowledged as one of the religious
orders of the church the jesuits thus simply founded proved
to be one of the creations of that great period

and then made their ntonarchs the head of both church
and state cujui regio ejus religxo there had been unfortunate
abuses within the church and many felt lial these could
not be corrected without breaking away from rome a number
of deeply religious people followed luther out of the oiurch
for this reason po litical motives and the confiscation of
the prop erty of the church and of the religious
orders helped the movemenl sweden affords a typical t3mple of
this most of this property had been held in trust

which followed social organieation for the benefit of the poor

attendance was smaller i intellectual life declined erasmus there was
less academic freedom paulson luthers i doctrine of liberty of
jument and personal interpretation of ac scriptures soon led to
a multiplication of sects each bitterly opposed to the others
calvin in switzerland and knox i in scotland are as
difficult to estimate properly as luther they too gathered rotind

in religion rev dr briggs sug gested that there were
other and greater re formers in the century than these

of the greater ref ormation that was impending luthers move

church which was directed by the coun cil of trent

of the faith for writing against luther broke with rome

brought about a great reawakening of personu religion and aroused
the clergy to an ampler sense of their duties in
leadersnip with regard to their flocks religion had come to
be for a great many people a convention lacking those
personal elements of relationship between man and his creator which
foster the spiritual life the renaissance served to set the
intellect of europe rather definitely against religion thoii its great
leaders were exceptions lo this and a profound reawakening of
the spiritual life of the people was needed the movement
is too close to us even yet to be properly
appreciated in its entire signihcance though the world war lias
helped to its understanding the greatest accomplishment of the century

volume of stories the heptameron is still popular in every
language while her poems ltles mar guerites de la reine
marguerite are known to all lovers of literature she had
an ex tremely beautiful character and radiated the finest influence
over her generation in order to neutralize the evil done
by certain immoral stories current at court in her time
she retold them in literary form adding morals to them
like so many good people she had the idea for
the better by sweet reasonableness instead of doing good her
book has done barm most people read the stories and
not the morals or when they read both forget the
morals promptly while the evil suggestions remain mary queen qf

after 18 years in prison she was beheaded at the
age of 44gt she was crowned queen of scotland as

to the dauphin of france her husband be came king
as francis ii of france when she was 17 he
died the next year and at 19 mair returned to
try to rule the mrbulent scottish barons at 25 she
was imprisoned and was released for two wedcs only when
she threw herself on elizabeths mercy who kept her in
prison until her execution she lived m the most difficult
of times and this brilliant intellectual woman whose heart sometimes
led her astray is a type of the renaissance her
successful rival for the throne of england for on queen
marys death mary of scots had claimed the english throne
as well as elizabeth is a greater genius without heart
she had the discernment to gather around her the men
who laid broad and deep the founda tions of modem
england and its colonial em pire the good queen bess
of traditional history has suffered severely from modem historical research
she was a woman of great administrative ability but of
lamentable per sonal character prescott say of her she was
haughty arrogant coarse and irascible while with these fiercer quahties
she mingled deep dissimulation and strange irresolution she was desperately
selfish incapable of forgiving not merely a real injury but
the slightest af front to her vanity and she was
merciless in exacting retribution she had her fathers tudor character

education in the century wa anla of merici a young
woman of the lower middle class of a small town

women but all women needed to be edu cated in

those around them for the best she establied a little
community for die teaching of girls under her direction this
movement spread and she wrote a rule for the women

the most impottant historical event of th llsth century is
the battle of lepanto 1571 which marked the definite defeat
of the turks and put a period lo the long
fight between christians and mohammedans which had been in proeress
for nearly a thousand years pushed out of spain and
hailed in the balkan region the mohammedans had gradually acquired
do minion in the mediterranean sea had taken cyprus and
almost succeeded in capturing jfalta from the knight hospitallers who
de fended it with a dauntless courage which finally gave
them the victory something had to be done to stay
their progress thousands of christians were being captured every year
by turkish pirates and field as slaves in the citie
of the barbary coast or even being sold into the
east the turks were making incursions on coast dties with
great destruction and loss of life under the inspiration of
pope pius v an alliance was formed between the venetians
and philbp ii of spain whose commerce had suffered most
and they gathered an immense fleel don juan of austria
phillips half brother just then the pular military hero of
europe because of his recent success in a crusade against
the moors was in command the christians met the turkish
galleys in the gulf of lcpanto on the western coast
of greece and utterly defeated them this broke tfie power
of the turks on the sea forever lliough in the
next century the turks ad vanced as far as vienna
and besieged the city they were never the real danger
to europe that diey had been before lepanlo besides the
commanderinchief the one name now remem bered from the battle
is that of cervantes the author of don quixote he
was wounded while bravely fighting though on the morning of
the battle the physicians had ordered him lo stay in
bed because he was suffering from fever he was very
proud of his wound and tuced nothitw better than to
be known as the maimed soldier of lqtanto he was
after ward captured and sold as a slave among the
mohammedans this slave making continued though in everdecreasing importance until
the young american republic at the beginning of the 19th
century inflicted severe defeat upon the mohammedan pirates the bestknown
event of the century begt catiampe of the endless disputes
as to its significance is the massacre of saint bartholomews
day in paris 24 avg 1572 a great many huguenots
were murdered under the direction of the gov ernment with
sad disgrace to france catherine demedici the widow of henry
ii and the mother of the three kings who succeeded
each other rapidly at this time francis h charles ix
and henry iii is undoubtedly responsible for it since rankes
declaration on the sub ject most historians have agreed that
there was no deliberate premet3tion of the mauacre catherine was
angered at admiral cougiiy and in a spirit of revenge
resolved to do awi with him assassination by gov enunental
order was still not repudiated in most countries cohgnys assassination
was attempted 22 august but failed in her alarm over
the failure catherine worked upon the fears of her son
charles ix that the hugue nots mif in revenge bring
about counter al tadcs and had him order a massacre
in which coligny would sorely be included only the leaders
of the huguenots were to have been put out of
the way but in the mob spirit that ensued a
great many others were killed many rich people became victims
their houses being pillaged regardless of their religious opinions any
one a huguenot at this time the number of the
victims is not known ranke estimated that 2000 fell in
paris and larger estimates than this arc undoubted exaeratious the
mar tyro logic des huguenots mentions less than 1000 dead
there had been religious wars in france between the huguenots
and catholics in 1562 ls678 and lsw70 and it was
hoped that this might put an end to the civil
strife but it only in vetera ted it lyons toulouse
bordeaux and rouen all had mas sacres later than paris
toulouse 23 septem her bordeaux 3 october the lack of
simul taneity shows that the massacre had not been f
tanned but was a sudden decision qiarle x sent a
message to his ambassadors throii out europe coligny and his
followers were all ready to visit upon us the same
fate that we dealt out to them the french magistrates
ordered thanksgiving every year on 24 august in gratitude for
the timely discovery of the con sracy the pope told
that the french king and lus family had been saved
from a con spiracy ordered thanksgiving but when he learned
the truth he refused to receive the man who had
fired on coligny saying he is at the beginning of
this century the condi tion of the people generally may
be jued from conditions in england a generation be fore
fortesque lord high chancellor ves a striking picture of the
umcs quite incredible but for his authority he said the
inhabitants are rich in gwld silver and in all the
necessaries and convemences of life they drink no water unless
at certain times upon a religious score of which they
have plenty everywhere they are clothed throughout in good woollens
their bed ding and other furniture in the house are

mind and life easy and happy by the end of
the 16th century re uous conflict had sadly disturbed social
con ditions the rights of the people were trampled under

were lost such social institutions as the guilds hospitals and
various organiza tions for the care of the needy suffered

from ancient to medixval ctitirch gregorys friend benedict known as
ntirsia from the place of his birth is the founder
of monasticisni in the west he was the son of
a roman noble whose boyhood was spent in rome where
he attended school until to find a place of peace
and recollection at first he took a servant with him
but he found after a while that he needed manual
labor to keep him in good health attracted by his
gentleness and by the refuge from the madding crowd around
them which his little retreat offered many others came to
join him until benedict found that his own peace of
mind and heart was sacrificed so that he fled further
to live alone he learned enough in three years of
solitude to make him appreciate how much this retired mode
of life might mean to others for their personal develoiment
and so when the fame of his gentle sainlliness having
gone abroad he was asked to be the head of
a monastery he consented here he drew up his famous
rule which has served as the constitu tion of the
benedictine houses ever since and which authorities in the history
of law hail as a eeat foundationstone of modem jurisprudence
is monasteries were arranged to provide op portunities for prayer
re collect ion study be sides such labor as would
keep the body in good condition men of all classes
even of the nobility and of reigning famihes joined his
communities and gave the example of laboring with their own
hands they restored the dimity of manual labor which had
been under mined by the slave labor which had absorbed
all manual work at the end of the roman em
pire the monks gave ihcmseives assiduously to the copying of
manuscripts of the andcnt authors and the exchange of these
copies led to the formation of a number of monastic
libra ries through which the classics have been pre served
for us each monastery had a school attached to it
where the boys of the neighbor hood and sometimes even
from a distance were taught and sons of the nobihty
often spent some years in these monastic schools the so
lution of the social problems of the country places became
the special task of the monas they were besides centres
around which diere gathered a numerous tenantry who worked the
lands of the monasteries which were mainly gifts and bequests
from kings and nobles who realized how much good was
being accomplished by the monks and who hoped thus to
make up for evil in their own lives foundations which
would continue to do good monasteries quite contrary to the
tradition of lazy monks of a generation ago were really
hives of busy in dustry it is only since we
have estabhshed agricultural schools that the realization has come that
the old monasteries represent an an ticipation of these schools
goodell presidential address massachusetts agricultural school for the tenantry were
taught how to raise their crops to the best advantage
good breeds of stock and seeds which would grow to
the best advantage under the conditions were provided for them
the monastery itself diked ditched and drained the territory often
brouit water from a distance for irrigation it was no
wonder that the tradition arose that it was happy to
live under the crozier that is under the rule of
an abbot or abbess for the convents for women shared
all of the privileges and ad vantages of the monasteries
for men these monasteries became centres of trade and indus
try as well as of education and of letters they
cultivated particularly architecture and the arts of painting and sculpture
but also the minor arts and crafts so that beautiful
wood work and iron work as well as carving in
stone and stained glassmaking were developed to a high deee
while the convents accomplished simisr artistic purposes in lacemaking needleworl
tapestry book illumination and like occupations the benedictine nuns were
founded by the twin sister of benedict scholastica by name
and the nunneries came to be refuges for women who
wished to pursue an intellectual and spiritual life similar to
that which thf monasteries provided for the men at all
times in history a certain number of women do not
feel the vocation to be wives and mothers and to
assume family cares some ijrovision must be made for them
and the failure of such provision brings serious social evils
in its train for centuries these benedictine nun neries provided
an opportunity for these women and besides accomplished wonderful work
mrs putnam dean of barnard col lege goes so far
as to say that the modem college for women has
not as yet provided op portunities for the exertion of
womans influ ence equal to those given her by the
benedictine nunneries in the middle ages we know al most
nothing of the life of saint scholastica except the famous
story told by no jess an authority than pope saint
gregory i that when she came to die and her
brother who was with hef was about to leave in
order to keep his own rule that no one unless
compelled should stay out of his monastery over night saint
scholastica prayed that he might be kept near her and
a great storm arose which prevented benedictine from leaving her
side until after her passing her convents like the monasteries
of saint benedictine are still in existence au over the
world many of them very flourishing and all engaged in
good work the word nungt originally natina or nanna was
a form of the word mother because these women who
denied themselves personal maternity be came the mothers of the
needy all around them as the result of the large
number of slaves which had accumulated in roman times the
middle ages began with the very serious handi cap of
an immense problem of serfdom dur ing the first century
of the christian era when rome had a population of
about 2000000 it has been calculated that about 100000 of
them were slaves this state of affairs grew worse with
time the condition was not so bad in country places
but opportunities for becom ing freemen were much commoner in
urban than in rural life though everywhere progres sive individuals
were able to secure their tree dom in one way
or another the defeats of the barbarous peoples in preceding
centuries led to the capture of many prisoners who were
made slaves and these were distributed through out the country
places and thdr descendants were serfs by this was meant
that they were v google sixth century bound to a
contfilion of service diough dieir masters were bound also in
certain obugations toward them these serfs went with the land
whenever it was transferred and as die land was divided
into manors or villas latin for a country estate they
were called villains this word afterward became villain in our
sense of rascal because serfs who ran away from their
masters so often found themselves under the necessity of making
rtieir living as best 4ey mighi by iheir wits or
even by violence the serl belonged to the la bnt
the land owed him a living in a certain sense
there fore he was belter off than the lowest classes
have been since the industrial revolution while some masters were
harsh a great many of them tried to make conditions
reasonable for the workers and persons of special talent and
energy who were able to make their own way coula
usually obtain their freedom if a serf were absent from
his masters domain for a year and a day the
master had no further claim on him the brighter boys
from the countiy went into the towns rose from apprentices
to membership in the guilds and thus secured their rights
as freemeo at this time no one was supposed to
have any rights unless lliey had been specifically conveyed to
him by some authority this condition of villainage con tinued
for centuries the conditions of it being gradually ameliorated villas
or manors were transferred by bequest or gift to monaateriei
or convents and the serfs on these were treated so
well that it came to be a tradition that it
was good to live on the domains of abbot or
abbess their children sometimes entered the convents and monasteries and
were pven the oppor tunity to rise some of them
became priors or abbots and sometimes bishops and occasionally the
descendant of a serf might be made lord chancellor of
the kingdom the presence of all these serfs or slaves
to whom the hard manual labor of the time was
entrusted made the doing of manual labor by others seem
dis graceful and it was not until the foundation of
the monks of the west with the provision of the
benedictine rule for manual labor by all that the dignity
of labor was restored it took centuries of christian effort
to brine about a definite improvement in social conditions in
this regard while benedicts foundation was gathering strength the 6th
century is full of the labors oi the irish monks

branch of science of the time the oneers who laid
the corner stone of western culture on the continent the
greatest of them is columba of lona s21s97 scarcely less

of pope gregory the great in his desire to carry
out a great missionary project among the angles or english

the king who had married the dauier of charibert of

exercise her chrisuan religion freely was con verted and his
people soon followed him quite contrary to the spirit sometimes
displayed bedc tells us that it was part of the
kings policy to compel no man to embrace christianity on
niristmas day 597 more than 10000 per one were baptized
by the first archtnshop of the english england was dius
placed once more in touch with roman culture the dviliiation

english conquerors returned with the christian faith green when augustine
landed he brought with him roman customs and as certain
traditions had own up in the british and celtic churches
not in accord with those of rome particularly as to
the date of easter and the form of ton sure
jealous rivalry ensued and it seemed for a time as
though there might be actual division a synod was called
at whkby 7th century and throu the influence of the
king the dis pute was brought to an end and
england was won to the roman side the characters of
the men among whom columba and augustine had to do
dieir mis sionary work is well illustrated in the poem
imown as beowulf the first english epic which was written
probably gome time toward the end of this century beowulf
was a kins man of hygelac vrfio appears in gregory
of tours gesta regum francorum he lived in the early
part of this century and the myths that gathered around
beowulfs name were probably put inti nearly the form in
which we now have them in immediately succeeding generations and
represent our earliest old eni titerature the epic is pagan
and bar banc full of the lust of blood and
yet it has a stirring appeal to deep human interests
that ac counts for its survival the prose writers of
this first century of the middle ages whose works have
come down to us are more numer ous than might
be thought procopius a roman historian is often spoken of
as the last of the classic writers the end of

see ray skates and skating ice skates are made in

is to provide a support on which each foot of
the wearer can slide or glide on the ice this
method being by far the most rapid means of travel
over a frozen surface by the individuals own exertions skating
is undoubtedly of great antiquity as shown by early carvings
it is mentioned in the icelandic eddagt supposed to have
beoi written in the loth or lldi century primitive skates
were made hy tng smooth bones ai animals to the

metal runner this runner was gradually improved undl it became
a blade of hard steel vrith a slightly upcurved front
the wcmxienbodied skates of the 19th century were univenally tied
on to the foot with leather straps passing through slots
in the wood aa they were improved a sharp point
was placed in the rear of the skate to cut
into the shoeheel and prevent slipping later a screw took
ttu place of the point then came the clnbskattl all
metal with clamps for gripping the sole of the shoe
and a gripping mechanism to engage a steel plate permanently
fastened on the iwel of the shoe fancy skates were
made with king ornamental upcurve of the runner in front

skaters for hundreds of years the earliest record of a
skating club is in edinburgh scotland in 1642 the british
national skating association was formed in 1879 the american national
skating asso ciaiion was organized in the united states in
1884 and the canadian amateur association in 1886 there are
now also the eastern amateur skating association the international skating
qub of america and the international skating union of america
matches were held how ever long before the time lof
these associations the first recorded english match was in 1823
newburgh n y furnished the first american chamiaon skater charles
june who was the iecosjiizod speed champion for many years
in those dus the skaters used a short runner and
took lo strokes of 10 to 12 yards all this
was changed by the donohues of newburgh regarded as the
greatest family of skaters in the world having produced three
champions t donohue the elder first beat all comers and
educated his sons to the sport and j f dono
hue and t donohue jr in turn took worlds records
they developed the long runner skate and the short stroke
and j f donohue at tended the intemational meet at
amsterdam in 1891 and astonished them by his short quick
strokes of six or seven yards easily beating all figure
skating by gome called fancy skating appears to have had
its first great impetus in the london skating club founded
in 1s30 be coming favorably known as a sport other
clubs were organized in switzerland and northern europe and figure
skating became a popular sport of the welltodo in this

the skii is in progress the loss of substance being
coropensatea by growth from the vascular supply of the skin
is abun dant the numerous arterial branches emerge ing from
the deeper tissues divide and sub divide to form an
intricate horizontal network of vessels in the subcutaneous tissue a
second plexus is formed by division of radicles from the
first at about the level of the papillary bases from
these arterioles capillary loops extend into the papillk the distribution
of veins and venules for the return of the blood
is practically the same as that of the vessels for
the arterial flow the venous channels how ever arc considerably
larger for the passage of lymph juicespaces and lymph vessels
exist the former are mere excavations in the inter cellular
cemcntsubstance communicating with one another and eventually emptying into lymphatic
vessels these latter are channels with definite endothelial walls they
appear first at the bases of the papills as blind
terminals and by anastomoses from dense iilexuses in the corium
and subcutaneous tissues the vessels receive the lymph from the
juicespaces through openings between the nourishes the epidermis flows from
ihe papillaiy apices percolates between the cells of the rete
and returns by way of the interpapillary spaces tlie nerves
of the sldn are sensory oiedullated and vegetative nonmeduuated the
latter form a dense plexus immediately beneath the reie mucosum
thence fibrils as cend penetrating as far as the granular
ktyer and ternmnating either within or between the cells of
the rete spedaj nerves of non medullated variety known as
vasomotor nerves are dtstributed to the mtisclefibres of the vessdwalls
the medullated nerves are cpnfined to the papillary and subcutaneous
layers and are peculiar in that th terminate in special
endorgans three varieties of these are found in man the
corpuscles of krause the corpuscles of meisner and the paccinian
corpuscles while these differ in minute struc ture in rentral
all may be described as round or oval dodimk made
up of concentric layers of connectivs tissue enclosing the bltmt
or coiled termination of a nerve which enters at one
pole of the mass the first two kinds are found
within and beneath the paiu especially in sensitive parts while
the paccinian corpuscles occur in the subcutaneous tissue throughout the
body trophic nerves are present in the kin they belnr
to the veuuive system and aft nonmedtiltated husclebres of the
smooth or unstred variety are found in the corium of
certain parts especially the face the principal muscular structures in
tbe skin however are the arrectores pilorum these are smooth
musclebundles which arise frodi the lower portion of the walls
of the faairfol lidea and extend obliquely upward to be
inr serted into the pars papillaris of the coriuiii contraction
of these muscles produces ereetion of the hair or on
the glabrous skin the condi tion known as goose flesh
the pigment of the skin resides in the lower cells
of the rete mucosum it appears as black granules of
melanin within the cell protoplasm chiefly about the nuclei in
the dark races the pigment is found in the superficial
cells in some cases even in the comeum the tint
of the skin is also influenced by vascularity many theories
have been advanced as to the origin of the skin
pig ment it seems most probable that it is derived
from the coloring matter of the blood in the corium
and thence carried to the rete by wan dering cells
two kinds of glands exist in the adn the sweat
or sndonparons glands and the sebaceous or oil glands hie
sweat glands are found in the hjroderm and lower most

compose the lubute and many bloodressels are distributed in and
about the coils the duct has a lining of several
layen of cells and a more distinct investing mem brane
in the rete these disappear and throu the coroeum no
definite lining exists the sebaceous or oil glands are usually
found in connection with the hair follicles but m occur
where hair is absent as on the lips their seal
is the corium each consists of one in several sometimes
many pearshaped lobules lined with epithelium and invested with fibrous
tissue all the lobules open into a common glandcavity which
in turn discharges into the upper portion of a hair
follicle the product of the gland called sebum is formed
by fatlx degeneration of the epithelial ceus within the lobules
its extrusion is favored by the coo traction of the
arrector pilorum which oom presses the gland against the hair

the character of the rete cells from which the hair

which receives the bairroot it is ijsually obliquely set and
in detail of structure is rather complex a better understancena
of its for mation may be had if it be
remembered that the follicle is merely an invagination of the
skinlayers the outer portion therefore is made up of the
derma while uie inner layers are furnished by the epidermis
hence a dermic coat and an epidermic coat are distinguished
each of these is further divided into layers the dermic
coat into three namely an exter nal fibrous and vascular
a middle fibrous possibly muscular in part and an internal
thin and luiin the epidermic coat has several layers the
nonienclature of which is not en tirely fixed these too
are quite complex in structure and for practical purposes a

plays an important r6e in the reg ulation of bodily

upon the vasomotor nerves distributed to the bloodves sels of
the skin causes the latter to dilate an increased amount
of blood is thus brought to tbe skin where it

motors leads to contraction of the vessels a diminished amount
of blood enters the skin evaporation is reduced by the
dieckiag of sweat jecretion and bodily heat is conserved the
secretory and excretory functions of the skin are carried on
by the sebaceous and sweat glands the jjroduct of the
former a fatty unctuous material cannot be strictly re garded
as a secretion its purpose rather is to uioint the
hair and skin thus keeping the lat ter soft and
preventing heait loss by evapora tion and maceration of the
epidermis by moisture the sweat however is a true excre
tion and as organs for the removal of waste products
the sweatglands are most important various estimations have been tttade
of th amount of sweat produced in 34 hours the
average is probably about one and onetalf pounds this can
be greatly increased by mus cular activity by high cxierual
temperature and by the use of certain drugs it is
obvious there fore that considerable material can be removed from
the body through the skin a fact of great importance
in the treatment oi certain diseases the sweat itself is
about 99 per cent water die remaining per cent represents
a number of complex fatty bodies and mineral salts it
may be alkaline or acid in reaction acidity is in
part due co admixture of fatty acids from the seba
ceous secretioa it has been claimed that the sweatglands produce
no fat but it is erally accepted now that this
is not true since the secretion in the palm a
part devoid of sebaceous glands unquestionably contains fatty products the
skin possesses a respiratory function but it is comparatively insigiuficant
carbonic add gas is given o9 and oxygen absorbed the
rdative amounts of each as compared with those from the
lungs being 1220 of the former and 113s of the
latter the interchange probably takes place through the sweatpores the
skin also exhibits a certain degree of absorptive power this
is bitt slight in the undamaged skin if the homy
layer be removed or if the substance be forced into
the audular ducts absorption may take place readily especially of
certain substances diseasca of the skin abnormal or dis ettsed
conditions of the skin as of other oivlt gans are
recognized by manifestations called symptoms these are ail referable to
one of two categories subjective symptoms and ob jective symptoms

and manner of evolution which fact is the basis of
their subdivision into two gen eral classes elementary or primary
lesions and whidi at their inception present a certain type
the latter are those which are produced by pro gressive
alteration from a previously existing type the classigcation is not
entirely accurate however for under certain conditions a lesion of
a primary type may appear as secondary briefly described the
objective cutaneous diar acters which are considered primary eight in

besides recogmzing the presence and detailed appearance of the lesions

eluci date the coodition present in the etiology of skin
diseases many fac tors are operative for convenience of descrijy
lion ibese may be classed as internal causes and external
causes among mtemal causes hered ity may be mentioned first
while not mani cutaneous diseues are inherited the predisposi tion
to them may undoubtedly be passed on to the diild
this predisposition probably is due to some form of iissne
vulnerability to infhiences which otherwise might not suffice to produce
disease disorders of internal organs are fr quently effective hieir

feeble and defenseless as it looks it is mo efficiently
prdtected by the possession of a nanseons fluid the discharge
of which neldier man nor beast will wittingly provoke when

by means of a muscutar contraction ejects the contents of
its ana pouches frdtn the protruding orifices of a pair
of ducts with a force ihat carries bem to a
distance of lo or 15 feet so penetrating is the
evil ordor of this fluid that it may sometimes be

sweet and tender skunks usually raise from 6 to 10
kittens in a season if taken young they are easilytamed
and make pretty pets for they are cleanly in habit
and rarely emit their offensive secretion save when provoked the
families remain to gether for about a year and during
the coldest months of winter they all hibernate together in

a false and malicious oral defamation which tends to injure
or disgrace the person so defamed the chief difference between
slander and libel is that the latter refers to malicious
defamation expressed by writing printing or illustration the law draws
a wide distinction between the two ac tions words are
held to be actionable whether or not special damages are
shown to have accrued from the defamation if they impute
a criminal offense against the law the having of a
contagious disease or if they are such as would affeci
one injuriously in his profession or trade if the words
are not so actionable yet false and malicious the party
aggrieved cannot recover unless able to prove that he has
sustained some certain actual loss therefrom if the party charged
with slander prove that the words complained of are true
no action will lie for defamation whether or not the
words are actionable for in that event the law holds
them to be justifiable charging one with having committed perjury
has always been regarded as being actionable and in many
juris dictions it is so provided by statute words which
in themselves arc not actionable may in reality be so
through an allusion to some collateral facts or through being
used and understood in some panicuur sense and in such
cases dien the offensive sense is proved it is held
to be slanderous words in themselves slanderotis may be accompanied
by ecplanations which deprive them of that character there are
certain kinds of communications which are regarded as privileged and
are therefore not actionable as for example the statement made
in a judicial proceeding or where one com municates to
another a circumstance which he has the right to know
relating to a matter of mutual interest however this privilege
will not justify slander if malice be shown slander does
not exist if the injurious words are not uttered within
the hearing of a third person consult newell law of
slander and libel 1919 see dbfauatione libel slang probably of
coate orin with the norwegian word slengja meaning to fling
a mode of speaking or writing peculiar to some wirticular
place or calling the slang of the english tongue corresponds
to the french argot and the german saiivtrsptacht or rotweuck
the word slang is itself slang in origin it has
nothing etymo logically consid ered to do with any gipsy
word as has some times been asserted of obscure origin
its form nevertheless snests a connection with the english word
sting n the sense of this latter word as employed
in the phrase to sling that is tc sing reproaches
all colloquial words or phrases which have originated in the
rude speeoi of vagabonds and unlettered classes or belonging in
form to the standard speech which have aanired or have
had given them restricted capricious or extravagantly meta phorical meanings
and are therefore regarded as vulgar or ineleeant may be
considered as slang among slang names may be men tionecl
in general that class of words and phrases and senses
of words and phrases more or less artificial and affected
in origin or use which are not recognized as be
currency in some section of societj either as a means
of concealing secrets or as intentionally undignified substitutes for those
modes of ex pression employed by persons who have them
selves no propriety of speech slang is indeed used by
persons of every grade of life it changes with fashion
and taste and sometimes leaves permanent and recognized additions to
language it consists of words wtiich stand out predominantly even
in colloquial speech and the very sense of the word
slang implies the conception of a standard langu a nor
mal form of speech popularly regarded as cor rect slang
differs much from dialect for the latter is a local
or provincial form of speech characterized by some peculiarities of
accent pronunciation or grammatical usage which distinguishes it from standard
speech and a dialect as much may thus have a
slang of its own it is true however that shades
os into the ordinary coll and is thus constantly supplying
spoken language with new words but this should be no
reason why it should be simply confounded with the colloquial
in trum slang enters more or less into all collo
quial speedi and into inferior popular liter ature such as
novels newspapers and political addresses and is apt to break
out even in more careful writing as witness the criticism
of henry james in his notes on novehsts it is
noteworthy that most slang is euphistic it deughts in the
invention of synonyms for particular words and devises substitutes for
others which wellbred people for a variety of reasons dislike
or hesitate to use yet it generally correct in accidence
and syntax and does not disregard phraseological idiom as to
its structure and thus while slang not infre quently meets
censure as vulgar or unidiomafic the truth is that it
meets with disfavor on other than grammatical grounds the vogue
of any particular slang expression is apt to be very
brief and the constant use of slang tends not only
to vulgarize but to limit ones command of language and
here we probably find the rea son why it is
held in disfavor further slang words are not invented or
used because they are in any respect better than accted
phraseology but because ihey are different there are two principal
characteristics whidi taken together may serve to distinguish what is
properly called slang from other varieties of the ordinary colloquial
speec ing the ortunat urds and phrases google diction that
in some respects resemble it and these are firstly slang
is a conscious offense against some accepted standard of linguistic
propriely secondly slang words are deliberately sub stituted for words
of the vernacular just as the nickname of a person
is substituted for that persons name nicknames are indeed a
kind of slang and like other slang ma be used
for the purpose of concealing meaning from the uninitiated hearers
a mere vulgarism is not slang except ing when it
is purposely adopted and in the process acquires an artificial
currency among a class of persons to whom il is
not native by vulgarism may here be understood such col
loquial expressions which are rejected as un dignified by speakers
of a certain grade in the scale of culture ancient
greek and andent latin each had its slang its argot
see in tliis connection the plays of aristophanes the comedies
of plautus the satires of horace persius and juvenal and
especially the surviving serious iraent of petronius known as the
satiricon likewise every modern european tongue has its quantum of
slang from the 17th century onward it has been more
and more difficult lo distinguish between english cant of the
tliieves and vagrants and slang of other classes more or
lees characterized by disorderly habits of life such as pugilists
strolling players professional gamblers in brief of all such classes
as are addicted to low pleasures and vices the speci
men of the earliest english cant or peddlera french in
copelands the hyeway to the spyttel house 151 bears characteristics
that resemble closely those of the german rolweuch of the
same period an example of the latter may be found
in the old hi german liber vagatorum of 1510 and
it is easily seen that the most noteworthy point of
difference between peddlers french and 16th century germanic rotwettck lies
in the absence of those hebrew words from peddlers french
in which rot wlsck abounds in the english of hudibras
and the literature of england dating from the 18th century
slang is to be found a peculiar btowlh of the
19lh century is the socalled back slang current chiefly among
london coster mongers which is a cryptic jargon formed by
pronouncing words backward as in the phrase eno dnuop and
a flah for one pound and a half thirty shillings
when sir waller scott wrote the word slang itself had
apparently no vride currency and that author felt the need
of defining it for his public in one of his
works he seems lo have meant what is practically thieves
cant in using the word but nowadays one should understand
by thieves cant merely one species of an extensive group
of expres sions called slang consult scotts redgaunt let coster
mongers slang is thieves slang in which the middle vowel
oia word is taken as the initial letter so the
other letters or syllables are added to give it as
it were a finish thus lock becomes ockler and pitch
itchper slang and cant in particular as in the phrases
fliieves cant or printers slang or uie cant of any
craft or calling really designates a language within a language
and it is sometimes intended to conceal the thoughts of
those who utter it from the uninitiaied there is a
slang attached in this way to nearly every professioa and
occupation and different classes of society have their slang thus
there is a slaag of commerce of the army of
the racetract of the college and school of the stock
exchange of the prize ring of the ball fieli of
politics and even a slang of art and the minitr7
very often slang adopts technical langtuige to the general use
its expressions may be per fectly correct as originally used
but they be come slang when used metaphorically the gamingtable
the turf and all the varieties of fast or bohemian
hfe each has its own eccentric vocabulary and these vocabularies
are either identical with or in general character resemble the
slang of crimmal and vagrant some examples of slang may
now be noted a user of slang will cracterize a
feeble minded or silly person as having a screw loose
a slate off bats in his belfty off his tose
or as being cracked louched or dotty he will call
his child or wife a kid say corned pickled tight
stewed slued for intoxicated and use awfully as substitute for
exceedingly daisy with him will characterize some person who is
charming or some thing which is admirable and the user
of slang will announce the death of a per son
by telling one that someone has lddced the bucket cashed
in or hopped a twig to be angry means that
he has got your goat and he will allude to
the clergyman present as a sky pilot while in a
museum he will show you the latest potboiler and in
so doing he both names and stigmatizes certain works of
a habitual user of slang will likewise borrow words like
pan out from the technical lan guage of gold digging
or other pursuits of a similar character he will use
the word four flusher from the language of the professional
pokerplayer and he will use the slang ex sressions deal
walkover and up the ume in giving an account of
business in his vocabulary of praise and blame one will
find expressions such as ripping swagger stunning the cheese rot
poppycock and when he is in some dithculty he will
be in a hole in a box on his beam
ends or in the soup to extricate himself he will
use his head or nut thinkbox brainpan or to go
in public he will don his glad rags and appear
as a swell giddyboy or dude in this respect he
will resemble the older beaux bucks exquisites gallants sparks and
blades while in the stock exchankc one will hear him
speak of bulls bears lambs longs and shorts and from
the side of the priiering one will find him awaiting
to see a knockout and always willing to dis approve
of a blow below the belt and he will be
disappointed should one of the pugilists throw up the sponge
one recent contribu tion to the vocabulary of slang is
the word jazz which originated in the southern states and
means according to a users own defini tion to mix
things up and spread em on thick in other words
a medley thus it ap d google ers tbjtt nearly
every trade and every pro lion has a slang of
its own in the shape of a body of words
and expressions that serve as flippant and undignified substitutes for
stand ard speech the contribution made b foreign languages to
english slang although it is not to be dis regarded
is not to be overrated as to its extent there
are a few words boss from the dutdi baas dago
from the spanish dtego spiel and hum from the german
which may be named as of foreign origin the romany
or tongue of the gipsy gave english the words cove
jockey rau and pal which may be considered as slang
expressions and the english phrases not naif bad and a
very decent fellow are carefully considered slang siressions and represent
the rhetorical figure led meiosis there are it is true
words that are no longer slang mob humbug and tandem
are examples that were once so considered america has contributed
its quota to the slang of the elnglish tongue of
suui we might name the following expressions recom mended mainly
by their oddity scallywag absquatulate skeddaddle vamoose from sp vdmos
let us go and english has also diese substitutes for
standard usage to char acterize political life mugwumps gerry mander
carpet bagger as well as the older rump bare bones
parliament round head puritan and so on so politics also
has its slates wirepulling pipelaying lokrolhng and filibustering expressions sucn
as the foregoing stigmatized at first as fiure slang are
often in the end accepted as timate just as have
been the words poncy cob and the term slang itself
as the prevailing tendency of words in a language is
toward degradation of meaning one of the most frequently recurring
needs of eng lish is that of words of dignified
and serious intention to take the place of words which
have become vulgar through ignoble use and there fore it
may be believed that while slang has made its contribution
to the engush language still that contribution has been on

which as a result splits readily into thin sheets or
cleavage laminse in a direction at right angles to the
direction of compression according to sorby cleavage is produced in
auch rocks bv the re arrangement during compression of the
plastic particles comprising the original rock mass m such a
manner that their longer axes come to ue perpendicular to
the direction of com pression and that planes of easy
fracture were thus produced parallel to the long axes of
the particles this was illustrated by sorby with a cube
of day throu which mica scales or scales of oxide
of iron were sprinkled which was then subjected to powerful
compression and drying a perfect cleavage at right angles to
the line of pressure was produced and micro 5coigtic exammation
showed that the mica scales lay in the direction of
cleavage tyndall found by experiment that cleavage is more perfect
in proportion in which the cleaved material is free from
foreign particles such as mica scales and he considered that
cleavage was produced in homogeneous rocks except the vitreous by
the compression and flattening of the minute discrete granules or
particles of which all sudi matter consists the structure is
changed by the compression from granulous to scaly enor mous
vertical swelling of the rock masses re sults through such
lateral compression and this swelling is an important factor in
the formation of mountains ordinarily cleavage exists in rocks in
a po tential manner only the rock is cleavable in
a certain direction but no actual separation takes place this
however is rapidly developed when the rock mass is exposed
to atmospheric infiuences slates are quarried in solid blocks and
split up in thin sheets usually by hammer and chisel

the proportion of silica an analysis of common roofingstate gave

potash 470 magnesia 160 carbon 30 water 760 since slate
is in reahiy a structural term denoting the property of
easy splitting so characteristic of roofing slates rocks of almost
any composition may be indexed under this term provided they
show the characteristic slaty cleavage thus it has become customary
to speak of anthracite slate in which a considerable percentage
of carbo naceous material is present whet slates clay slates

prominent graywacke slates more or less arenaceous and micaceous slates

the viewpoint of the general public fresh meats are perhaps
the most im portant item in the whole range of
commodities which the individual is ever called upon to buy
yet from the viewpoint of packers profits the byproducts of
meat packing long ago out stripped dressed beef pork and
mutton as well as pickled meats of all kinds the
packer today makes little or no money on what are
known as carcass meals in the recent years of struggle
with rising costs livestock raisers have demanded higher and still
tender age of mariceting has constantly im proved on the
other hand there has been a de termined resistance on
the part of the consumer to the rising cost of
steaks roasts and chops as well as constant and widespread
agitation throughout the country for higher standards of cleanliness sanitation
and efficiency in methods of dressing refrigeration and distribu tion
of meats nearlt all profit blimitutted from dressed meampt esicient
and economical oper ation on a large scale has made
it possible for american meat packers to continue in business
in spite of increasing cost of livestock labor and all
material and equipment they have paid producers the highest prices
and have kept their own margin of profit down to
the lowest point consistent with safety higher standards of meat
products have been maintained a the other have each been
so jealous of middlemans profits that the middleman who in
this case is the packer has been forced al most
entirely out from a profit viewpoint in point of service
however the packer is still in evidence and tlie slaughter
cfressing chilhng and distribution of these dressed meats are stio
performed by him the outcome of such a situation is
that the butcher of today regularly pays the packer for
the dressed carcass a less amount than at packer paid
the farmer for the animal before it was killed dressed
chilled and shipped byproducts pay packers profits it will thus
be seen that on carcass meals alone die packer loses
money being obliged to maintain for the distribution of these
profidess perish ables an elaborate system of branch houses and
refrigerator cars this is not to say however that the
paddi business as a whole is devoid of profit only
approximately 55 per cent of the live weight of a
steer is represented in the dressed carcass in the remaining
45 per cent which is made up of blood hide
hoofs horns bones hair intestines glands and other items of
offal the packer finds opportunity to recoup himself for any
loss he may sustain on carcass meats and ensure a
fair return upon his whole investment in the early das
of the meat packing busi ness all of these items
with the exception of hides were discarded as of no
account they were at that time contemptuously referred to as

protect the public health in the city of new orleans
and to that end incorporating the crescent city live stock
landing and slaughterhouse com pany the act gives id this
company the sole right to land keep or slaughter any
cattle beeves sheep swine or other animals within the city
of new orleans or at any point or place on
the east or west banks of the mississippi river opposite
the corporate limits of the city included with this privilege
granted to this company and forbidden to all other persons
was the right to estabhsh wharves for the landing of
livestock and to levy wharf age on the stock landed
at so much per head iliis act was bitterly opposed
by the butchers and cattle dealers and after it went
into effect an action was brought in the district court
and an iiyunction obtained on die ground that the law
was unconstitutional when the case was tried ihe court suslained
the injunction and made it perpetual on the ground that
it was in opposition to the 14th amendment of the
united second state bill of rights freedom whatever 2 wajis

but a round sum on the vessels and b duly

8 all this is made effective by penal clauses imposing
fines etc the judge declared that this was not only
gainst the clauses named but surpassing police regulation was also
a bold and well contrived regulation of commerce compelung the
coveted trade to flow into the channel and leave the
tribute in the coffers of this private monopoly and as
such was in violation with both the pro ion in
the federal constitution giving con gress the sole power to
regulate commerce and the act of congress under which the
state of louisiana was admitted into the union this decision
with others some varying which had been given in different
district courts were the next year 1870 carried into the
su preme court of ihe state and there the case
was determined in favor of the defendant cor poration and
all persons enjoined from interfer ing with the privileges granted
to it under its charter the opponents o the company
thett look the case into the united states circuit court
asking for a perpetual restraining in junction against it this
was granted on the sole ground that the act incorporating
the com pany was in violation of the i4th amendment
of the federal constitution the court disclaim ing jurisdiction over
any otiier of the issues raised a writ of error
was asked for and ob tained and on it the
case was carried to the united states supreme court here
after be ing three times ared a decision was delivered
in 1873 recognizing the validity of the act and permitting
the exercise of the powers con ferred by it the
decision of the court on the various issues involved gave
the case its great importance it bad been contended in
the first ice that the act was invalid because it
created a monopoly conferring privileges on a few pei sons
to the exclusion of all others and depriv ing a
numerous class of citizens of the right to follow tlieir
usual employment on this point the court decided that the
act was within the police power of the legislature a
lgtower in upable of any very exact deiitiilion or limita
tion from the decision upon this point a minority composed
of the chief justice and two associate justices dissented the
objection had been urged by the comolainants that the act
vvas a violation 1 of the i3lh amendment of the
federal constitution by creating a kind of involuntary servitude and
2 of the 14th amendment because it abridged ihe privileges
and immunities of citliens of the united stales deprived the
plaintiffs of their property without due process of law and
denied them equal pro tection untler the law the court
held that che term servitude in the 13th amendment means
personal servitude and that the purpose of the amendment was
to guard against a continuance of slavery in any form
and that the amendment had not been violated by the
act under discus sion as regarded the 14th amendment the
court perceived and established the diseteuce google 86 slave coast
8lavsrt between a citizen of the united states and a
citizen of a state it defined the rights and erivileges
of these two classes of citizens tnd eld that only
a citizen of the united states was placed under the
protection of the constitution by the clause in the 14th
amendment the court further held that no other clause of
the amendment was violated the act of the legisla ture
of louisiana not being a deprivation of property nor a
denial of the equa protection of the laws within the
meaning of the amendment the minority of the court held
1 that the act of the legislature was of itself
a step be yond the police powers of tbe state
and there fore was void 2 that the act was
also void under the t4th amendment since it is in
the meaning of that amendment that all acts of a
state legislature shall respect the ecjuality of rits of its
citizens to follow the ordinary pur suits of life which
equahty of rights the minor ity held had been contravened
the decisions of this case are considered extremely important because

states but be cause of the interpretations of the clauses

by which certain persons slaves are held as the property
of other persons j slaveholders also the condition of a
human being who is held as the property or chattel
of another who is absolute master of his bodj and
service sub jecting him wholly to his will and domination
the system is one of great antiquity and was early
practised among tne hebrews it existed among the assyrians from
the earliest recorded times among the babylonians chinese egyp tians
and all the ancient peoples the pnmi tive religions appear
to have all sanctioned the obtained by capture often s
subject to cruel punishments and death the whim of their
masters the females were used without their consent and beautiful
girls and women were sold often at public auction the
slaves of the ancient romans were cither captives or debtors
who were unable to pay in rome the slave had
originally no rights he could be put to death for
the smallest misdemeanor slaves were exceedingly numer ous and latterly
almost monopolized all the vanous handicrafts and occupations those of
the cleric the doctor and tbe uteru man in cluded
in the time of augustub a single per son is
said to have left at his death over 4000 slaves
hosts of slaves were employed in the gladiatorial exhibitions slave
revolts occurred in 134 and 102 bc in sicily and
a revolt in italy led by the gladiator spartacus in
73 ba was put down with considerable difficulty slaves however
were often set at liberty and these freedmen were a
wellknown class in rome but it was not until the
time of the em pire that any great change took
place in the condition of the slaves augustus granted the
slave a legal status and antoninus took away from the
masters the power of life and death the early christian
church did nothing to suppress slavery and slavery and the
slave trade continued to exist for 1000 years in the
christian nations of europe that arose on the ruins of
the roman empire it was not until die 13th century
that the severity of slavery began to decline in europe
the koran ex pressly permits the moslems to acquire slaves
by conquest but this method at acquiring slaves was not
resorted to until the crusades previous to the crusades they
kept negro slaves imported from africa latterly the moham medans
began to obtain white slaves not only by war but
also by purchase rome being the centre of the trade
the motiammedans of the barbary states also detained while slaves
by piracy in the mediterranean the superiority of the white
races in war and the comparative helplessness of african blacks
led to the com mon tractice of invading african coasts
and capturing men and women during the 16th 17th and
18th centuries after slavery had become largely reduced in eurofe
it had a new birth in the american colonies of
european origin the portuguese were the first to hunt negroes
in the interior of africa for use as slaves in
the colonies the first shipment of negroes to the new
world took place in 1503 when the portuguese landed some
in santo domingo the first shipload of staves to the
unitea states was landed at jamestown va in 1619 from
that time to the 19th century a traffic in negroes
across the atlantic was carried on by all uie christian

abolished in 1838 20000000 ster ling being paid in compensation
to the slave holders but it was not abolished in

cling to the institution in 19ia slavery must be accepted
as one of the stages in the evolution of man
toward a recog nition of universal freedom early man was
wholly selfish and sought to dominate when a war of
conquest was undertaken the scarcity of valuable goods obtained was
compensated for by making slaves and menial workers of the
men and household drudges and mistresses of the women it
was a phase of the rule of might but the
institution carried with it the seeds of destruction for the

undermined and destroyed by the possession of google slavery in

at home were a senous menace but as the roa

natures so veo many slave masters were generous and liberal
in their treatment of dieir slaves not only caring for

who worked in the temples in warfare the slaves were
used as armorbearers workmen galley slaves cooks and sometimes as

was denied the right to marry a slave could be
examined as a witness only by the torture because it
was held that he would surely lie if not tortured
in rome many slaves were chained at night and galleyslaves
were nearly always chained to thdr work they were sometimes
driven under the lash to heavy work as in the
mines and fields in the later history of rome how
ever the slaves fared better and very many were placed
in conditions that enabled them to earn thdr freedom some

a slave liberty when they were grown other masters found
that it was finanaally profitable to encourage their slaves to

slavery in the slavic languaces the slavic languages form a
separate group of the indo european languages and are more
nearly re lated to the lettish lithuanian and prussian with
which they are frequently mentioned as the bal toslavic languages
thdr original habitat before the period of migration in the
4th century and the original tongue from which they have
sprimg are still a subject of specu lation the origin
of the word slav which first makes its appearance among
syrian and byiantinc writers some time before the 9th century
is equally undetermined it certainly is not to be derived
from siava fame nor from slovo word as assumed by
some slavic scholars but must with greater probability be connected
with the low latin clavms slave since spanish goths and
arabs received the neat bulk of thdr slaves and eunuchs
from russia and eunuch is in late greek kolo bos
asklabot the first slavic tongue to be fixed by writ
ing was the one adopted in the 9th centuiy by
the protoapostles cyril and methodius of the ndghborhood of salonikl
in thdr missionaty work in pannonia and moravia but it
is still an unsettled question whether this original speech was
bulgarian or of the moravian vari es hence the multiplicity
of names for it such as old bulgarian old slovenian
pannonian from the fact that it became the liturgical lan
guage for all those slavs who recdved thdr christianity from
constantinople it is also called church slavic it contains a
consider able number of germanic words and an ex ceedingly
large number of greek words in its vocabulary especially such
as refer to religious matters in grammatical structure it is
more primitive than any other slavic language pre served to
us for it has an aorist in the verb and
a dual both in the noun and the verb and
the earliest documents which have come down to us show
unmistakablv the presence of nasal sounds now quite lost in
all but the polish and an occasional bulgarian dialect on
account of these andent characteristics church slavic is put at
the basis of slavic philolo but it would be a
mistake to assume that this church slavic is the primitive
tongue from which the other slavic languages are derived for
the further history of oiurch slavic see russiah language the
russian literary tongue contains a greater proportion of church slavic
elements than any other related language which is the result
of the important part the church slavic played in russia
as a means for literary expres sion the history of
the russian language in modem times is treated separately but
here must be mentioned the fate of the ruthenian or
little russian especially since through the separation of the ukraine
it is likely to gain new importance if is a
distinct group of he russian dialects which in the 18th
century received literary polish under kotlyarevski and since produced the
great poet shevchenko d by google 90 slavic languages and
the storywriter kvitkaovsyaoenko in the 19tfa century its literary activity
was car ried away from the ukrdnc where it had
its origin to galici where at the universities of lemberg
and czemowitz it was permitted to develop freely but here
it fell under german and polish influence and almost led
to the for mation of a separate language inaccessible to
the ukranians who drew similarly upon the russian dictionary for
its new formations the ruthenian papers in the united states
nearly all of them of ukranian origin write in a
curious mixture of great and little russian now the formation
of the ukraine may change the aspect of the literary
ruthenian once more the modem bulgarian is phoneti cally very
ckisc to the church slavic but sranunatically it has departed
from it more lan any other slavic language it has
lost practically all declensional forms and thus stands to the
others in very much tlie same re lation that english
bears to the other germanic tongues the oldest document of
the bulga rian vernacular does not go beyond the 14tb
century but it was only in the forties of last
century that the first grammar of the spoken tongue was
written down by an american elias riggs after which it
was used at first almost exclusively by amarican missionaries in
the translation of textbooks since then it has fallen for
its vocabulary and style under the influence of the russian
literature the serboroatian language consists of three dialect croups which
are distinguished by the word used for what which is
respectively shto cka and kay the first considered to be
die most elegant is found in serbia bosnia herzegovina and
the litoral the second is spoken in northern dalmatia on
the islands in sofia and the adjoining territory of croatia
while the third is the vernacular o north western croatia
the greek catholic serbians used in the middle ages the
church slavic for literary purposes but this church slavic was
permeated by serbian exactly as it was rus sianized in
russia only at the end of the 15th century was
the spoken dialect of ragusa and the litoral used for
literary wodcs and under the influence of the italian it
reached in the 16th century its highest devekipment and that
period is known as the golden age of serbo croatian
literature in the 16lh and 17th cen turies the kay
dialect of croatia gained pre dominance the literary form of
the language remained unsettled until the thirties of the 19tb
century when gaj put the shto dialect of ra ksa
at the base of bis diction and called it yric
in order not to oftend any one by the choice
of a local name meanwhile the serbian vuk karadzich had
been using the spoken serbian in bis writings at the
present lime the serbocroatian is divided into the croatian of
the roman catholics written with latin char acters and the
serbian of the greek catholics written in a variety of
the russian alphabet the two literary norms differ in a
number of dialectic varieties but there has been a tendency
to bring the two together at least the serbian schoolbooks
print about one fourth of croatian matter and he croatians
pnve a simitar amount to stories of serbian authors the
slovenians of styria carinthia camiola and northern istria nearly all
of them protestants have since the 17th century used their
variety of the serbocoatian as a separate literary language and
developed a beautiful literary norm espe cially in the 19
th century under the poet preshem out of a dialect
of southern camiola bohemia began bo use the spoken language
for literary purposes as early as the 12th cen tury
and in the 14th century no other slavic language contd
vie with it in wealth of expres sion john hus
employed it in his theological discussions and under the influence
of the german church poetij a vast number of hymns
were wtitten in bohemian especially by the moravian brethem there
was also a consid erable activity in the poetry of
the romantic type in which it also followed german models
beginning with the 17th century bohemian fell into desuetude but
this time again under the influence of german romanticism dobrovsky
the father of slavic philology in the beginning of the
19th century resuscitated the older language of the moravian brethren
and nce then it has been used for all literary
purposes unfortunately bohemian is in poetry handi capped by its
accentuation because no matter how long a word may be
its accent as in the unrelated hungarian is always on
the first sellable whereas in russian bulgarian and serbian it
is mobile but in serluan there are really four melodic
accents which make the language very harmonious and musical in
the 19th century the bohemian dialect of the slovaks in
northern hungary for whidi it is claimed that it is
a transitional language between bohemian and serbian evolved a sep
arate literature the writer was fortunate in procuring in 1901
almost a complete set of this rare and quaint literature
amounting to some thing like 1800 numbers for the harvard
li brary slovenian and slovak appeal to a population of
less than 2000000 each which makes their existence precarious there
is however another slavic language called by the germans wendish
and in philology serbolusatian spoken in lusatia by but a
few hundred thou sand people and yet divided into two
distinct literatures differing somewhat in their literary norms that of
the catholics of upper lusatia and of the protestants of
lower lusatia after the russian the polish is the best
developed literary language of the slavs it made its appearance
in the 14th century when it fell under bohemian influence
like the bohemian and unlike the other slavic languages polish
appears fixed in form from the beginning in its vocalism
it resembles french on account of its nasal sounds and
italian on account of its soft consonantal utterance many of
the con sonants have four shades which demand the addition
of two diacritical marks and the use of z in
connection with the latin alphabet em ployed by it the
accent is nearly always on he penult as in itauan
at first the literary form fell under the influence of
french and italian humanism which led to the introduction of
a veiy large latin vocabulary while the proximity to germany
led to the popular adoption of an exceedingly large number
of german words polish hlerature had its golden age in
the 17th century but it is only in the 19th
century that it developed a rich literature especially in poetry
that is comparable with those of the d google slavic

superseded by vondriiks work for the study of church slavic

buu pnoportions especially by miletidi and tsonev and the serbocroatian
language has since the days of the founder of the

useful for the student bohemian was early treated bv dobrovsky

dictionary for the foreier is jungntanns the slovak has not

that by krytiski lbo wiener profetjor of slavic languages und
literatwrt harvard univeriity slavic mythology of slavic mythology we cannot
obtain a distinct picture owing to very defective traditions amonk
the peoples of slav race and perhaps still more be
cause of a great scarcity of records the early history
of this whole race is in fact shrouded in darkness
and we do not even definitely know the time of
the first arrival of slavic tribes in eunope we do
know it is true that some of them were heard
o as early as the 1st or 2d century of
the christian era but of their man ilers and customs
their vernacular and above all their creed and worship we
know next to nothing at that early time in some
regions of europe they appear to have preceded the teutons
and to have taken possession of the land while in
others they followed teutonic tribes such as the marcomanni in
what is now bohemia the vandals on the baltic the
goths and gepidx after these had started off on their
conquering migrations toward the west and south which were at
last to end in the destruc tion of the roman
empire so far as indica tions go the bulk of
the progenitors of the slavic populations of today seem to
have reached and in a manner settled on european soil
by the 5th and 6th centuries of our era but
in their shifting occupation of districts and slavs serbians bulgarians
croatians the poles and the czechs we do not even
posses the names of their early gods general speaking the
slavic creed consisted in a wor ship of the forces
of nature we find dim reminiscences of a heavengod svarcn
the vedic varana who apparently was acknowl edged more or
less by all slavs we encounter in the scant records
a solar deity dazhbog paid honors to by other tribes
under the name of khors fire was worshipped as ogon
vedic agni and the windgod as stribog with the northeastern
slavs the chief deity was periin the god of thunder
and lightning the vedic parjayna the teutonic donar or thor
the western slavs again along the baltic coast such as
the obotriti the vinds or wends etc paid homage to
a od radegast or radegost also named sviatovit or svantevit
the thre headed and treblygifted god triglatf of whose images
and devotional service detailed descrip tions have been given by
andent writers these western slavs too had temples and sacrificid
altars as well as priests but this does not seem
to have been the case with thie slavs of the

species of dualism of a cease less struggle between darkness

slavic term for foreier is nientsy dumb marking the differentiation
between those whose speech was intelligible to the slav ear
that is the slavs themselves and those who made use
of an incomprehensible tongue the connection be tween slav and
slave though supported by the analogy of servus and serb

of which they were deprived by the der mans large
pans of transylvania and hungary which fell to rumanians and
maeyars and eirts of the regions south of the danube
which ter passed to the greeks and the turks the
ancient slavs were almost exclusively an agricultural people averse to
all war and living in complete tribal independence under a
fully developed patriarchal system which at a later time became
blended with a communal form of government they were the
latest of all the eurcntean peoples to enter the sphere
of modem civilization their religion and their literature being as
compared with the other nations of recent date the eastern
branch of the slavs received its civilization and rehgion from
byzantium the western slavs from rome christianity made rapid headway
among them in spite of the fact that they seem
to have pos sessed a well developed naturecult xbout which
however we possess no definite information our materials are limited
to the names of vari ous deities worshipped among the
northern slavs while as to the mythology of the southern
branches of the race even such data is wanting among
the gods of the russian blavs were pcmu identified by
some with thor the north cm god of thunder dazbig
the day god wolos stribog and others svintovint or sviatovit
was the great god of the bahic slavs rijgen and
some who maintain thai along with their idolworship the slavs
possessed a belief in a supreme god would assign to
svintovint that role grimm erects svintovint pernu and a god
named radegasi into a trinity with functions corresponding to the
classic jupiter vulcan and mercury respectively other deities worshipped by
the slavs were prava the god of justice rugevit of
war triglaw lado and iada divinities o order ana love
dievana diana goddess of the woods and prija the scandinavian
freya among the silesian slavs the principles of light and
darkness were typified by the bielobog and the qiornobog the
while god and the black god the mythology of the
slavs was rich in deities of a lower order in
nymphs naiads and mountain sprites in goddesses of birth and
fate divinities of the hearth and the field in evil
demons and vampires the forms of the sla deities recall
to mind those of india mony to a belief entertained
by some of the slavs in the immortality of the
soul and a resur rection beyond the grave their principal
cele brations were the kobiada a feast held at the
beginning of the year when an interchange of presents was
customary the kupaio a feast that took place in honor
of the sun at the time of the summer solstice
and the trisna cele brated in honor of the dead
the functions of priest and ruler were combined in the
same from available data it is quite a hopeless task
to fix with any degree of certainly the ntmiber of
slavs in europe official statistics where issued are not always
reliable and independent authoritiee differ widely even on the quesdon
of how many slav languages there are it was not
until the first quarter of the 19th century that anv
serious attempt was made to estimate the slav populations s
chaff arik in 1826 arrived at a total of 55270000
in 1842 he made it 78000000 basing fais calculations on
these figures and those of the russian his torian pypine
prof louis leger of the insd tut de france struck
a total of 79550000 in 1868 zariankos russian geography 1891
gave a total of 101724000 while schraders atlas showed only
97000000 m niederle a bohemian authority estimated 139000000 in 1900
and reduced it to 138500000 in 1905 in 1907 a
distinguished russian scholar m florinsky arrived at 147146000 and calculated
that the annual birthrate of the slav race be ing
17 per cent it would increase by 2500000 per year
and would in consequence number 186000000 in 1915 and 200000000
in 1931 taking such figures as are available according in
each case to the bst census we find the slav
population of russia given as 92089733 austria 16959095 hungary 580190
serbia subjects only 2890602 bulgaria 3 203 810 montenegro about
500 000 a grand total of 121023430 most of these

the german poles nor the other slavs residing in germany
rumania turkey great britain etc only one census has been
taken in russia in 1897 during 1913 and 1914 there
were 1079 677 emigrants to the united states from coun
tries in europe having predominant slav popu lations mainly russia
and austria hungary while between 1911 and 1915 canada recdvea
144792 from those countries and numbers also went to south
america in the united states alone there are nearly 4000000
poles over 2000000 ciedis and slovaks and some 2000 000
jugo or southern slavs besides russians serbs etc the european
war and the balkan wars of 191213 exacted a heavy
toll of slav blood the great losses of russia on
the bat tlefields and in the anarchy following the revolution
the casualties among the slavs of the illfated austrohungarian armies
and the practical extermination of serbia besides bijl garian and
montenegrin losses must inevitably exert a seriously weakening influence upon
the slav race and disturb the value of statistics these
factors should be borne in mind with regard to the

and the sohd bulgarian group homogeneous except for the macedonian
slavs of which some lean to the bulgarians some to
the serbs and others who until 1913 claimed a separate
or macedonian nationality another method of grouping is as follows

sometimes being given as one group 4 russian including great

polish bulgarian serbocroatian and russian have sometimes been classified into
a southeastern slav croup as against a west cm group
consisting of all the others to the latter group should
be added the extinct pola bian the oldest of the
slavic tongues is the old church slavic or old bulgarian
which is still the ritual language of the greek orthodox
church in russia bulgaria and serbia the slavic languages are
marked by a richness of vowel sounds and sibilants and
a high degree of inflection which in the noun possesses
seven cases and in the verb in spite of a
restricted niunber of tenses a large number of modal and
effective auxiliaries rendering possible the finest distinctions of meaning the
socalled cyrillic alphabet is used in me russian bul garian
and serbian but the old church slavic makes use also
of the glagolitic alphabet qv the polish croatian czech slovenian
and sorb employ the roman characters slavic miwic sentiment which
forms so prominent a trait in the slav character renders
the members of that race peculiarly subject to the influence
of music in russia the origins are found in the
folksongs which were greatly influenced by the music of the
church in the j 7th century western influences entered the
country and especially the italian which lasted well into the
19th century when we have the use of a national
school with the appearance of glinka qv the prevailing characteristic
of russian music whether classic or popular is an all
pervading tone of melancholy which has found its fullest expression
periiaps in the works of tschaikowsky polish music in many
respects resembling the russian differs from the latter in a
greater vivacity of movement and spirit the bohemian is the
third impor tant nabonal school of slavic music and one
which in recent years has surpassed the polish in productivity

see shetana dvomk panslaviam this name was originally given to
the agitation carried on by a great party in russia
with the object of uniting tie slav peoples of europe
under russian rule or influence the movement originated about 1830
when the polish revolution aroused slavic national consciousness it received
increased strength from the second polish revolt in 1863 congresses
of slav representatives from the different european countries were held
at prague in 1348 and moscow m 1867 outside of
russia the ideals of panslavism were favor ably received by
the slavs in bohemia silesia and croatiaslavonia where the members
of that race felt their national existence threatened by the
repressive policy of the government austrian hungarian or german as
the case might be panslavism was largely responsible for the
outbreak of the russoturkish war of 187778 when russia entered
the lists as the champion of the balkan slavs who
suffered under the tyranny of turkish rule russia defeated the
turks with the assistance of ru mania nonslav bulgaria serbia
and mon tenegro slav nations though the berlin congress demohshed
the treaty of san ste fano the four nations were
made practically independent of turkey and russia became the recognized
protector of the balkan slavs it must be added however
that this big broth erly policy was not unconnected with
the old russian ideal of paving the road to constanti
nople moreover this balkan policy of russia tan counter to
the interests of the austrohun garian monarchy also a great
slav power this antagonism rendered impossible any rap prochement between
russia and germany the latter being austrias ally in this
may be recognized the seeds of the european war nothing
short cif an absolute renunciation by russia of her panslav
policy in the balkans could remove the imssibility of an
ultimate rup ture with austria in course of lime pan
slavism broke out in a direction that was per haps
not anticipated by russia as the balkan states grew stronger
under the stimulus of national consciousness fostered by the crea
tion of national armies and more or less demo cratic
institutions they gradually realized their ability to shape their own
destinies while fully willing to accept all the advantages which
the protection of russia offered they were not prepared to
fall under russian dominion stambulofl in bulgaria pursued a strong
anti russian policy and the serbs cast longing eyes upon
the vision of an independent greater serbia including the austrian
provinces of bosniaherzegovina and their nationals in macedonia then still
turkish territory not improbably they also counted on the inclusion
of croatia slavonia and the dalmatian coast tine after the
longprophesied breakup of the austrohungarian empire bulgaria likewise had designs
on macedonia bohemia clamored for her ancient rights as a
kingdom and the poles sought the restoration of their xiuntry
partitioned between russia germany and aus tria an ambition at
all times rigorously sup pressed by those three powers russia
stood to google lose comparatively fittle fey an allround frffil
ment of these naiional aspirations to ausfria hungary it meant
a dissolution of the mon archy hence the general principle
may be accepted that aostro russian rivalry plus the conflicting
aims of austria and serbia pro vided fully onehalf of
the direct causes of the european war and that germany
contributed the other moiety by utilizing this antagonism to further
her own ambitions the situation was thus summarized by president
wilson on 14 june 1917 the war was begun by
the mili tary masters of germany who proved to be
also the masters of austriahungary the demands made by austria
upon serbia were a mere single step in a plan

had attained gigantic proportions thou entirely diverted from its original
aims of uni fication into a revolutionary scheme of inde

be applied to it a powerful impetus to the cause
was the offi cial sympathy extended to its representatives in

president wilson declared in favor of an autonomous poland the
crecho slovak and jugoslav agitation in the aus trian parliament
spread throughout the mon archy and was enthusiastically supported by

during which there is partial abeyance of volition and consciousness
with a relaxed condition of the body and a lessened
activity of certain of the vital functions the muscles do
less work in the way of voluntary contrac tions and
there is therefore a diminution in this feature of their
tonicity the respirations are less frequent and rhythmical occasionally there
ts a lon expiratory pause the output of carbon dioxide
is diminished more than the consumption of oxygen the pulse
is less fre quent the secretions are partially suspended and
the pupils of the eyes are contracted the whole body

due to a rhythmical cycle habit of millions of years
of evolution and is chiefly a tropism reaction to light
and tem perature impressions it has been biologically developed by
reason of its value as a resting period for less
active energy transformation all parts of the body require such
rest as sleep affords and share directly or indirectly in
its benefits for functional activity without peri ods of rest
results in an undue destruction of the tissues and an
excess of poisonous jroducts the essence of the sleepsiate is
functional rest and nutritive repair though the brain in repose
it nevertheless is in function during sleep just as much
as all the rest of the boltly this activity is
registered in dream activity some of which remain in consciousness

outside influences the more readily is re freshing sleep obtained
sometimes pain assists to this end for example a man
is worried with business cares and has not slept well
of late one eveninfi he has a severe toothache which
demands his entire attention as the pain is relieved he
drops off into a quiet sleep and forgets his troubles

sons varies with age and condition the greater part of
infancy is generally passed in slumber which is more profound
than that of adults lo middle life from six to

comes at a definite time or in the case of
those accustomed to sleep amid noisy surroundinffs and who cannot
readily sleep in a quiet restingplace the disorders of sleep

sleepingsickness a peculiar dis order also called sleepingdisease african lethar
lethars negro lethargy and nelavan endemic especially in western africa
it is apparently infectious occurs mainly among negroes and is
said to be very fatal investi biiions by the english
government and by the iverpool school of tropical medicine show
that its prevalence has been exaggerated by the natives that
it has been confounded with other prevailing diseases which have
some of the same symptoms but are distinct affections the
natives in their dread of this malady are ready to
assert ihat a person having enlarged glands headache and a
dry skin and becoming thin and drowsy has sleepingsickness that
the disease prevails at times in certain localities and is
generally fatal is not disputed though continued and abnormal sleep
has not been present in all cases m christy in
july 1902 found an infected area in a strip of
coaslltline along the shore of victoria nyanza over 100 miles
in lenh and along the margins of all the islands
in the british portion of the vic toria nyanza cases
of the disease discovered back of this area were infected
he believes at the shore nearly all the cases of
sleeping mckness that he saw were in persons who had
lived on low swampy ground or near the water edge
in huts surrounded by bananaplants or forest growth compact villages
on dry land with but little surrounding foliage were not
seriously infected various theories as to the cause of the
dis ease have from lime to time been broached it
has been supposed to be due to foodintoxica tion like
pellagra ltqv or caused by one of the many animal
parasites common in africa disorders of circubtion mental depression bad
and insufficient food intestinal and blood para sites are predisposing
causes the recent in vestigations of bruce casteltani christy dut
ton forde and others show that sleepingsick ness is probably
caused by a parasite a spedes of trypanoboma which is
transdiitted from the sick to the healthy by a variety
of the tsetsefly this parasite enters the blooa and the
cerebro spinal fluid producing what is called by the recent
investigators human trypanosomiasis to distinguish it from the trypanosomiasis which
affects horses fish etc the species of tsetse fly in
question inhabits the places where sleep ingsickness is prevalent and
sambon believes that this fly is not only a carrier
of trypano somes but acts also as an intermediate host
and is troublesome to man at certain seasons autopsy in
cases of sleepingsickness shows chronic meningitis encephalitis meninmyelitis and trypanosomes
in the cerebro spinal fluid and blood the symptoms may
be divided into three stages one indefinite one of tremor
and a third stage of intense weakness true sleep is
not really a symptom of the disease there is at
first a disinclination to work or move about this is
followed by headache pains especially in the chest dullness slowness
in answering questions mumbling and a shuffling gait then there
are tremors of the tongue and hands glands may be
greatly enlarged but glandenlargement is common among the na tives

disease usually lasts from four to eight months the researches
